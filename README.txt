code1.ipynb: 
-complete collection of data and analysis for Vader and polarity approaches
-complete analysis for Bert approach

Folder To_run_code1: 
-everything you need to run code1.ipynb

Sentiment_ecological_Bert.ipynb: 
-to replicate our 3rd approach (Bert to recognise Ecological sentiment) you need this code plus the file ecological_bert (support code);it is possible to change the document in which the analysis is run in ecological_bert/src/predict_historical_10K. Results are in RESULTS folder.

Sentiment_FinBert.ipynb: 
-to replicate our 4th approach (FinBert for sentiment analysis) you need this code. Results are in RESULTS folder.

Select_ESG_sentences_via_Bert.ipynb:
-to replicate the selection of ESG sentences via BERT you need this code. One may need adaptation regarding the path of the 10_k reports within the notebooks. Results are in RESULTS folder.

Folder Data_analysis_summary_code:
-code of Data_analysis
-merged by industry reports(pre-processed and not pre-processed) (8 .txt files to run the code)

Folder Regression:
-folder 1: code for regression and data necessary to run the code
-folder 2: second code for regression (necessary data to run this code are all in Folder To_run_code1)
