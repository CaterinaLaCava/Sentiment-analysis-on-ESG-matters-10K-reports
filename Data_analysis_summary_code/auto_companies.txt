  Stock. Based on the New York Stock Exchange Composite Transaction closing price of the Common Stock on that date
  ($11.13 per share), the aggregate market value of such Common Stock was $43,956,659,969. Although there is no quoted
  market for our Class B Stock, shares of Class B Stock may be converted at any time into an equal number of shares of
  Common Stock for the purpose of effecting the sale or other disposition of such shares of Common Stock. The shares of
  Common Stock and Class B Stock outstanding at June 30, 2022 included shares owned by persons who may be deemed to
  be “affiliates” of Ford. We do not believe, however, that any such person should be considered to be an affiliate. For
  information concerning ownership of outstanding Common Stock and Class B Stock, see the Proxy Statement for Ford’s
  Annual Meeting of Stockholders currently scheduled to be held on May 11, 2023 (our “Proxy Statement”), which is

  ITEM 1. Business.

       Ford Motor Company was incorporated in Delaware in 1919. We acquired the business of a Michigan company, also
  known as Ford Motor Company, which had been incorporated in 1903 to produce and sell automobiles designed and
  engineered by Henry Ford. We are a global company based in Dearborn, Michigan. With about 173,000 employees
  worldwide, the Company is committed to helping build a better world, where every person is free to move and pursue their
  dreams. The Company’s Ford+ plan for growth and value creation combines existing strengths, new capabilities, and
  always-on relationships with customers to enrich experiences for customers and deepen their loyalty. Ford develops and
  delivers innovative, must-have Ford trucks, sport utility vehicles, commercial vans and cars, and Lincoln luxury vehicles,
  along with connected services. With our change in segments effective January 1, 2023, the Company does that through
  three customer-centered business segments: Ford Blue, engineering iconic gas-powered and hybrid vehicles; Ford Model e,
  inventing breakthrough electric vehicles (“EVs”) along with embedded software that defines always-on digital experiences for
  all customers; and Ford Pro, helping commercial customers transform and expand their businesses with vehicles and
  services tailored to their needs. Additionally, the Company is pursuing mobility solutions through Ford Next (previously
  Mobility) and provides financial services through Ford Motor Credit Company LLC (“Ford Credit”).

  Item 1. Business (Continued)


  OVERVIEW

      On January 1, 2023, we implemented a new operating model and reporting structure. With this change, we will analyze
  the results of our business through the following reportable segments: Ford Blue, Ford Model e, and Ford Pro (combined,
  replacing the Automotive segment); Ford Next (previously Mobility); and Ford Credit. As a result of the change, beginning
  with our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ending March 31, 2023, we will report our results in these five
  reportable segments. Company adjusted EBIT will include the financial results of these five reportable segments and
  Corporate Other, and net income will comprise the financial results of the five reportable segments and Corporate Other, as
  well as Interest on Debt, Special Items, and Taxes.

       Below is a description of our reportable segments and other activities as of December 31, 2022.

  AUTOMOTIVE SEGMENT

       The Automotive segment primarily includes the sale of Ford and Lincoln vehicles, service parts, and accessories
  worldwide, together with the associated costs to develop, manufacture, distribute, and service the vehicles, parts, and
  accessories. This segment includes revenues and costs related to our electrification vehicle programs and enterprise
  connectivity. The segment includes the following regional business units: North America, South America, Europe, China
  (including Taiwan), and the International Markets Group.

  General

       Our vehicle brands are Ford and Lincoln. In 2022, we sold approximately 4,231,000 vehicles at wholesale throughout
  the world. See “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” (“Item 7”)
  for a discussion of our calculation of wholesale unit volumes.

      Substantially all of our vehicles, parts, and accessories are sold through distributors and dealers (collectively,
  “dealerships”), the substantial majority of which are independently owned. At December 31, the approximate number of
  dealerships worldwide distributing our vehicle brands was as follows:
  Brand                                                                                                    2021              2022
  Ford                                                                                                            8,900             8,596
  Ford-Lincoln (combined)                                                                                           654               607
  Lincoln                                                                                                           401               408
    Total                                                                                                         9,955             9,611



     We do not depend on any single customer or a few customers to the extent that the loss of such customers would have
  a material adverse effect on our business.

       In addition to the products we sell to our dealerships for retail sale, we also sell vehicles to our dealerships for sale to
  fleet customers, including commercial fleet customers, daily rental car companies, and governments. We also sell parts and
  accessories, primarily to our dealerships (which, in turn, sell these products to retail customers) and to authorized parts
  distributors (which, in turn, primarily sell these products to retailers). We also offer extended service contracts.

        The worldwide automotive industry is affected significantly by general economic and political conditions over which we
  have little control. Vehicles are durable goods, and consumers and businesses have latitude in determining whether and
  when to replace an existing vehicle. The decision whether to purchase a vehicle may be affected significantly by slowing
  economic growth, geopolitical events, and other factors (including the cost of purchasing and operating cars, trucks, and
  utility vehicles and the availability and cost of financing and fuel). As a result, the number of cars, trucks, and utility vehicles
  sold may vary substantially from year to year. Further, the automotive industry is a highly competitive business that has a
  wide and growing variety of product and service offerings from a growing number of manufacturers.


                                                                    2

26/04/23, 09:00                                                            f-20221231
  Item 1. Business (Continued)


      Our wholesale unit volumes vary with the level of total industry demand and our share of that industry demand. Our
  wholesale unit volumes also are influenced by the level of dealer inventory, and our ability to maintain sufficient production
  levels to support desired dealer inventory in the event of supplier disruptions or other types of disruptions affecting our
  production. Our share is influenced by how our products are perceived by customers in comparison to those offered by other
  manufacturers based on many factors, including price, quality, styling, reliability, safety, fuel efficiency, functionality, and
  reputation. Our share also is affected by the timing and frequency of new model introductions. Our ability to satisfy
  changing consumer and business preferences with respect to type or size of vehicle, as well as design and performance
  characteristics, affects our sales and earnings significantly.

      As with other manufacturers, the profitability of our business is affected by many factors, including:

      •    Wholesale unit volumes
      •    Margin of profit on each vehicle sold - which, in turn, is affected by many factors, such as:
           ◦ Market factors - volume and mix of vehicles and options sold, and net pricing (reflecting, among other factors,
               incentive programs)
           ◦ Costs of components and raw materials necessary for production of vehicles
           ◦ Costs for customer warranty claims and additional service actions
           ◦ Costs for safety, emissions, and fuel economy technology and equipment
      •    A high proportion of relatively fixed structural costs, so that small changes in wholesale unit volumes can significantly
           affect overall profitability

      Although recent supply disruptions have resulted in near-term upward pressure on new vehicle prices, our industry has
  historically had a very competitive pricing environment, driven in part by excess capacity. For the past several decades,
  manufacturers typically have offered price discounts and other marketing incentives to provide value for customers and
  maintain market share and production levels, and we are beginning to see indications that some of these actions will resume
  in 2023 as industry production and inventories improve. The decline in value of foreign currencies in the past has also
  contributed significantly to competitive pressures in many of our markets.

      Competitive Position. The worldwide automotive industry consists of many producers, with no single dominant producer.
  Certain manufacturers, however, account for the major percentage of total sales within particular countries, especially their
  countries of origin.

       Seasonality. We manage our vehicle production schedule based on a number of factors, including retail sales (i.e., units
  sold by our dealerships to their customers at retail) and dealer stock levels (i.e., the number of units held in inventory by our
  dealerships for sale to their customers). Historically, we have experienced some seasonal fluctuation in the business, with
  production in many markets tending to be higher in the first half of the year to meet demand in the spring and summer
  (typically the strongest sales months of the year). In recent years, due to COVID-19, the semiconductor shortage, and other
  supply constraints, production has been higher in the second half of the year.

      Backlog Orders. During the past year, gross stock levels at dealers were lower than normal due largely to the
  semiconductor shortage and other supply constraints, and the amount of time required to fill orders for certain vehicles
  increased.

      Raw Materials. We purchase a wide variety of raw materials from numerous suppliers around the world for use in the
  production of, and development of technologies in, our vehicles. These materials include base metals (e.g., steel and
  aluminum), precious metals (e.g., palladium), energy (e.g., natural gas), and plastics/resins (e.g., polypropylene). As we
  transition to a greater mix of electric vehicles, we expect to increase our reliance on lithium, cobalt, nickel, graphite, and
  manganese, among other materials, for batteries. We expect to have adequate supplies or sources of availability of raw
  materials necessary to meet our needs; however, there always are risks and uncertainties with respect to the supply of raw
  materials that could impact availability in sufficient quantities and at cost effective prices to meet our needs. See “Item 1A.
  Risk Factors” for a discussion of the risks associated with a shortage of components or raw materials, supplier disruptions,
  and inflationary pressures, the “Key Trends and Economic Factors Affecting Ford and the Automotive Industry” section of
  Item 7 for a discussion of supplier disruptions caused by a shortage of key components, as well as commodity and energy
  price changes, and “Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk” (“Item 7A”) for a discussion of
  commodity price risks.

  Item 1. Business (Continued)


       Intellectual Property. We own or hold licenses to use numerous patents, trade secrets, copyrights, and trademarks on a
  global basis. We expect to continue building this portfolio as we actively pursue innovation in every part of our business.
  We also own numerous trademarks and service marks that contribute to the identity and recognition of our Company and its
  products and services globally. While our intellectual property rights in the aggregate are important to the operation of each
  of our businesses, we do not believe that our business would be materially affected by the expiration of any particular
  intellectual property right or termination of any particular intellectual property agreement.

       Warranty Coverage, Field Service Actions, and Customer Satisfaction Actions. We provide warranties on vehicles we
  sell. Warranties are offered for specific periods of time and/or mileage, and vary depending upon the type of product and the
  geographic location of its sale. Pursuant to these warranties, we will repair, replace, or adjust parts on a vehicle that are
  defective in factory-supplied materials or workmanship during the specified warranty period. In addition to the costs
  associated with this warranty coverage provided on our vehicles, we also incur costs as a result of field service actions (i.e.,
  safety recalls, emission recalls, and other product campaigns), and for customer satisfaction actions.

     For additional information regarding warranty and related costs, see “Critical Accounting Estimates” in Item 7 and
  Note 25 of the Notes to the Financial Statements.

  Wholesales

      Wholesales consist primarily of vehicles sold to dealerships. For the majority of such sales, we recognize revenue when
  we ship the vehicles to our dealerships from our manufacturing facilities. See Item 7 for additional discussion of revenue
  recognition practices. Wholesales in each region and in certain key markets within each region during the past three years
  were as follows:
                                                                                                                           Wholesales (a)

  Credit earns its revenue primarily from payments made under retail installment sale and finance lease (retail financing) and
  operating lease contracts that it originates and purchases; interest rate supplements and other support payments from us
  and our affiliates; and payments made under dealer financing programs.

       As a result of these financing activities, Ford Credit has a large portfolio of finance receivables and operating leases
  which it classifies into two portfolios —“consumer” and “non-consumer.” Finance receivables and operating leases in the
  consumer portfolio include products offered to individuals and businesses that finance the acquisition of our vehicles from
  dealers for personal and commercial use. Retail financing includes retail installment sale contracts for new and used
  vehicles and finance leases (comprised of sales-type and direct financing leases) for new vehicles to retail and commercial
  customers, including leasing companies, government entities, daily rental companies, and fleet customers. Finance
  receivables in the non-consumer portfolio include products offered to automotive dealers. Ford Credit makes wholesale
  loans to dealers to finance the purchase of vehicle inventory, also known as floorplan financing, as well as loans to dealers to
  finance working capital and improvements to dealership facilities, finance the purchase of dealership real estate, and finance
  other dealer vehicle programs. Ford Credit also purchases receivables generated by us and our affiliates, primarily related
  to the sale of parts and accessories to dealers and certain used vehicles from daily rental fleet companies. Ford Credit also
  provides financing to us for vehicles that we lease to our employees.

     The majority of Ford Credit’s business is in the United States and Canada. Outside of the United States, Europe is Ford
  Credit’s largest operation. Ford Credit’s European operations are managed primarily through its United Kingdom-based
  subsidiary, FCE Bank plc (“FCE”). Within Europe, Ford Credit’s largest markets are the United Kingdom and Germany.

      See Item 7 and Notes 10 and 12 of the Notes to the Financial Statements for a detailed discussion of Ford Credit’s
  receivables, credit losses, allowance for credit losses, loss-to-receivables ratios, funding sources, and funding strategies.
  See Item 7A for a discussion of how Ford Credit manages its financial market risks.

       We routinely sponsor special retail financing and lease incentives to dealers’ customers who choose to finance or lease
  our vehicles from Ford Credit. In order to compensate Ford Credit for the lower interest or lease payments offered to the
  retail customer, we pay the discounted value of the incentive directly to Ford Credit when it originates the retail finance or
  lease contract with the dealer’s customer. These programs increase Ford Credit’s financing volume and share. See Note 2
  of the Notes to the Financial Statements for information about our accounting for these programs.

      We have a Third Amended and Restated Relationship Agreement with Ford Credit, pursuant to which, if Ford Credit’s
  financial statement leverage for a calendar quarter were to be higher than 12.5:1 (as reported in its most recent periodic
  report), Ford Credit could require us to make or cause to be made a capital contribution to it in an amount sufficient to have
  caused such financial statement leverage to have been 12.5:1. No capital contributions have been made pursuant to this
  agreement. In a separate agreement with FCE, Ford Credit has agreed to maintain FCE’s net worth in excess of
  $500 million. No payments have been made pursuant to that agreement.

  CORPORATE OTHER

       Corporate Other primarily includes corporate governance expenses, interest income (excluding interest earned on our
  extended service contract portfolio that is included in our Automotive segment) and gains and losses from our cash, cash
  equivalents, and marketable securities (excluding gains and losses on investments in equity securities), and foreign
  exchange derivatives gains and losses associated with intercompany lending. Corporate governance expenses are primarily
  administrative, delivering benefit on behalf of the global enterprise, that are not allocated to operating segments. These
  include expenses related to setting and directing global policy, providing oversight and stewardship, and promoting the
  Company’s interests.

     Effective January 1, 2023, past service pension and other postretirement employee benefits (“OPEB”) income/expense
  and related assets, previously reported in the Automotive segment, were realigned to Corporate Other.

  INTEREST ON DEBT

      Interest on Debt consists of interest expense on Company debt excluding Ford Credit.

  GOVERNMENTAL STANDARDS

       Many governmental standards and regulations relating to safety, fuel economy, emissions control, noise control, vehicle
  recycling, substances of concern, vehicle damage, and theft prevention are applicable to new motor vehicles, engines, and
  equipment. In addition, manufacturing and other automotive assembly facilities are subject to stringent standards regulating
  air emissions, water discharges, and the handling and disposal of hazardous substances. The most significant of the
  standards and regulations affecting us are discussed below:

  Vehicle Emissions Control

       U.S. Requirements - Federal and California Tailpipe Emission Standards. Both the U.S. Environmental Protection
  Agency (“EPA”) and the California Air Resources Board (“CARB”) have established motor vehicle tailpipe and evaporative
  emissions standards that become increasingly stringent over time. Seventeen states have adopted California’s light-duty
  standards, four states have adopted California’s heavy-duty standards, and other states are expected to join. Both federal
  and California regulations also require motor vehicles to be equipped with on-board diagnostic (“OBD”) systems that monitor
  emission-related systems and components. In addition, light- and medium-duty vehicles and heavy-duty engines must be
  certified by EPA prior to sale in the United States and by CARB prior to sale in California and the relevant states. Canada
  accepts EPA certification. Compliance with emissions standards, OBD requirements, and related regulations can be
  challenging and can drive increased product development costs, warranty costs, and vehicle recalls.

      CARB has adopted new emissions regulations applicable to model year 2024 heavy-duty engines, as well as extended
  heavy-duty warranty requirements beginning with the 2022 model year, and EPA has proposed more stringent heavy-duty
  standards beginning with the 2027 model year. These rules include more stringent emissions standards, as well as new
  requirements affecting durability testing, warranty, and OBD. CARB has also adopted new light-duty emissions standards
  applicable to 2026 model year vehicles, including a more stringent emissions standard and other new emissions
  requirements. These new rules are expected to impose increased challenges and costs on the development of light-duty
  vehicles and heavy-duty engines.

       Compliance with automobile emissions standards depends in part on the widespread availability of high-quality and
  consistent automotive fuels that the vehicles were designed to use. Legislative, regulatory, and judicial developments related
  to fuel quality at both the national and state levels could affect vehicle manufacturers’ warranty costs as well as their ability to
  comply with vehicle emissions standards.


                                                                    7




https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/37996/000003799623000012/f-20221231.htm                                                   11/183
26/04/23, 09:00                                                            f-20221231
  Item 1. Business (Continued)


       The California vehicle emissions program also includes requirements for manufacturers to produce and deliver for sale
  zero-emission vehicles (“ZEVs”). California’s light-duty vehicle ZEV regulation, which uses a system based on credits that
  can be banked and carried forward, mandates annual increases in the production and sale of battery-electric, fuel cell, and
  plug-in hybrid vehicles. For 2025 model year, this regulation will require approximately 22% of a manufacturer’s California
  light-duty vehicle sales volume be ZEVs. In August 2022, California approved a sweeping revision to the ZEV regulation.
  Beginning with the 2026 model year, the revised ZEV rule mandates a 35% ZEV sales requirement, rising to 100% by 2035.
  The revised regulation also imposes significant restrictions on credit usage, and new requirements for EV battery durability.
  California has also instituted ZEV regulations governing medium- and heavy-duty vehicles, beginning with the 2024 model
  year. These stringent ZEV requirements covering light-, medium-, and heavy-duty vehicles could entail significant costs and
  compliance challenges, and include complex warranty and recall requirements. Compliance with ZEV rules depends on
  market conditions (including the pace of adoption of EVs), technology readiness, and battery raw material availability as well
  as the availability of adequate infrastructure to support vehicle charging.

       European Requirements. European Union (“EU”) and U.K. regulations, directives, and related legislation limit the amount
  of regulated pollutants that may be emitted by new motor vehicles and engines sold in the EU and the United Kingdom.
  Regulatory stringency has increased significantly with the application of Stage VI emission standards (first introduced in
  2014) and the implementation of a laboratory test cycle for CO2 and emissions and the introduction of on-road emission
  testing using portable emission analyzers (Real Driving Emission or “RDE”). These on-road emission tests are in addition to
  the laboratory-based tests (first introduced in 2017). The divergence between the regulatory limit that is tested in laboratory
  conditions and the allowed values measured in RDE tests will ultimately be reduced to zero as the regulatory demands
  increase. In addition, new requirements for tailpipe and non-tailpipe emissions will be included in the upcoming Euro 7
  regulation, and the lead-time for engineering and type approval may potentially be too short. The costs associated with
  complying with all of these requirements are significant, and following the EU Commission’s indication of its intent to
  accelerate emissions rules in its road map publication “EU Green Deal” as well as the EU sustainable mobility action plan,
  these challenges will continue in European markets, including the United Kingdom. In addition, the Whole Vehicle Type
  Approval (“WVTA”) regulation has been updated to increase the stringency of in-market surveillance. Moreover, following the
  U.K.’s withdrawal from the European Union, we may be subject to diverging requirements in our European markets, which
  could increase vehicle complexity and duties.

      There is an increasing trend of city access restrictions for internal combustion engine powered vehicles. The access
  rules being introduced are developed by individual cities based on their specific concerns, resulting in rapid deployment of
  access rules that differ greatly among cities. The speed of implementation of access rules may directly influence customer
  vehicle residual values and choice of next purchase. In an effort to support the Paris Accord, some countries are adopting
  yearly increases in CO2 taxes, where such a system is in place, and publishing dates by when internal combustion powered
  vehicles may no longer be registered, e.g., Norway in 2025 and the United Kingdom and the Netherlands in 2030.

        Other National Requirements. Many countries, in an effort to address air quality and climate change concerns, are
  adopting previous versions of European or United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (“UN-ECE”) mobile source
  emission regulations. Some countries have adopted more advanced regulations based on the most recent version of
  European or U.S. regulations. For example, the China Stage VI light-duty vehicle emission standards, based on European
  Stage VI emission standards for light-duty vehicles, U.S. evaporative and refueling emissions standards, and CARB OBD II
  requirements, incorporate two levels of stringency for tailpipe emissions. Under the level one (VI(a)) standard, which is
  currently in place nationwide in China, the emissions limits are comparable to the EU Stage VI limits, except for carbon
  monoxide, which is 30% lower than the EU Stage VI limit. The more stringent level two (VI(b)) standard’s emissions limits are
  approximately 30-50% lower than the EU Stage VI limits, depending on the pollutant. While level two (VI(b)) is not slated for
  nationwide implementation until July 2023, the government has encouraged the more economically developed cities and
  provinces to pull ahead implementation. For example, Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Hebei province, and Guangdong province
  have all begun implementing level two (VI(b)). Both China Stage VII light-duty vehicle and heavy duty vehicle emission
  regulations are currently under pre-study, and the Ministry of Ecology and Environment has advised that the Stage VII
  regulations will have more stringent limits on pollutant emissions and will establish limits for greenhouse gas (primarily CO2)
  tailpipe emissions. In South America, most countries are evolving to implement more stringent requirements accepting
  Europe and U.S. regulations, except Brazil, which has a unique local process called PROCONVE based on U.S. regulations
  for light-duty vehicles and European regulations for heavy-duty vehicles.

26/04/23, 09:00                                                            f-20221231
  Item 1. Business (Continued)


        Canadian criteria emissions regulations are largely aligned with U.S. requirements; however, the existing ZEV
  regulations in Quebec and those published in British Columbia in July 2020 are more stringent than those in place in
  California. Both British Columbia and Quebec have proposed draft amendments to their regulations to increase requirements
  starting in 2025 and 2026, respectively. The federal government has published draft light-duty ZEV sales requirements
  through an amendment to the Passenger Automobile and Light Truck Greenhouse Gas Emission Regulations and has also
  published its intent to develop ZEV sales requirements for heavy-duty vehicles. Other provinces have signaled their interest
  in light-duty ZEV sales regulations but are awaiting the finalization of the federal ZEV regulations.

      Elsewhere, there is a mix of regulations and processes based on U.S. and EU standards. Not all countries have adopted
  appropriate fuel quality standards to accompany the stringent emission standards adopted. This could lead to compliance
  problems, particularly if OBD or in-use surveillance requirements are implemented.

      Global Developments. In recent years, EPA and CARB have increased their focus on the use of “defeat devices.” Defeat
  devices are elements of design (typically embedded in software) that improperly cause the emission control system to
  function less effectively during normal on-road driving than during an official laboratory emissions test, without justification.
  They are prohibited by law in many jurisdictions, and we do not use defeat devices in our vehicles.

       Regulators around the world continue to scrutinize automakers’ emission testing, which has led to a number of defeat
  device settlements by various manufacturers. EPA is carrying out additional non-standard tests as part of its vehicle
  certification program. CARB has also been conducting extensive non-standard emission tests, which in some cases have
  resulted in certification delays for diesel vehicles. In the past, several European countries have conducted non-standard
  emission tests and published the results, and, in some cases, this supplemental testing has triggered investigations of
  manufacturers for possible defeat devices. Testing is expected to continue on an ongoing basis. In addition, plaintiffs’
  attorneys are pursuing consumer class action lawsuits based on alleged excessive emissions from cars and trucks, which
  could, in turn, prompt further investigations by regulators.

  Vehicle Fuel Economy and Greenhouse Gas Standards

       U.S. Requirements - Light-Duty Vehicles. Federal law requires that light-duty vehicles meet minimum corporate average
  fuel economy (“CAFE”) standards set by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (“NHTSA”). Manufacturers are
  subject to substantial civil penalties if they fail to meet the CAFE standard in any model year, after taking into account all
  available credits for the preceding five model years and expected credits for the three succeeding model years. The law
  requires NHTSA to promulgate and enforce separate CAFE standards applicable to each manufacturer’s fleet of domestic
  passenger cars, imported passenger cars, and light-duty trucks.

      EPA also regulates vehicle greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions under the Clean Air Act. Because the vast majority of
  GHGs emitted by a vehicle are the result of fuel combustion, GHG emission standards are similar to fuel economy
  standards. Thus, NHTSA and EPA coordinate with each other on their fuel economy and GHG standards, respectively, to
  avoid potential inconsistencies.

      Beginning with the 2012 model year, EPA and NHTSA jointly promulgated harmonized GHG and fuel economy
  regulations under what came to be known as the “One National Program” (“ONP”) framework. California, which had
  promulgated its own state-specific set of GHG regulations, agreed that compliance with the federal program would satisfy
  compliance with its own GHG requirements, thereby avoiding a patchwork of potentially conflicting federal and state GHG
  standards. ONP has required manufacturers to achieve increasingly stringent year-over-year standards.

       ONP was envisioned to continue at least through the 2025 model year. In 2020, EPA introduced significantly less
  stringent fuel economy and GHG standards applicable to model years 2021-2026. The federal government also revoked
  California’s authority to set and enforce its own vehicle GHG standards, as well as the authority of other states that opted in
  to California’s standards. California continued to assert its authority to regulate vehicle GHGs, challenged in court the federal
  government’s preemption actions, withdrew from ONP, and planned to return to enforcing its own state-specific GHG
  standards.




                                                                    9




https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/37996/000003799623000012/f-20221231.htm                                                13/183
26/04/23, 09:00                                                            f-20221231
  Item 1. Business (Continued)


      The litigation over both standards and preemption, with uncertain outcomes, created difficulty for purposes of Ford’s
  future product planning. To avoid a “bifurcated” regulatory scenario in which California and the 15 other states that adopted
  California’s GHG standards enforce one set of rules, while a different set of rules applies in the rest of the country, Ford
  reached an agreement with California on a set of terms for an alternative framework in which Ford committed to meet a
  designated set of standards on a national basis in lieu of the California regulatory program. This framework enabled Ford to
  continue its product planning on a nationwide basis, while being consistent with Ford’s environmental goals. Ford finalized its
  agreement with California in 2020, and other states that adopted the California standards indicated they would respect the
  agreement.

      In 2021, EPA again re-evaluated the stringency of light-duty fuel economy and GHG standards through the 2026 model
  year, and considered whether to restore the stringency to the previous ONP levels, or greater. EPA finalized this evaluation in
  December 2021, establishing GHG standards applicable to model years 2023-2026 with stringency that exceeded ONP
  levels. In 2022, NHTSA finalized more stringent fuel economy standards for model years 2024-2026, which are substantially
  aligned with EPA’s GHG standards. The federal government also acted in December 2021 to repeal its rule blocking
  California’s authority to set and enforce its own vehicle GHG standards, as well as the authority of other states that adopted
  California’s standards, and EPA took similar action in early 2022 under the Clean Air Act. In late 2022, EPA began
  consideration of sweeping changes to light-duty GHG regulations for model years 2027 and beyond. These regulations are
  expected to extend through at least the 2030 model year, and to drive significant ZEV sales mix, along with rapid
  improvement of ICE vehicle performance, by virtue of greatly increased stringency. These new rules are expected to impose
  increased challenges and costs on the development of light-duty vehicles. If any federal or state agency imposes and
  enforces fuel economy and GHG standards that are misaligned with market conditions, Ford would likely be forced to take
  various actions that could have substantial adverse effects on its sales volumes and results of operations. Such actions likely
  would include restricting offerings of selected engines and popular options; increasing market support programs for Ford’s
  most fuel-efficient vehicles; and ultimately curtailing the production and sale of certain vehicles, such as high-performance
  cars, utilities, and/or full-size light trucks in order to maintain compliance.

       U.S. Requirements - Heavy-Duty Vehicles. EPA and NHTSA have jointly promulgated GHG and fuel economy standards
  for heavy-duty vehicles (generally, vehicles over 8,500 pounds gross vehicle weight rating) through the 2027 model year, and
  EPA is preparing a major update to these standards for the 2027 model year and beyond. In Ford’s case, the standards
  primarily affect heavy-duty pickup trucks and vans, plus vocational vehicles such as shuttle buses and delivery trucks. As the
  heavy-duty standards increase in stringency, it may become more difficult to comply while continuing to offer a full lineup of
  heavy-duty trucks.

       European Requirements. The European Union regulates passenger car and light commercial vehicle CO2 emissions
  using sliding scales with different CO2 targets for each manufacturer based on the respective average vehicle weight for its
  fleet of vehicles first registered in a calendar year, with separate targets for passenger cars and light commercial vehicles. A
  penalty system applies to manufacturers failing to meet the individual CO2 targets. Pooling agreements between
  manufacturers to utilize credits are possible under certain conditions, and we have entered into such pooling agreements in
  order to comply with fuel economy regulations without paying a penalty and to enable other manufacturers to benefit from
  our positive CO2 performance. For “multi-stage vehicles” (e.g., Ford’s Transit chassis cabs), the base manufacturer (e.g.,
  Ford) is fully responsible for the CO2 performance of the final up-fitted vehicles. The initial target levels get significantly more
  stringent every five years (2025, 2030, and 2035, after which all new vehicles must be zero emission), requiring significant
  investments in propulsion technologies and extensive fleet management forcing low CO2 emissions. The United Kingdom
  and Switzerland have introduced similar rules, and the United Kingdom is considering adopting ZEV mandates.

      The EU Commission is investigating the introduction of Real Driving CO2 and Life Cycle Assessment elements, and
  heavy-duty vehicles are addressed in separate regulations with analogous requirements and challenges. As discussed
  above, the EU Commission has announced a “Green Deal” that is likely to trigger more stringent requirements for CO2
  emissions (including stricter CO2 fleet regulations) and other regulated emissions and include recycling and substance
  restrictions. While the EU Commission targets net climate neutrality by 2050 and a more ambitious 2030 interim target (a
  55% instead of 40% CO2 reduction compared to 1990), several countries, such as Germany, have adopted stricter interim
  targets and earlier net climate neutrality targets.

      Ford also faces the risk of advance premium payments for both passenger cars and light commercial vehicles in all
  European markets due to, for example, unexpected market fluctuations and shorter lead times impacting average fleet
  performance.




                                                                    10

26/04/23, 09:00                                                            f-20221231
  Item 1. Business (Continued)


      The United Nations developed a technical regulation for passenger car emissions and CO2. This world light-duty test
  procedure (“WLTP”) is focused primarily on better aligning laboratory CO2 and fuel consumption figures with customer-
  reported figures. The introduction of WLTP in Europe started in September 2017 and requires updates to CO2 labeling,
  thereby impacting taxes in countries with a CO2 tax scheme as well as CO2 fleet regulations for passenger cars and light
  commercial vehicles. Costs associated with new or incremental testing for WLTP are significant.

       Some European countries have implemented or are considering other initiatives for reducing CO2 vehicle emissions,
  including fiscal measures and CO2 labeling to address country specific targets associated with the Paris Accord. For
  example, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Spain, Portugal, and the Netherlands, among others, have introduced
  taxation based on CO2 emissions. The EU CO2 requirements are likely to trigger further measures. In addition, delayed
  vehicle launches and supply shortages, as well as an insufficient charging infrastructure and lower demand for ZEV and low
  CO2 emission vehicles as certain electric vehicle incentives are reduced, can trigger compliance risks in all European
  markets.

      Other National Requirements. The Canadian federal government regulates vehicle GHG emissions under the Canadian
  Environmental Protection Act. In October 2014, the Canadian federal government published the final changes to the
  regulation for light-duty vehicles, which maintain alignment with U.S. EPA vehicle GHG standards for the 2017-2025 model
  years. The revised U.S. EPA standards were automatically adopted in Canada by reference for the 2022-2025 model years,
  and draft amendments for a few standalone administrative elements not automatically adopted by reference were published
  in December 2022. The heavy-duty vehicle and engine GHG emissions regulations for the 2021 model year and beyond
  were published in May 2018 and are in line with U.S. requirements, subject to any change in those requirements.

       China’s Corporate Average Fuel Consumption and New Energy Vehicle (“NEV”) Credit Administrative Rules contain fuel
  consumption requirements as well as credit mandates for NEV passenger vehicles, i.e., plug-in hybrids, battery electric
  vehicles, or fuel cell vehicles. The fuel consumption requirement uses a weight-based approach to establish targets, with
  year-over-year target reductions. China set a target of 5.0L/100km for the 2020 passenger vehicle industry fuel consumption
  fleet average, which lowers to 4.0L/100km by 2025 based on the New European Driving Cycle system. The government is
  projecting a further fuel consumption reduction in 2030, and is targeting 3.5L/100km based on the WLTP cycle (“WLTC”)
  system. The NEV mandate requires that OEMs generate a specific amount of NEV credits each year, with NEV credits of at
  least 16%, 18%, 28%, and 38% of the annual ICE passenger vehicle production or import volume required in 2022, 2023,
  2024, and 2025, respectively. Future percentages are currently under consideration.

      As discussed below in Item 1A. Risk Factors under “Ford may need to substantially modify its product plans to comply
  with safety, emissions, fuel economy, autonomous vehicle, and other regulations,” a production disruption, stop ship, lower
  than planned market acceptance of our vehicles, or other intervening events may cause us to modify our product plans or, in
  some cases, purchase credits in order to comply with fuel economy standards.

  Vehicle Safety

       U.S. Requirements. The National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1966 (the “Safety Act”) regulates vehicles and
  vehicle equipment in two primary ways. First, the Safety Act prohibits the sale in the United States of any new vehicle or
  equipment that does not conform to applicable vehicle safety standards established by NHTSA. Meeting or exceeding many
  safety standards is costly and has continued to evolve as global compliance and public domain (e.g., New Car Assessment
  Programs (“NCAPs”), Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (“IIHS”)) requirements continue to evolve, are increasing in
  demands, and lack harmonization globally. As we expand our business priorities to include autonomous vehicles and
  broader mobility products and services, our financial exposure has increased. Second, the Safety Act requires that defects
  related to motor vehicle safety be remedied through safety recall campaigns. A manufacturer is obligated to recall vehicles if
  it determines the vehicles do not comply with a safety standard. Should we or NHTSA determine that either a safety defect or
  noncompliance issue exists with respect to any of our vehicles, the cost of such recall campaigns could be substantial.

       European Requirements. The EU has established vehicle safety standards and regulations and is likely to adopt
  additional or more stringent requirements in the future, especially in the areas of access to in-vehicle data, artificial
  intelligence, and autonomous vehicles.

  Item 1. Business (Continued)


       The European General Safety Regulation (“GSR”) introduced UN-ECE regulations, which are required for the European
  Type Approval process. The GSR includes the mandatory introduction of multiple active and passive safety features,
  including cybersecurity requirements for new vehicle models from 2022 and for all registrations in 2024. EU regulators are
  focusing on active safety features, such as lane departure warning systems, electronic stability control, and automatic brake
  assist. Furthermore, mobile network providers in certain EU Member States have begun shutting down their 2G and 3G
  networks, which form the basis for e-Call system functionality in existing vehicles. The e-Call systems in existing vehicles
  may need to be updated as these systems are phased out. It is also possible that the EU may mandate Member States to
  maintain these networks to allow for the continued functionality of existing e-Call systems.

       Other National Requirements. Globally, governments generally have been adopting UN-ECE based regulations with
  minor variations to address local concerns. Any difference between North American and UN-ECE based regulations can add
  complexity and costs to the development of global platform vehicles, and we continue to support efforts to harmonize
  regulations to reduce vehicle design complexity while providing a common level of safety performance; several on-going
  bilateral negotiations on free trade can potentially contribute to this goal.

       Safety and recall requirements in Brazil, China, India, South Korea, and Gulf Cooperation Council (“GCC”) countries may
  add substantial costs and complexity to our global recall practice. Brazil has set mandatory fleet safety targets and penalties
  are applied if these levels are not maintained, while a tax reduction may be available for over-performance. In Canada,
  regulatory requirements are currently aligned with U.S. regulations; however, under the Canadian Motor Vehicle Safety Act,
  the Minister of Transport has broad powers to order manufacturers to submit a notice of defect or non-compliance when the
  Minister considers it to be in the interest of safety. In 2021, Canada started preliminary consultations on several new
  proposed regulations, including Administrative Monetary Penalties (“AMPs”) and Analysis of Technical Information for
  Vehicles and Equipment (“ACTIVE”) regulations. Draft language for the AMPs regulation was published in May 2022 with
  final regulations expected to be published at the end of 2023. In China, a new mandatory Event Data Recorder regulation
  that is more comprehensive than U.S. requirements has been released, and in China, Malaysia, and South Korea,
  mandatory e-Call requirements are being drafted. E-Call is mandatory in the UAE for new vehicles starting with the 2021
  model year, and in Saudi Arabia from the 2025 model year.

      New Car Assessment Programs. Organizations around the world rate and compare motor vehicles in NCAPs to provide
  consumers and businesses with additional information about the safety of new vehicles. NCAPs use crash tests and other
  evaluations that are different than what is required by applicable regulations, and use stars to rate vehicle safety, with five
  stars awarded for the highest rating and one for the lowest. Achieving high NCAP ratings, which may vary by country or
  region, can add complexity and cost to vehicles. Similarly, environmental rating systems exist in various regions, e.g., Green
  NCAP in Europe. In China, C-NCAP has a stringent rating structure to decrease the number of five-star ratings. Further, the
  China Insurance Auto Safety Index (similar to IIHS) has been implemented, with higher standards for passenger and
  pedestrian protection and driver assistance technologies. These protocols impose additional requirements relating to testing,
  evaluation, and mandatory safety features, and compliance with them (or any subsequent updates to them) may be costly.

  HUMAN CAPITAL RESOURCES

  People Strategy and Governance

       We strive to create an employee experience that enables an inclusive environment of excellence, focus, and
  collaboration among team members, allowing us to deliver short- and long-term business success. Ford maintains an
  Executive People Forum consisting of the CEO and top leadership team that meets monthly with a specific focus on people
  and organizational topics that will enable and accelerate delivery of the business plan. Key topic areas include
  Compensation & Retention, Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (“DEI”), Organization Design, Talent Planning & Development,
  and Culture.

       Our Board of Directors and Board committees provide important oversight on certain human capital matters, including
  items discussed at the Executive People Forum. The Compensation, Talent and Culture Committee maintains responsibility
  to review, discuss, and set strategic direction for various people-related business strategies, including: compensation and
  benefit programs; leadership succession planning; culture; DEI; and talent development programs. The Sustainability,
  Innovation and Policy Committee is responsible for discussing and advising management on maintaining and improving
  sustainability strategies, the implementation of which creates value consistent with the long-term preservation and
  enhancement of shareholder value and social wellbeing, including human rights, working conditions, and responsible
  sourcing. The collective recommendations to the Board and its committees are how we proactively manage our human
  capital and create an employee experience that allows employees and our organization to thrive.

  Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion

      At Ford, we believe that creating a Culture of Inclusion for all our employees is both foundational to achieving our Ford+
  plan and the right thing to do. Ford offers 12 Employee Resource Groups (“ERGs”) that represent various dimensions of our
  employee population, including racial, ethnic, gender, religious, sexual orientation and gender identity, ability, and
  generational communities with chapters throughout the world, in addition to Ford Advocacy for Belonging (“FAB”) Councils in
  every region. Our ERGs and FAB Councils are instrumental in providing a voice to our globally diverse workforce as well as
  sharing valuable insights into the development of products, services, and experiences.

      Our business has developed DEI action plans specific to each region’s unique needs and culture. From an enterprise
  perspective, we have taken several concrete steps to further these efforts, including embedding DEI into our corporate
  strategy and governance, ensuring that revisions to employee expected behaviors enable an inclusive culture, and
  establishing objectives for progress for every salaried employee. This holistic DEI strategy includes a strong focus on racial
  equity, growing representation of diverse talent throughout the pipeline, and DEI education.

      Our diversity statistics include the following as of December 31, 2022 (based on self-reporting at the date of hire): 28.8%
  of our salaried employees worldwide are females (excludes certain employees in Europe in accordance with the European
  Union’s General Data Protection Regulation); 25.4% of our total salaried and hourly employees in the United States are
  females; and 36.2% of our total salaried and hourly employees in the United States are minorities.

  Talent Attraction, Growth, and Capability Assessment

      The workplace is quickly evolving, and new working practices are constantly developing. Many employees are no longer
  bound to physical locations, where and how we source our talent is evolving, and employee expectations have shifted. From
  a growth perspective, we are focused on several key areas vital to our success (e.g., software, electrification, and data
  science). Ford continues to accelerate its efforts to attract new employees with diverse skill sets and capabilities, and more
  resources have been dedicated to recruiting these employees, who are critical to supporting our business model.

      From a capability perspective, we are leveraging best practices in assessments and talent management to strengthen
  our current capabilities and future pipeline while reinforcing a culture of belonging, collaboration, empowerment, and
  innovation. The performance management process is reviewed regularly to ensure we set clear expectations, measure
  individual performance, and reward appropriately. We are also creating targeted learning experiences, democratizing
  learning and career development opportunities across the organization, and empowering employees to design their own
  career paths with skill development targeted for the roles of today and the future.



                                                                    13

26/04/23, 09:00                                                            f-20221231
  Item 1. Business (Continued)


      Finally, the extent to which our People Leaders are equipped to care for, inspire, and empower our people plays a vital
  role in our strategy, and we are committed to helping our leaders strengthen these capabilities with dedicated learning paths
  and non-traditional learning opportunities. Our Leadership+ mechanism for developing People Leaders guides how we think
  about performance management and how we assess our talent to meet our organizational needs. Leadership+ will continue
  to prepare and empower our People Leaders to lead our teams through significant change at our Company and in our
  industry.

  Employee Health and Safety

       Nothing is more important than the health, safety, and wellbeing of our employees, and we consistently strive to achieve
  world-class levels of safety through the application of sound policies and best practices. We maintain a robust safety culture
  to reduce workplace injuries, supported by effective communication, reporting, and external benchmarking. We verify
  compliance with regulatory requirements as well as our internal safety standards and regularly report to Company
  management on key safety issues, including significant incidents and high potential near-misses, to prevent recurrences. We
  also participate in multi-industry groups, within and outside the automotive sector, to share safety best practices and
  collaborate to address common issues.

  Our Safety Record

       Any loss of life or serious injury in the workplace is unacceptable and deeply regretted. Unfortunately, there were two
  fatal incidents in 2022 in our China region. Another key safety indicator is our global lost-time case rate (“LTCR”), which is
  defined as the number of cases where one or more working days is lost due to work-related injury/illness per 200,000 hours
  worked. While our global LTCR remains stable overall, there was an increase to 0.39 in 2022 from 0.35 in 2021. We will
  continue our efforts to reduce workplace injuries.

  Employee Wellbeing Initiatives

      Our global, holistic approach to wellbeing encompasses the financial, social, mental/emotional, physical, and
  professional needs of our employees. Foundational to our wellbeing philosophy is providing a broad array of resources and
  solutions to educate employees, build capability, and meet individual and organizational wellbeing needs and goals.
  Wellbeing is an integral part of our total rewards strategy as we work to address business and employee challenges through
  a multi-channel approach that provides our diverse populations and global regions flexibility and choice to meet their specific
  needs.

      We use data-driven insights gathered through surveys, focus groups, and claims data to understand employee needs
  and prioritize our wellbeing efforts. We provide global wellbeing programs, such as Employee Assistance Programs and
  mindfulness sessions, among other things. In addition, we provide employees with experiences, self-guided tools, and social
  connection opportunities, as well as access to the professional support and resources they need to achieve their own sense
  of wellbeing. We are committed to creating an environment where employees and People Leaders care for each other as we
  deliver Ford+.

  Employee Sentiment Strategy

      We leverage our ask/listen/observe framework to understand employee sentiment at Ford. This approach is a holistic
  and consistent methodology that enables us to understand how employees are feeling in real time and act accordingly. Our
  measurement focuses on several areas that are key to our business: Employee Mental and Emotional Wellbeing, Health &
  Safety, Employee Experience, Culture, DEI, Leadership, and Strategic Alignment. Our employee sentiment surveys guide
  the actions we take to address employee concerns and related risks, and also help us understand whether our efforts to
  drive change in these areas are effective.

      A critical element of our measurement program is ensuring that data ends up in the hands of those who are best
  positioned to drive meaningful change. To this end, leaders at all levels have access to dashboards with data from their
  teams and organizations, as well as personalized next step recommendations embedded into action planning tools. Our
  measurement approach is also used to inform our areas of focus as an organization and to evaluate the effectiveness of
  talent initiatives across the enterprise.

  Workers of America (“UAW” or “United Auto Workers”). At December 31, 2022, approximately 57,000 hourly employees in
  the United States were represented by the UAW.

  ITEM 1A. Risk Factors.

     We have listed below the material risk factors applicable to us grouped into the following categories: Operational Risks;
  Macroeconomic, Market, and Strategic Risks; Financial Risks; and Legal and Regulatory Risks.

  Operational Risks

       Ford and Ford Credit’s financial condition and results of operations have been and may continue to be
  adversely affected by public health issues, including epidemics or pandemics such as COVID-19. We face various
  risks related to public health issues, including epidemics, pandemics, and other outbreaks, including the global outbreak of
  COVID-19. The impact of COVID-19, including changes in consumer behavior, pandemic fears and market downturns, and
  restrictions on business and individual activities, has periodically created significant volatility in the global economy. There
  have been extraordinary actions taken by international, federal, state, and local public health and governmental authorities to
  contain and combat the outbreak and spread of COVID-19 in regions throughout the world, including travel bans,
  quarantines, “stay-at-home” orders, and similar mandates for many individuals to substantially restrict daily activities and for
  many businesses to curtail or cease normal operations. For example, in 2020, consistent with the actions taken by
  governmental authorities, we idled our manufacturing operations in regions around the world before ultimately resuming our
  manufacturing operations taking a phased approach and after introducing new safety protocols at our plants. To the extent
  cases surge in any locations, stringent limitations on daily activities that may have been eased previously could be reinstated
  in those areas. A future suspension of our manufacturing operations could have a significant adverse effect on our financial
  condition and results of operations. Moreover, outbreaks in certain regions continue to cause intermittent disruptions in our
  supply chain and local manufacturing operations. For example, in China, outbreaks of COVID-19 have led the government to
  impose lockdowns and other restrictions, which have adversely affected our and our supply chain’s production operations,
  our wholesales, and consumer demand for our products. Further, as new strains or variants of COVID-19 or other viruses,
  diseases, or public health issues develop or sufficient amounts of vaccines or treatments are not available, not widely
  administered for a significant period of time, or otherwise prove ineffective, the impact of a widespread public health issue on
  the global economy, and, in turn, our financial condition, liquidity, and results of operations could be material.

      The predominant share of Ford Credit’s business consists of financing Ford and Lincoln vehicles, and the duration or
  resurgence of public health issues such as COVID-19 may negatively impact the level of originations at Ford Credit. For
  example, Ford’s suspension of manufacturing operations, a significant decline in dealer showroom traffic, and/or a reduction
  of operations at dealers may lead to a significant decline in Ford Credit’s consumer and non-consumer originations.
  Moreover, economic uncertainty and higher unemployment arising from widespread public health issues or otherwise may
  result in higher defaults in Ford Credit’s consumer portfolio, and prolonged unemployment may have a negative impact on
  both new and used vehicle demand.

      As described in more detail below under “Ford and Ford Credit’s access to debt, securitization, or derivative markets
  around the world at competitive rates or in sufficient amounts could be affected by credit rating downgrades, market volatility,
  market disruption, regulatory requirements, or other factors,” the volatility created by COVID-19 adversely affected Ford and
  Ford Credit’s access to the debt and securitization markets and its cost of funding, and any volatility in the capital markets as
  a result of a public health issue or for any other reason could have an adverse impact on Ford and Ford Credit’s access to
  those markets and its cost of funding.

       The full impact of COVID-19 or any widespread public health issue on our financial condition and results of operations
  will depend on the duration and scope of an outbreak (including any potential future waves, the emergence or re-emergence
  of variants and their transmissibility, and the success of vaccination programs and treatments), its impact on our customers,
  dealers, and suppliers, how quickly normal economic conditions, operations, and the demand for our products can resume,
  and any permanent behavioral changes that the pandemic may cause. For example, the duration of a suspension of
  manufacturing operations and a return to our full production schedule will depend, in part, on not only a sufficient number of
  employees being able to return to work but also whether our suppliers and dealers have resumed normal operations. Our
  Ford Blue, Ford Model e, and Ford Pro operations generally do not realize revenue while our manufacturing operations are
  suspended, but we continue to incur operating and non-operating expenses, resulting in a deterioration of our cash flow.
  Accordingly, any significant future disruption to our production schedule, regionally or globally, whether as a result of our own
  or a supplier’s suspension of operations, could have a substantial adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity, and
  results of operations. Moreover, our supply and distribution chains may be disrupted by supplier or dealer bankruptcies or
  their permanent discontinuation of operations triggered by a shutdown of operations due to a widespread public health issue
  or for other reasons.



                                                                    16

26/04/23, 09:00                                                            f-20221231
  Item 1A. Risk Factors (Continued)


       Public health issues may also exacerbate other risks disclosed in our 2022 Form 10-K Report, including, but not limited
  to, our competitiveness, demand or market acceptance for our products and services, and shifting consumer preferences,
  and our ability to successfully execute our strategy.

      Ford is highly dependent on its suppliers to deliver components in accordance with Ford’s production schedule
  and specifications, and a shortage of or inability to acquire key components, such as semiconductors, or raw
  materials, such as lithium, cobalt, nickel, graphite, and manganese, can disrupt Ford’s production of vehicles. Our
  products contain components that we source globally from suppliers who, in turn, source components from their suppliers. If
  there is a shortage of a key component in our supply chain or a supplier is unable to deliver a component to us in
  accordance with our specifications, because of a production issue, limited availability of materials, shipping problems,
  restrictions on transactions with certain countries or companies, or other reason, and the component cannot be easily
  sourced from a different supplier, or we are unable to obtain a component on a timely basis, the shortage may disrupt our
  operations or increase our costs of production. For example, the automotive industry continues to face a significant shortage
  of semiconductors, which has a complex supply chain with long lead times required to increase production and capacity. The
  shortage is due in large part to strong cross-industry demand, which has presented challenges and production disruptions
  globally, including at our assembly plants, and COVID-19-related work restrictions in various parts of the world have further
  impacted semiconductor production. Accordingly, we and our competitors who need integrated circuits are experiencing
  various levels of semiconductor impact.

        For the production of our electric vehicles, we are dependent on the supply of batteries and the raw materials (e.g.,
  lithium, cobalt, nickel, graphite, and manganese) used by our suppliers to produce those batteries. As we increase our
  production of electric vehicles, we expect our need for such materials to increase significantly. At the same time, other
  companies are increasing their production of electric vehicles, which will further increase the demand for such raw materials.
  As a result, we may be unable to acquire raw materials needed for electric vehicle production in sufficient amounts that are
  responsibly sourced or at reasonable prices. As described below under “To facilitate access to the raw materials necessary
  for the production of electric vehicles, Ford has entered into, and expects to continue to enter into, multi-year commitments
  to raw material suppliers that subject Ford to risks associated with lower future demand for such materials as well as costs
  that fluctuate and are difficult to accurately forecast” as well as in the Liquidity and Capital Resources section in Item 7
  below, we have entered into, and expect to continue to enter into, offtake agreements and other long-term purchase
  contracts that obligate us, subject to certain conditions such as quality or minimum output, to purchase a certain percentage
  or minimum amount of output from certain raw materials suppliers. In the event the supplier under those agreements or any
  of our or our suppliers’ raw material supply contracts is unable to deliver sufficient quantities of raw materials needed for our
  or our suppliers’ production operations, e.g., if a mine does not produce at expected levels, or the raw materials do not
  otherwise satisfy our requirements, and we or our suppliers are unable to find an alternative resource with sufficient
  quantities, at reasonable prices, responsibly sourced, and in a timely manner, it could impact our ability to produce electric
  vehicles.

      A shortage of, or our inability to acquire or find adequate suppliers of, key components or raw materials as a result of
  disruptions in the supply chain, capacity constraints, limited availability, competition for those items within the automotive
  industry and other sectors, or otherwise can cause a significant disruption to our production schedule and have a substantial
  adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.

      To facilitate access to the raw materials necessary for the production of electric vehicles, Ford has entered into,
  and expects to continue to enter into, multi-year commitments to raw material suppliers that subject Ford to risks
  associated with lower future demand for such materials as well as costs that fluctuate and are difficult to accurately
  forecast. We have announced plans to significantly increase our electric vehicle production volumes; however, our ability to
  produce higher volumes of electric vehicles is dependent upon the availability of raw materials necessary for the production
  of batteries, e.g., lithium, cobalt, nickel, graphite, and manganese, among others. As described above under “Ford is highly
  dependent on its suppliers to deliver components in accordance with Ford’s production schedule and specifications, and a
  shortage of or inability to acquire key components, such as semiconductors, or raw materials, such as lithium, cobalt, nickel,
  graphite, and manganese, can disrupt Ford’s production of vehicles,” to facilitate our access to such raw materials, we have
  entered into, and expect to continue to enter into, offtake agreements and other long-term purchase contracts. Such
  agreements obligate us, subject to certain conditions such as quality or minimum output, to purchase a certain percentage or
  minimum amount of output from raw material suppliers over an agreed upon period of time pursuant to an agreed upon
  purchase price mechanism that is typically based upon the market price of the material at the time of delivery.

26/04/23, 09:00                                                            f-20221231
  Item 1A. Risk Factors (Continued)


       Unlike our historical arrangements with suppliers, which are typically annual commitments, under multi-year offtake
  agreements and other long-term purchase contracts, the risks associated with lower-than-expected electric vehicle
  production volumes or changes in battery technology that reduce the need for certain raw materials are borne by Ford rather
  than our suppliers. In the event we do not purchase the materials pursuant to the terms of these agreements, even if the
  supplier finds another purchaser, we may be obligated to reimburse the supplier for costs it incurs in finding the new
  purchaser as well as any lost revenue attributable to the replacement purchaser paying a lower price than required under the
  pricing mechanism in our agreement.

       As a result of the competition for and limited availability of the raw materials needed for our electric vehicle business, the
  costs of such materials are difficult to accurately forecast as they may fluctuate during the term of the offtake agreements
  and other long-term purchase contracts based on market conditions. Accordingly, we may be subject to increases in the
  prices we pay for those raw materials, and our ability to recoup such costs through increased pricing to our customers may
  be limited. As a result, our margins, results of operations, financial condition, and reputation may be adversely impacted by
  commitments we make pursuant to offtake agreements and other long-term purchase contracts.

       Ford’s long-term competitiveness depends on the successful execution of Ford+. We previously announced our
  plan for growth and value creation – Ford+. Ford+ is focused on delivering distinctive and increasingly electric products plus
  “Always-On” customer relationships and user experiences. Our Ford+ plan is designed to leverage our foundational
  strengths to build new capabilities – enriching customer experiences and deepening loyalty. As we undertake this
  transformation of our business, we must integrate our strategic initiatives into a cohesive business model, and balance
  competing priorities, or we will not be successful. To facilitate this transformation, we are making substantial investments,
  recruiting new talent, and optimizing our business model, management system, and organization. Accordingly, maintaining
  discipline in our capital allocation continues to be important, as a strong core business and a balance sheet that provides the
  flexibility to invest in these new growth opportunities is critical to the success of our Ford+ plan. If we are unable to optimize
  our capital allocation among vehicles, services, technology, and other calls on capital, or we are otherwise not successful in
  executing Ford+ (or are delayed for reasons outside of our control), we may not be able to realize the full benefits of our
  plan, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Furthermore, if we fail to make
  progress on our plan at the pace that shareholders expect, it may lead to an increase in shareholder activism, which may
  disrupt the conduct of our business and divert management’s attention and resources.

       Ford’s vehicles could be affected by defects that result in delays in new model launches, recall campaigns, or
  increased warranty costs. Government safety standards require manufacturers to remedy defects related to vehicle safety
  through safety recall campaigns, and a manufacturer is obligated to recall vehicles if it determines that the vehicles do not
  comply with a safety standard. We may also be obligated to remedy defects or potentially recall our vehicles due to defective
  components provided to us by our suppliers, arising from their quality issues or otherwise. NHTSA’s enforcement strategy
  has resulted in significant civil penalties being levied and the use of consent orders requiring direct oversight by NHTSA of
  certain manufacturers’ safety processes, a trend that could continue. Should we or government safety regulators determine
  that a safety or other defect or a noncompliance exists with respect to certain of our vehicles prior to the start of production,
  the launch of such vehicle could be delayed until such defect is remedied. The cost of recall and customer satisfaction
  actions to remedy defects in vehicles that have been sold could be substantial, particularly if the actions relate to global
  platforms or involve defects that are identified years after production. For example, NHTSA and the automotive industry are
  currently engaged in a study of the safety of approximately 56 million Takata desiccated airbag inflators in the United States.
  Of these, approximately three and a half million of the inflators are in our vehicles. Should NHTSA determine that the
  inflators contain a safety defect, Ford and other manufacturers could potentially face significant incremental recall costs.
  Further, to the extent recall and customer satisfaction actions relate to defective components we receive from suppliers, our
  ability to recover from the suppliers may be limited by the suppliers’ financial condition. We accrue the estimated cost of both
  base warranty coverages and field service actions at the time a vehicle is sold, and we reevaluate the adequacy of our
  accruals on a regular basis. In addition, from time to time, we issue extended warranties at our expense, the estimated cost
  of which is accrued at the time of issuance. For additional information regarding warranty and field service action costs,
  including our process for establishing our reserves, see “Critical Accounting Estimates” in Item 7 and Note 25 of the Notes to
  the Financial Statements. If warranty costs are greater than anticipated as a result of increased vehicle and component
  complexity, the adoption of new technologies, or otherwise, such costs could have an adverse effect on our financial
  condition or results of operations. Furthermore, launch delays, recall actions, and increased warranty costs could adversely
  affect our reputation or market acceptance of our products as discussed below under “Ford’s new and existing products and
  digital, software, and physical services are subject to market acceptance and face significant competition from existing and
  new entrants in the automotive and digital and software services industries, and its reputation may be harmed if it is unable
  to achieve the initiatives it has announced.”

  Item 1A. Risk Factors (Continued)


       Ford may not realize the anticipated benefits of existing or pending strategic alliances, joint ventures,
  acquisitions, divestitures, restructurings, or new business strategies. We have invested in, formed strategic alliances
  with, and announced or formed joint ventures with a number of companies, and we may expand those relationships or enter
  into similar relationships with additional companies. These initiatives typically involve enormous complexity, may require a
  significant amount of capital, and may involve a lengthy regulatory approval process. As a result, we may not be able to
  complete anticipated transactions, the anticipated benefits of these transactions may not be realized, or the benefits may be
  delayed. For example, we may not successfully integrate an alliance or joint venture with our operations, including the
  implementation of our controls, systems, procedures, and policies, or unforeseen expenses or liabilities may arise that were
  not discovered during due diligence prior to an investment or entry into a strategic alliance, or a misalignment of interests
  may develop between us and the other party. Further, to the extent we share ownership, control, or management with
  another party in a joint venture, our ability to influence the joint venture may be limited, and we may be unable to prevent
  misconduct or implement our compliance or internal control systems. In order to secure critical materials for production of
  electric vehicles, we have entered into and plan to continue to enter into offtake agreements and other long-term purchase
  contracts with raw materials suppliers and make investments in certain raw material and battery suppliers; however, we may
  not realize the anticipated benefits of these actions and our efforts to have such suppliers, particularly those in less
  developed markets, adopt Ford’s sustainability and other standards may be unsuccessful, which could have an adverse
  impact on our reputation. In addition, a restructuring or the implementation of a new or different business strategy may lead
  to the disruption of our existing business operations, including distracting management from current operations. Results of
  operations from new activities may be lower than our existing activities, and, if a strategy is unsuccessful, we may not recoup
  our investments, which may be significant, in that strategy. Moreover, we may continue to have financial exposure following a
  strategic divestiture or cessation of operations in a market, and restructuring actions may cause us to incur significant costs,
  record impairments or other charges, subject us to potential claims from employees, suppliers, dealers, or governmental
  authorities or harm our reputation. Failure to successfully and timely realize the anticipated benefits of the transactions or
  strategies described herein could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.

       Operational systems, security systems, vehicles, and services could be affected by cyber incidents,
  ransomware attacks, and other disruptions and impact Ford and Ford Credit as well as their suppliers and dealers.
  We rely on information technology networks and systems, including in-vehicle systems and mobile devices, some of which
  are managed by suppliers, to process, transmit, and store electronic information that is important to the operation of our
  business, our vehicles, and the services we offer. Despite security measures, we are at risk for interruptions, outages, and
  compromises of: (i) operational systems (including business, financial, accounting, product development, consumer
  receivables, data processing, or manufacturing processes); (ii) facility security systems; and/or (iii) in-vehicle systems or
  mobile devices, whether caused by a ransomware or other cyber attack, security breach, or other reasons, e.g., a natural
  disaster, fire, acts of terrorism or war, or an overburdened infrastructure system. Such incidents could materially disrupt
  operational systems; result in loss of trade secrets or other proprietary or competitively sensitive information; compromise
  the privacy of personal information of consumers, employees, or others; jeopardize the security of our facilities; affect the
  performance of in-vehicle systems or services we offer; and/or impact the safety of our vehicles. This risk exposure rises as
  we continue to develop and produce vehicles with increased connectivity. Moreover, we, our suppliers, and our dealers have
  been the target of cyber attacks in the past, and such attacks will continue and evolve in the future, which may cause cyber
  incidents to be more difficult to detect for periods of time. Our networks and in-vehicle systems, sharing similar architectures,
  could also be impacted by, or a data breach may result from, the negligence or misconduct of insiders or third parties who
  have access to our networks and systems. We continually employ capabilities, processes, and other security measures
  designed to reduce and mitigate the risk of cyber attacks, and we rely on our suppliers to do the same for their operations;
  however, we may not be aware of all vulnerabilities and such preventative measures cannot provide absolute security and
  may not be sufficient in all circumstances or mitigate all potential risks, including potential production disruption. Moreover, a
  cyber incident could harm our reputation, cause customers to lose trust in our security measures, and/or subject us to
  regulatory actions or litigation, which may result in fines, penalties, judgments, or injunctions, and a cyber incident involving
  us or one of our suppliers could impact production, our internal operations, or our ability to deliver products and services to
  our customers.

  Item 1A. Risk Factors (Continued)


        Ford’s production, as well as Ford’s suppliers’ production, and/or the ability to deliver products to consumers
  could be disrupted by labor issues, natural or man-made disasters, adverse effects of climate change, financial
  distress, production difficulties, capacity limitations, or other factors. A work stoppage or other limitation on production
  could occur at Ford’s facilities, at a facility in its supply chain, or at one of its logistics providers for any number of reasons,
  including as a result of labor issues, including shortages of available employees, disputes under existing collective
  bargaining agreements with labor unions or in connection with negotiation of new collective bargaining agreements,
  absenteeism, public health issues (e.g., COVID-19), stay-at-home orders, or in response to potential restructuring actions
  (e.g., plant closures); as a result of supplier financial distress or other production constraints, such as limited quantities of
  components, including but not limited to semiconductors, or raw materials, quality issues, capacity limitations, or other
  difficulties; as a result of a natural disaster (including climate-related physical risk); cyber incidents; or for other reasons.
  Further, the limited availability of components, labor shortages, COVID-19, and supplier operating issues has led to an
  inconsistent production schedule at our facilities. This has exacerbated the disruption to our suppliers’ operations, which, in
  turn, has led to higher costs and production shortfalls.

       Given the worldwide scope of our supply chain and operations, we and our suppliers face a risk of disruption or
  operating inefficiencies that may increase costs due to the adverse physical effects of climate change, which are predicted to
  increase the frequency and severity of weather and other natural events, e.g., wildfires, extended droughts, and extreme
  temperatures. In addition, in the event a weather-related event, strike, international conflict, or other occurrence limits the
  ability of freight carriers to deliver components and other materials from suppliers to us or logistics providers to transport our
  vehicles for an extended period of time, it may increase our costs and delay or otherwise impact both our production
  operations and customers’ ability to receive our vehicles.

      Many components used in our vehicles are available only from a single or limited number of suppliers and, therefore,
  cannot be re-sourced quickly or inexpensively to another supplier (due to long lead times, new contractual commitments that
  may be required by another supplier before ramping up to provide the components or materials, etc.). Such suppliers also
  could threaten to disrupt our production as leverage in negotiations. In addition, when we undertake a model changeover,
  significant downtime at one or more of our production facilities may be required, and our ability to return to full production
  may be delayed if we experience production difficulties at one of our facilities or a supplier’s facility. Moreover, as vehicles,
  components, and their integration become more complex, we may face an increased risk of a delay in production of new
  vehicles. Regardless of the cause, our ability to recoup lost production volume may be limited. Accordingly, a significant
  disruption to our production schedule could have a substantial adverse effect on our financial condition or results of
  operations and may impact our strategy to comply with fuel economy standards as discussed below under “Ford may need
  to substantially modify its product plans and facilities to comply with safety, emissions, fuel economy, autonomous driving
  technology, environmental, and other regulations.”

      Ford’s ability to maintain a competitive cost structure could be affected by labor or other constraints. The vast
  majority of the hourly employees in our Ford Blue and Ford Model e manufacturing operations in the United States and
  Canada are represented by unions and covered by collective bargaining agreements. These agreements provide
  guaranteed wage and benefit levels throughout the contract term and some degree of income security, subject to certain
  conditions. These agreements may restrict our ability to close plants and divest businesses. A substantial number of our
  employees in other regions are represented by unions or government councils, and legislation or custom promoting retention
  of manufacturing or other employment in the state, country, or region may constrain as a practical matter our ability to sell or
  close manufacturing or other facilities.

       Ford’s ability to attract and retain talented, diverse, and highly skilled employees is critical to its success and
  competitiveness. Our success depends on our ability to continue to recruit and retain talented and diverse employees who
  are highly skilled in engineering, software, technology (including digital capabilities and connectivity), marketing, and finance,
  among other areas. Competition for such employees is intense, which has led to an increase in compensation throughout a
  tight labor market, and, accordingly, may increase costs for employers. We have struggled to hire and retain salaried, skilled
  hourly, and production hourly employees in some of our manufacturing and parts, supplies, and logistics locations. In
  addition to compensation considerations, current and potential employees are increasingly placing a premium on various
  intangibles, such as working for companies with a clear purpose and strong brand reputation, flexible work arrangements,
  and other considerations, such as embracing sustainability and diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives. If we are not
  perceived as an employer of choice, we may be unable to recruit highly skilled employees. Further, if we lose existing
  employees with needed skills, or we are unable to upskill and develop existing employees, particularly with the introduction
  of new technologies, it could have a substantial adverse effect on our business.

  Item 1A. Risk Factors (Continued)


  Macroeconomic, Market, and Strategic Risks

       Ford’s new and existing products and digital, software, and physical services are subject to market acceptance
  and face significant competition from existing and new entrants in the automotive and digital and software services
  industries, and its reputation may be harmed if it is unable to achieve the initiatives it has announced. Although we
  conduct extensive market research before launching new or refreshed vehicles and introducing new services, many factors
  both within and outside our control affect the success of new or existing products and services in the marketplace, and we
  may not be able to accurately predict or identify emerging trends or preferences or the success of new products or services
  in the market. It takes years to design and develop a new vehicle or change an existing vehicle. Because customers’
  preferences may change quickly, our new and existing products may not generate sales in sufficient quantities and at costs
  low enough to be profitable and recoup investment costs. Offering vehicles and services that customers want and value can
  mitigate the risks of increasing price competition and declining demand, but products and services that are perceived to be
  less desirable (whether in terms of price, quality, styling, safety, overall value, fuel efficiency, or other attributes) can
  exacerbate these risks. For example, if we are unable to differentiate our products and services from those of our
  competitors, develop innovative new products and services, or sufficiently tailor our products and services to customers in
  other markets, there could be insufficient demand for our products and services, which could have an adverse impact on our
  financial condition or results of operations.

       With increased consumer interconnectedness through the internet, social media, and other media, mere allegations
  relating to quality, safety, fuel efficiency, sustainability, corporate social responsibility, or other key attributes can negatively
  impact our reputation or market acceptance of our products or services, even where such allegations prove to be inaccurate
  or unfounded. Further, our ability to successfully grow through capacity expansion and investments in the areas of
  electrification, connectivity, digital and physical services, and software services depends on many factors, including
  advancements in technology, regulatory changes, infrastructure development (e.g., a widespread vehicle charging network),
  and other factors that are difficult to predict, that may significantly affect the future of electric and autonomous vehicles,
  digital and physical services, and software services. The automotive, software, and digital service businesses are very
  competitive and are undergoing rapid changes. Traditional competitors are expanding their offerings, and new types of
  competitors (particularly in our areas of strength, e.g., pick-up trucks, utilities, and commercial vehicles) that may possess
  superior technology, may have business models with certain aspects that are more efficient, and are not subject to the same
  level of fixed costs as us, are entering the market. This level of competition increases the importance of our ability to
  anticipate, develop, and deliver products and services that customers desire on a timely basis, in quantities in line with
  demand, and at costs low enough to be profitable.

      We have announced our intent to continue making multi-billion dollar investments in electrification and software services.
  Our plans include offering electrified versions of many of our vehicles, including the F-150 Lightning and E-Transit. If the
  market for electrified vehicles does not develop at the rate we expect, even if the regulatory framework encourages a rapid
  adoption of electrified vehicles, there is a negative perception of our vehicles or about electric vehicles in general, or if
  consumers prefer our competitors’ vehicles, there could be an adverse impact on our financial condition or results of
  operations. Further, as discussed below under “Ford may need to substantially modify its product plans and facilities to
  comply with safety, emissions, fuel economy, autonomous driving technology, environmental, and other regulations,” lower
  than planned market acceptance of our vehicles may impact our strategy to comply with fuel economy standards.

        Ford is addressing its impact on climate change aligned with the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate
  Change (Paris Agreement) by working to reduce our carbon footprint over time across our vehicles, operations, and supply
  chain. We have announced interim emissions targets approved by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) and made
  other statements about similar initiatives, e.g., our expected electric vehicle volumes in future years. Achievement of these
  initiatives will require significant investments and the implementation of new processes; however, there is no assurance that
  the desired outcomes will be achieved. To the extent we are unable to achieve these initiatives or our transition to
  electrification is slower than expected, it may harm our reputation or we may not otherwise receive the expected return on
  the investment. For example, we are exposed to reputational risk if we do not reduce vehicle CO2 emissions in line with our
  targets or in compliance with applicable regulations. Further, our customers and investors evaluate how well we are
  progressing on our announced climate goals and aspirations, and if we are not on track to achieve those goals and
  aspirations on a timely basis, or if the expectations of our customers and investors change and we do not adequately
  address their expectations, our reputation could be impacted, and customers may choose to purchase the products and
  services of, investors may choose to invest in, and suppliers and vendors may choose to do business with other companies.




                                                                    21

26/04/23, 09:00                                                            f-20221231
  Item 1A. Risk Factors (Continued)


      Moreover, new offerings, including those related to electric vehicles and autonomous driving technologies, may present
  technological challenges that could be costly to implement and overcome and may subject us to customer claims if they do
  not operate as anticipated. In addition, since new technologies are subject to market acceptance, a malfunction involving any
  manufacturer’s autonomous vehicle may negatively impact the perception of autonomous vehicles and erode customer trust.

        Ford’s results are dependent on sales of larger, more profitable vehicles, particularly in the United States. A shift
  in consumer preferences away from larger, more profitable vehicles with internal combustion engines (including trucks and
  utilities) to electric or other vehicles in our portfolio that may be less profitable could result in an adverse effect on our
  financial condition or results of operations. If demand for electric vehicles grows at a rate greater than our ability to increase
  our production capacity for those vehicles, lower market share and revenue, as well as facility and other asset-related
  charges (e.g., accelerated depreciation) associated with the production of internal combustion vehicles, may result. In
  addition, government regulations aimed at reducing emissions and increasing fuel efficiency (e.g., ZEV mandates and low
  emission zones) and other factors that accelerate the transition to electric vehicles may increase the cost of vehicles by more
  than the perceived benefit to consumers and dampen margins.

       With a global footprint, Ford’s results could be adversely affected by economic or geopolitical developments,
  including protectionist trade policies such as tariffs, or other events. Because of the interconnectedness of the global
  economy, the challenges of a pandemic, a financial crisis, economic downturn or recession, natural disaster, war, geopolitical
  crises, or other significant events in one area of the world can have an immediate and material adverse impact on markets
  around the world. Changes in international trade policy can also have a substantial adverse effect on our financial condition
  or results of operations. Steps taken by governments to apply or consider applying tariffs on automobiles, parts, and other
  products and materials have the potential to disrupt existing supply chains, impose additional costs on our business, and
  may lead to other countries attempting to retaliate by imposing tariffs, which would make our products more expensive for
  customers, and, in turn, could make our products less competitive. In particular, China presents unique risks to U.S.
  automakers due to the strain in U.S.-China relations, China’s unique regulatory landscape, and the level of integration with
  key components in our global supply chain.

      Ford has operations in various markets with volatile economic or political environments. This may expose us to
  heightened risks as a result of economic, geopolitical, or other events, including governmental takeover (i.e., nationalization)
  of our manufacturing facilities or intellectual property, restrictive exchange or import controls, disruption of operations as a
  result of systemic political or economic instability, outbreak of war or expansion of hostilities (such as the actions taken by
  Russia in Ukraine), and acts of terrorism, each of which could impact our supply chain as well as our operations and have a
  substantial adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Further, the U.S. government, other
  governments, and international organizations could impose additional sanctions or export controls that could restrict us from
  doing business directly or indirectly in or with certain countries or parties, which could include affiliates.

      Industry sales volume can be volatile and could decline if there is a financial crisis, recession, or significant
  geopolitical event. Because we, like other manufacturers, have a higher proportion of fixed structural costs, relatively small
  changes in industry sales volume can have a substantial effect on our cash flow and results of operations. Vehicle sales are
  affected by overall economic and market conditions and developing trends such as shared vehicle ownership and the
  transportation as a service model, e.g., ridesharing services. If industry vehicle sales were to decline to levels significantly
  below our planning assumption, the decline could have a substantial adverse effect on our financial condition, results of
  operations, and cash flow. For a discussion of economic trends, see Item 7.

       Ford may face increased price competition or a reduction in demand for its products resulting from industry
  excess capacity, currency fluctuations, competitive actions, or other factors. The global automotive industry is
  intensely competitive, with installed manufacturing capacity generally exceeding current demand. Historically, industry
  overcapacity has resulted in many manufacturers offering marketing incentives on vehicles in an attempt to maintain and
  grow market share; these incentives historically have included a combination of subsidized financing or leasing programs,
  price rebates, and other incentives. As a result, we are not necessarily able to set our prices to offset higher marketing
  incentives, commodity or other cost increases, tariffs, or the impact of adverse currency fluctuations. This risk includes cost
  advantages foreign competitors may have because of their weaker home market currencies, which may, in turn, enable
  those competitors to offer their products at lower prices. Further, higher inventory levels put downward pressure on pricing,
  which may have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. As the automotive industry transitions
  to electric vehicles, excess capacity, particularly for internal combustion engine trucks and utilities, may continue or increase.
  This excess capacity may further increase price competition in that segment of the market, which could have a substantial
  adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.

  Item 1A. Risk Factors (Continued)


       Inflationary pressure and fluctuations in commodity and energy prices, foreign currency exchange rates,
  interest rates, and market value of Ford or Ford Credit’s investments, including marketable securities, can have a
  significant effect on results. We and our suppliers are exposed to inflationary pressure and a variety of market risks,
  including the effects of changes in commodity and energy prices, foreign currency exchange rates, and interest rates. We
  monitor and manage these exposures as an integral part of our overall risk management program, which recognizes the
  unpredictability of markets and seeks to reduce potentially adverse effects on our business. Changes in commodity and
  energy prices (from tariffs and the actions taken by Russia in Ukraine, as discussed above under “With a global footprint,
  Ford’s results could be adversely affected by economic or geopolitical developments, including protectionist trade policies
  such as tariffs, or other events,” or otherwise), currency exchange rates, and interest rates cannot always be predicted,
  hedged, or offset with price increases to eliminate earnings volatility. As a result, significant changes in commodity and
  energy prices, foreign currency exchange rates, or interest rates as well as increased material, freight, logistics, and similar
  costs could have a substantial adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. See Item 7 and Item 7A for
  additional discussion of currency, commodity and energy price, and interest rate risks. For example, interest rates have
  increased significantly as central banks in developed countries attempt to subdue inflation while government deficits and
  debt remain at high levels in many global markets. Accordingly, the eventual implications of higher government deficits and
  debt, tighter monetary policy, and potentially higher long-term interest rates may drive a higher cost of capital for the
  business. At Ford Credit, rising interest rates may impact Ford Credit’s ability to source funding and offer financing at
  competitive rates, which could reduce its financing margin. In addition, our results are impacted by fluctuations in the market
  value of our investments, with unrealized gains and losses that could be material in any period.

  Financial Risks

      Ford and Ford Credit’s access to debt, securitization, or derivative markets around the world at competitive
  rates or in sufficient amounts could be affected by credit rating downgrades, market volatility, market disruption,
  regulatory requirements, or other factors. Ford and Ford Credit’s ability to obtain unsecured funding at a reasonable cost
  is dependent on their credit ratings or their perceived creditworthiness. Further, Ford Credit’s ability to obtain securitized
  funding under its committed asset-backed liquidity programs and certain other asset-backed securitization transactions is
  subject to having a sufficient amount of assets eligible for these programs, as well as Ford Credit’s ability to obtain
  appropriate credit ratings and, for certain committed programs, derivatives to manage the interest rate risk. Over time, and
  particularly in the event of credit rating downgrades, market volatility, market disruption, or other factors, Ford Credit may
  reduce the amount of receivables it purchases or originates because of funding constraints. In addition, Ford Credit may
  reduce the amount of receivables it purchases or originates if there is a significant decline in the demand for the types of
  securities it offers or Ford Credit is unable to obtain derivatives to manage the interest rate risk associated with its
  securitization transactions. A significant reduction in the amount of receivables Ford Credit purchases or originates would
  significantly reduce its ongoing results of operations and could adversely affect its ability to support the sale of Ford vehicles.

      Furthermore, in addition to rising interest rates adversely affecting overall economic activity and the financial condition of
  our customers, increases in interest rates could cause credit market disruptions, which have historically resulted in higher
  borrower costs and made it more difficult to access the markets, obtain financing on favorable terms, and fund our
  operations.

      The impact of government incentives on Ford’s business could be significant, and Ford’s receipt of government
  incentives could be subject to reduction, termination, or clawback. We receive economic benefits from national, state,
  and local governments in various regions of the world in the form of incentives designed to encourage manufacturers to
  establish, maintain, or increase investment, workforce, or production. These incentives may take various forms, including
  grants, loan subsidies, or tax abatements or credits. The impact of these incentives can be significant in a particular market
  during a reporting period. A decrease in, expiration without renewal of, or other cessation or clawback of government
  incentives for any of our business units, as a result of administrative decision or otherwise, could have a substantial adverse
  impact on our financial condition or results of operations. Until 2021, most of our manufacturing facilities in South America
  were located in Brazil, where the state or federal governments historically offered significant incentives to manufacturers to
  encourage capital investment, increase manufacturing production, and create jobs. As a result, the performance of our South
  American operations had been impacted favorably by government incentives to a substantial extent. The federal government
  in Brazil has levied assessments against us concerning the federal incentives we previously received, and the State of São
  Paulo has challenged the grant to us of tax incentives by the State of Bahia. See Note 2 of the Notes to the Financial
  Statements for discussion of our accounting for government incentives, and “Item 3. Legal Proceedings” for a discussion of
  tax proceedings in Brazil and the potential requirement for us to post collateral.

  Item 1A. Risk Factors (Continued)


      The U.S. Inflation Reduction Act (“IRA”) provides, among other things, financial incentives in the form of tax credits to
  grow the domestic supply chain and domestic manufacturing base for electric vehicles, plug-in hybrid vehicles (PHEVs), and
  other “clean” vehicles. The law likewise incentivizes the purchase of clean vehicles and the infrastructure to fuel them. These
  incentives are phasing in and will remain in effect until approximately 2032, unless modified by Congress. The IRA’s
  incentives are having and are expected to have material impacts on the automotive industry and Ford. The IRA authorizes
  tax credits to manufacturers for the domestic production of batteries and battery components for EVs and PHEVs and to
  purchasers of qualified commercial and retail clean vehicles. Ford expects that many customers will be able to monetize the
  commercial clean vehicle credit in light of Ford’s range of electrified product offerings for commercial applications. When
  paired with the IRA’s tax credit for the construction of certain electric vehicle charging infrastructure, Ford expects the
  commercial clean vehicle credit will significantly influence commercial fleets in their evaluation of a transition from internal
  combustion engine vehicles to EVs and PHEVs.

       To claim the retail tax credit, the IRA establishes numerous and complex prerequisites, including that the vehicle must be
  assembled in North America; the vehicle must be under specified limitations on manufacturer suggested retail price
  (“MSRP”); purchaser income limitations; starting in 2024, any vehicle that contains “battery components” that were
  “manufactured or assembled” by a “foreign entity of concern” will be ineligible; and, starting in 2025, any vehicle that contains
  battery materials that were “extracted, processed, or recycled” by a “foreign entity of concern” will be ineligible. A “Critical
  Minerals Credit” is available for those vehicles that have a specified percentage of critical minerals that are “extracted or
  produced” in the United States, in a country with which the United States has a Free Trade Agreement, or that is “recycled” in
  North America. A “Battery Components Credit” is available for those vehicles that have a specified percentage of “value” of
  its battery “components” that are “manufactured or assembled” in North America.

      Although we ultimately expect the IRA to benefit Ford and the automotive industry in general, the availability of such
  benefits will depend on the further development and improvement of the U.S. battery supply, sufficient access to raw
  materials within the scope of the IRA, and the terms of the regulations and guidance (and the limitations therein) the U.S.
  government issues to implement the IRA, which will ultimately determine which vehicles qualify for incentives and the
  amount thereof. For example, in late 2022 interim guidance was released on how to apply the MSRP limitations to the retail
  clean vehicle credit, and subjected a significant number of SUVs to a lower MSRP limitation than the industry expected,
  thereby excluding vehicles that may otherwise be eligible for the credit. Automakers that better optimize eligibility for their
  vehicles, as compared to their competition, will have a competitive advantage.

       Ford Credit could experience higher-than-expected credit losses, lower-than-anticipated residual values, or
  higher-than-expected return volumes for leased vehicles. Credit risk is the possibility of loss from a customer’s or
  dealer’s failure to make payments according to contract terms. Credit risk (which is heavily dependent upon economic
  factors including unemployment, consumer debt service burden, personal income growth, dealer profitability, and used car
  prices) has a significant impact on Ford Credit’s business. The level of credit losses Ford Credit may experience could
  exceed its expectations and adversely affect its financial condition or results of operations. In addition, Ford Credit projects
  expected residual values (including residual value support payments from Ford) and return volumes for the vehicles it
  leases. Actual proceeds realized by Ford Credit upon the sale of returned leased vehicles at lease termination may be lower
  than the amount projected, which would reduce Ford Credit’s return on the lease transaction. Among the factors that can
  affect the value of returned lease vehicles are the volume and mix of vehicles returned industry-wide, economic conditions,
  marketing programs, and quality or perceived quality, safety, fuel efficiency, or reliability of the vehicles, or changes in
  propulsion technology and related legislative changes. Actual return volumes may be influenced by these factors, as well as
  by contractual lease-end values relative to auction values. In 2022, Ford Credit experienced lower-than-expected return
  volumes. If auction values decrease significantly in the future, return volumes could exceed Ford Credit’s expectations. Each
  of these factors, alone or in combination, has the potential to adversely affect Ford Credit’s results of operations if actual
  results were to differ significantly from Ford Credit’s projections. See “Critical Accounting Estimates” in Item 7 for additional
  discussion.

       Economic and demographic experience for pension and OPEB plans (e.g., discount rates or investment returns)
  could be worse than Ford has assumed. The measurement of our obligations, costs, and liabilities associated with
  benefits pursuant to our pension and OPEB plans requires that we estimate the present value of projected future payments
  to all participants. We use many assumptions in calculating these estimates, including assumptions related to discount rates,
  investment returns on designated plan assets, and demographic experience (e.g., mortality and retirement rates). We
  generally remeasure these estimates at each year end and recognize any gains or losses associated with changes to our
  plan assets and liabilities in the year incurred. To the extent actual results are less favorable than our assumptions, we may
  recognize a remeasurement loss in our results, which could be substantial. For additional information regarding our
  assumptions, see “Critical Accounting Estimates” in Item 7 and Note 17 of the Notes to the Financial Statements.



                                                                    24

26/04/23, 09:00                                                            f-20221231
  Item 1A. Risk Factors (Continued)


      Pension and other postretirement liabilities could adversely affect Ford’s liquidity and financial condition. We
  have defined benefit retirement plans in the United States that cover many of our hourly and salaried employees. We also
  provide pension benefits to non-U.S. employees and retirees, primarily in Europe. In addition, we sponsor plans to provide
  OPEB for retired employees (primarily health care and life insurance benefits). See Note 17 of the Notes to the Financial
  Statements for more information about these plans. These benefit plans impose significant liabilities on us and could require
  us to make additional cash contributions, which could impair our liquidity. If our cash flows and capital resources are
  insufficient to meet any pension or OPEB obligations, we could be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital
  expenditures, suspend dividend payments, seek additional capital, or restructure or refinance our indebtedness.

  Legal and Regulatory Risks

       Ford and Ford Credit could experience unusual or significant litigation, governmental investigations, or adverse
  publicity arising out of alleged defects in products, services, perceived environmental impacts, or otherwise. We
  spend substantial resources to comply with governmental safety regulations, mobile and stationary source emissions
  regulations, consumer and automotive financial regulations, and other standards, but we cannot ensure that employees or
  other individuals affiliated with us will not violate such laws or regulations. In addition, as discussed below under “Ford may
  need to substantially modify its product plans and facilities to comply with safety, emissions, fuel economy, autonomous
  driving technology, environmental, and other regulations” and “Ford Credit could be subject to new or increased credit
  regulations, consumer protection regulations, or other regulations,” regulatory standards and interpretations may change on
  short notice and impact our compliance status. Government investigations against Ford or Ford Credit could result in fines,
  penalties, or orders that could have an adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations, or the operation of
  our business. Moreover, compliance with governmental standards does not necessarily prevent individual or class action
  lawsuits, which can entail significant cost and risk. In certain circumstances, courts may permit civil actions even where our
  vehicles, services, and financial products comply with federal and/or other applicable law. Furthermore, simply responding to
  actual or threatened litigation or government investigations of our compliance with regulatory standards, whether related to
  our products, services, or business or commercial relationships, requires significant expenditures of time and other
  resources. Litigation also is inherently uncertain, and we could experience significant adverse results, including
  compensatory and punitive damage awards, a disgorgement of profits or revenue, or injunctive relief, any of which could
  have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or our business in general. In addition, adverse
  publicity surrounding an allegation may cause significant reputational harm that could have a significant adverse effect on
  our sales.

       Ford may need to substantially modify its product plans and facilities to comply with safety, emissions, fuel
  economy, autonomous driving technology, environmental, and other regulations. The automotive industry is subject to
  regulations worldwide that govern product characteristics and that differ by global region, country, and sometimes within
  national boundaries. Further, additional and new regulations continue to be proposed to address concerns regarding the
  environment (including concerns about global climate change and its impact), vehicle safety, and energy independence, and
  the regulatory landscape can change on short notice. These regulations vary, but generally require that over time motor
  vehicles and engines emit less air pollution, including greenhouse gas emissions, oxides of nitrogen, hydrocarbons, carbon
  monoxide, and particulate matter. Similarly, we are making substantial investments in our facilities and revising our
  processes to not only comply with applicable regulations but also to make our operations more efficient and sustainable. As
  our suppliers make similar investments, those higher costs may be passed on to us. In the United States, legal and policy
  debates on environmental regulations are continuing, with a primary trend toward reducing GHG emissions and increasing
  vehicle electrification. Recently, different federal administrations have either sought to make standards more strict or to make
  them less strict, with one administration often replacing the regulations enacted by the last. Various third parties routinely
  seek judicial review of these federal regulatory and deregulatory efforts. In parallel, California continues to enact increasingly
  strict emissions standards and requirements for zero emission vehicles, and those actions are also the subject of legal
  challenges from third parties. Court rulings regarding regulatory actions by federal, California, and other state regulators
  create uncertainty and the potential for applicable regulatory standards to change quickly. In addition, many governments
  regulate local product content and/or impose import requirements with the aim of creating jobs, protecting domestic
  producers, and influencing the balance of payments.




                                                                    25

  Item 1A. Risk Factors (Continued)


      We are continuing to make changes to our product cycle plan to improve the fuel economy of our petroleum-powered
  vehicles and to offer more propulsion choices, such as electrified vehicles, with lower GHG emissions. Electrification is our
  core strategy to comply with current and anticipated environmental laws and regulations in major markets. However, there
  are limits on our ability to reduce emissions and increase fuel economy over a given time frame and many factors are
  involved that could delay or impede our plans, primarily relating to the cost and effectiveness of available technologies,
  consumer acceptance of new technologies and changes in vehicle mix (as described in more detail above under “Ford’s new
  and existing products and digital, software, and physical services are subject to market acceptance and face significant
  competition from existing and new entrants in the automotive and digital and software services industries, and its reputation
  may be harmed if it is unable to achieve the initiatives it has announced”), willingness of consumers to absorb the additional
  costs of new technologies, the appropriateness (or lack thereof) of certain technologies for use in particular vehicles, the
  widespread availability (or lack thereof) of supporting infrastructure for new technologies, including charging for electric
  vehicles, the availability (or lack thereof) of the raw materials and component supply to make batteries and other elements of
  electric vehicles, and the human, engineering, and financial resources necessary to deploy new technologies across a wide
  range of products and powertrains in a short time. If fuel prices are relatively low and market conditions do not drive
  consumers to purchase electric vehicles and other highly fuel-efficient vehicles in large numbers, it may be difficult to meet
  applicable environmental standards without compromising results. Moreover, a production disruption, stop ship, limited
  availability of necessary components, e.g., batteries or the raw materials necessary for their production, lower than planned
  market acceptance of our vehicles, or other intervening events may cause us to modify our product plans, or, in some cases,
  purchase credits, in order to comply with standards regarding fuel economy and air pollution, which could have an adverse
  effect on our financial condition or results of operations and/or cause reputational harm.

       Increased scrutiny of automaker emission compliance by regulators around the world has led to new regulations, more
  stringent enforcement programs, additional field actions, demands for reporting on the field performance of emissions
  components and higher scrutiny of field data, and/or delays in regulatory approvals. The cost to comply with existing
  government regulations (in addition to the cost of any field service actions that may result from regulatory actions) is
  substantial and additional regulations, changes in regulatory interpretations, or changes in consumer preferences that affect
  vehicle mix, as well as a non-compliance with applicable laws and regulations, could have a substantial adverse impact on
  our financial condition or results of operations. In addition, a number of governments, as well as non-governmental
  organizations, publicly assess vehicles to their own protocols. The protocols could change, and any negative perception
  regarding the performance of our vehicles subjected to such tests could reduce future sales. Court decisions arising out of
  consumer and investor litigation could give rise to de facto changes in the interpretation of existing emission laws and
  regulations, thereby imposing new burdens on manufacturers. For more discussion of the impact of standards on our global
  business, see the “Governmental Standards” discussion in “Item 1. Business” above.

      We and other companies continue to develop autonomous vehicle technologies, and the U.S. and foreign governments
  are continuing to develop the regulatory framework that will govern autonomous vehicles. The evolution of the regulatory
  framework for autonomous vehicles, and the pace of the development of such regulatory framework, may subject us to
  increased costs and uncertainty, and may ultimately impact our ability to deliver autonomous vehicles and related services
  that customers want.

       Ford and Ford Credit could be affected by the continued development of more stringent privacy, data use, and
  data protection laws and regulations as well as consumers’ heightened expectations to safeguard their personal
  information. We are subject to laws, rules, guidelines from privacy regulators, and regulations in the United States and
  other countries (such as the European Union’s and the U.K.’s General Data Protection Regulations and the California
  Consumer Privacy Act) relating to the collection, use, cross-border data transfer, and security of personal information of
  consumers, employees, or others, including laws that may require us to notify regulators and affected individuals of a data
  security incident. Existing and newly developed laws and regulations may contain broad definitions of personal information,
  are subject to change and uncertain interpretations by courts and regulators, and may be inconsistent from state to state or
  country to country. Accordingly, complying with such laws and regulations may lead to a decline in consumer engagement or
  cause us to incur substantial costs to modify our operations or business practices. Moreover, regulatory actions seeking to
  impose significant financial penalties for noncompliance and/or legal actions (including pursuant to laws providing for private
  rights of action by consumers) could be brought against us in the event of a data compromise, misuse of consumer
  information, or perceived or actual non-compliance with data protection or privacy requirements. Further, any unauthorized
  release of personal information could harm our reputation, disrupt our business, cause us to expend significant resources,
  and lead to a loss of consumer confidence resulting in an adverse impact on our business and/or consumers deciding to
  withhold or withdraw consent for our collection or use of data.

  Item 1A. Risk Factors (Continued)


      Ford Credit could be subject to new or increased credit regulations, consumer protection regulations, or other
  regulations. As a finance company, Ford Credit is highly regulated by governmental authorities in the locations in which it
  operates, which can impose significant additional costs and/or restrictions on its business. In the United States, for example,
  Ford Credit’s operations are subject to regulation and supervision under various federal, state, and local laws, including the
  federal Truth-in-Lending Act, Consumer Leasing Act, Equal Credit Opportunity Act, and Fair Credit Reporting Act.

      The Dodd-Frank Act directs federal agencies to adopt rules to regulate the finance industry and the capital markets and
  gives the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”) broad rule-making and enforcement authority for a wide range of
  consumer financial protection laws that regulate consumer finance businesses, such as Ford Credit’s automotive financing
  business. Exercise of these powers by the CFPB may increase the costs of, impose additional restrictions on, or otherwise
  adversely affect companies in the automotive finance business. The CFPB has authority to supervise and examine the
  largest nonbank automotive finance companies, such as Ford Credit, for compliance with consumer financial protection laws.

       Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could subject Ford Credit to regulatory enforcement actions,
  including consent orders or similar orders where Ford Credit may be required to revise practices, remunerate customers, or
  pay fines. An enforcement action against Ford Credit could harm Ford Credit’s reputation or lead to further litigation.

  ITEM 2. Properties.

     Our principal properties include manufacturing and assembly facilities, distribution centers, warehouses, sales or
  administrative offices, and engineering centers.

       We own substantially all of our U.S. manufacturing and assembly facilities. Our facilities are situated in various sections
  of the country and include assembly plants, engine plants, casting plants, metal stamping plants, transmission plants, and
  other component plants. Most of our distribution centers are leased (we own approximately 35% of the total square footage,
  and lease the balance). The majority of the warehouses that we operate are leased, although many of our manufacturing
  and assembly facilities contain some warehousing space. Substantially all of our sales offices are leased space.
  Approximately 85% of the total square footage of our testing, prototype, and operations space is owned by us.

       In addition, we maintain and operate manufacturing plants, assembly facilities, parts distribution centers, and
  engineering centers outside of the United States. We own substantially all of our non-U.S. manufacturing plants, assembly
  facilities, and engineering centers. The majority of our parts distribution centers outside of the United States are either leased
  or provided by vendors under service contracts.

     We and the entities that we consolidated as of December 31, 2022 use 13 engineering and research facilities and 44
  manufacturing and assembly plants, which includes plants that are operated by us or our consolidated joint venture that
  support our Automotive segment.

      We have one significant consolidated joint venture in our Automotive segment:

      •    Ford Vietnam Limited — a joint venture between Ford (75% partner) and Diesel Song Cong One Member Limited
           Liability Company (a subsidiary of the Vietnam Engine and Agricultural Machinery Corporation, which in turn is
           majority owned (87.43%) by the State of Vietnam represented by the Ministry of Industry and Trade) (25% partner).
           Ford Vietnam Limited assembles and distributes a variety of Ford passenger and commercial vehicle models. The
           joint venture operates one plant in Vietnam.

      In addition to the plants that we operate directly or that are operated by our consolidated joint venture, additional plants
  that support our Automotive segment are operated by unconsolidated joint ventures of which we are a partner. The most
  significant of our Automotive segment unconsolidated joint ventures are as follows:
      • AutoAlliance (Thailand) Co., Ltd. (“AAT”) — a 50/50 joint venture between Ford and Mazda that owns and operates
           a manufacturing plant in Rayong, Thailand. AAT produces Ford and Mazda products for domestic and export sales.

      •    BlueOval SK, LLC — a 50/50 joint venture among Ford, SK On Co., Ltd., and SK Battery America, Inc. (a wholly
           owned subsidiary of SK On) that will build and operate electric vehicle battery plants in Tennessee and Kentucky to
           supply batteries to Ford and Ford affiliates.

      •    Changan Ford Automobile Corporation, Ltd. (“CAF”) — a 50/50 joint venture between Ford and Chongqing Changan
           Automobile Co., Ltd. (“Changan”). CAF operates four assembly plants, an engine plant, and a transmission plant in
           China where it produces and distributes a variety of Ford passenger vehicle models.

      •    Ford Lio Ho Motor Company Ltd. (“FLH”) — a joint venture in Taiwan between Ford (26% partner) and local partners
           (74% ownership in aggregate) that assembles a variety of Ford vehicles sourced from Ford. In addition to domestic
           assembly, FLH imports Ford brand built-up vehicles from Asia Pacific, Europe, and the United States. The joint
           venture operates one plant in Taiwan.

      •    Ford Otomotiv Sanayi Anonim Sirketi (“Ford Otosan”) — a joint venture in Türkiye among Ford (41% partner), the
           Koc Group of Türkiye (41% partner), and public investors (18%) that is the sole supplier to us of the Transit, Transit
           Custom, and Transit Courier commercial vehicles, and, as of July 2022, the sole supplier of the Puma and EcoSport
           for Europe and is the sole distributor of Ford vehicles in Türkiye. Ford Otosan also manufactures Ford heavy trucks
           for markets in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. The joint venture owns three plants, a parts distribution depot,
           and a research and development center in Türkiye, and, as of July 2022, a combined vehicle and engine plant in
           Romania.

  Item 2. Properties (Continued)


      •    JMC — a publicly-traded company in China with Ford (32% shareholder) and Nanchang Jiangling Investment Co.,
           Ltd. (41% shareholder) as its controlling shareholders. Nanchang Jiangling Investment Co., Ltd. is a 50/50 joint
           venture between Changan and Jiangling Motors Company Group. The public investors in JMC own 27% of its total
           outstanding shares. JMC assembles Ford Transit, a series of Ford SUVs, Ford engines, and non-Ford vehicles and
           engines for distribution in China and in other export markets. JMC operates two assembly plants and one engine
           plant in Nanchang.

     The facilities described above are, in the opinion of management, suitable and adequate for the manufacture and
  assembly of our and our joint ventures’ products.

      The furniture, equipment, and other physical property owned by our Ford Credit operations are not material in relation to
  the operations’ total assets.

  ITEM 3. Legal Proceedings.

      The litigation process is subject to many uncertainties, and the outcome of individual matters is not predictable with
  assurance. See Note 25 of the Notes to the Financial Statements for a discussion of loss contingencies. Following is a
  discussion of our significant pending legal proceedings:

  PRODUCT LIABILITY MATTERS

      We are a defendant in numerous actions in state and federal courts within and outside of the United States alleging
  damages from injuries resulting from (or aggravated by) alleged defects in our vehicles. In many actions, no monetary
  amount of damages is specified or the specific amount alleged is the jurisdictional minimum. Our experience with litigation
  alleging a specific amount of damages suggests that such amounts, on average, bear little relation to the actual amount of
  damages, if any, that we will pay in resolving such matters.

      In addition to pending actions, we assess the likelihood of incidents that likely have occurred but not yet been reported to
  us. We also take into consideration specific matters that have been raised as claims but have not yet proceeded to litigation.
  Individual product liability matters that have more than a remote risk of loss and such loss would likely be significant if the
  matter is resolved unfavorably to us would be described herein. Currently there are no such matters to report.

      Below is a product liability matter currently pending against Ford:

        Hill v. Ford. Plaintiffs in this product liability action pending in Georgia state court allege that the roof of a 2002 Ford F-
  250 involved in a rollover accident was defectively designed. During the first trial in 2018, the judge declared a mistrial, ruled
  that Ford’s attorneys had violated pre-trial rulings while presenting evidence, and sanctioned Ford by prohibiting Ford from
  introducing any evidence at the second trial to show that the roof design of the F-250 was not defective. During the second
  trial in August 2022, a jury found that Pep Boys (the party that sold the tires on the vehicle involved in the rollover accident)
  was responsible for 30% of the damages, and Ford, as a direct result of the sanctions order prohibiting Ford from presenting
  its defense, was responsible for 70% of the damages, resulting in $16.8 million in damages being apportioned to Ford. The
  jury subsequently awarded punitive damages against Ford in the amount of $1.7 billion. We have filed post-trial motions and
  are seeking a new trial. A hearing on our post-trial motions was held on December 19, 2022, and we believe the law supports
  our position that Ford is entitled to a new trial with the right to present evidence in its defense.




                                                                    29




https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/37996/000003799623000012/f-20221231.htm                                                   33/183
26/04/23, 09:00                                                            f-20221231
  Item 3. Legal Proceedings (Continued)


  ASBESTOS MATTERS

       Asbestos was used in some brakes, clutches, and other automotive components from the early 1900s. Along with other
  vehicle manufacturers, we have been the target of asbestos litigation and, as a result, are a defendant in various actions for
  injuries claimed to have resulted from alleged exposure to Ford parts and other products containing asbestos. Plaintiffs in
  these personal injury cases allege various health problems as a result of asbestos exposure, either from component parts
  found in older vehicles, insulation or other asbestos products in our facilities, or asbestos aboard our former maritime fleet.
  We believe that we are targeted more aggressively in asbestos suits because many previously targeted companies have
  filed for bankruptcy or emerged from bankruptcy relieved of liability for such claims.

      Most of the asbestos litigation we face involves individuals who claim to have worked on the brakes of our vehicles. We
  are prepared to defend these cases and believe that the scientific evidence confirms our long-standing position that there is
  no increased risk of asbestos-related disease as a result of exposure to the type of asbestos formerly used in the brakes on
  our vehicles. The extent of our financial exposure to asbestos litigation remains very difficult to estimate and could include
  both compensatory and punitive damage awards. The majority of our asbestos cases do not specify a dollar amount for
  damages; in many of the other cases the dollar amount specified is the jurisdictional minimum, and the vast majority of these
  cases involve multiple defendants. Some of these cases may also involve multiple plaintiffs, and we may be unable to tell
  from the pleadings which plaintiffs are making claims against us (as opposed to other defendants). Annual payout and
  defense costs may become significant in the future. Our accrual for asbestos matters includes probable losses for both
  asserted and unasserted claims.

  CONSUMER MATTERS

       We provide warranties on the vehicles we sell. Warranties are offered for specific periods of time and/or mileage and
  vary depending upon the type of product and the geographic location of its sale. Pursuant to these warranties, we will repair,
  replace, or adjust parts on a vehicle that are defective in factory-supplied materials or workmanship during the specified
  warranty period. We are a defendant in numerous actions in state and federal courts alleging breach of warranty and
  claiming damages based on state and federal consumer protection laws. Remedies under these statutes may include
  vehicle repurchase, civil penalties, and payment by Ford of the plaintiff’s attorneys’ fees. In some cases, plaintiffs also
  include an allegation of fraud. Remedies for a fraud claim may include contract rescission, vehicle repurchase, and punitive
  damages.

      The cost of these litigation matters is included in our warranty costs. We accrue obligations for warranty costs at the
  time of sale using a patterned estimation model that includes historical information regarding the nature, frequency, and
  average cost of claims for each vehicle line by model year. We reevaluate the adequacy of our accruals on a regular basis.

       We are currently a defendant in a significant number of litigation matters relating to the performance of vehicles,
  including those equipped with DPS6 transmissions.

  ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

      We have received notices under various federal and state environmental laws that we (along with others) are or may be
  a potentially responsible party for the costs associated with remediating numerous hazardous substance storage, recycling,
  or disposal sites in many states and, in some instances, for natural resource damages. We also may have been a generator
  of hazardous substances at a number of other sites. The amount of any such costs or damages for which we may be held
  responsible could be significant. Any legal proceeding arising under any federal, state, or local provisions that have been
  enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or primarily for the purpose of protecting the
  environment, in which (i) a governmental authority is a party, and (ii) we believe there is the possibility of monetary sanctions
  (exclusive of interest and costs) in excess of $1,000,000 is described herein.

      On June 16, 2022, the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (“NJDEP”) filed a complaint in the Superior
  Court of New Jersey (Bergen County) seeking natural resource damages and other claims related to the Ringwood
  Mines/Landfill Site located in Ringwood, New Jersey. We are defending the NJDEP’s allegations and have filed a motion to
  dismiss.




                                                                    30

26/04/23, 09:00                                                            f-20221231
  Item 3. Legal Proceedings (Continued)


  CLASS ACTIONS

        In light of the fact that few of the purported class actions filed against us in the past have been certified by the courts as
  class actions, in general we list those actions that (i) have been certified as a class action by a court of competent jurisdiction
  (and any additional purported class actions that raise allegations substantially similar to an existing and certified class), and
  (ii) have more than a remote risk of loss, and such loss would likely be significant if the action is resolved unfavorably to us.
  At this time, we have no such class actions filed against us.

  OTHER MATTERS

      Brazilian Tax Matters. One Brazilian state (São Paulo) and the Brazilian federal tax authority currently have outstanding
  substantial tax assessments against Ford Motor Company Brasil Ltda. (“Ford Brazil”) related to state and federal tax
  incentives Ford Brazil received for its operations in the Brazilian state of Bahia. The São Paulo assessment is part of a
  broader conflict among various states in Brazil. The federal legislature enacted laws designed to encourage the states to end
  that conflict, and in 2017 the states reached an agreement on a framework for resolution. Ford Brazil continues to pursue a
  resolution under the framework and expects the amount of any remaining assessments by the states to be resolved under
  that framework. The federal assessments are outside the scope of the legislation.

      All of the outstanding assessments have been appealed to the relevant administrative court of each jurisdiction. To
  proceed with an appeal within the judicial court system, an appellant may be required to post collateral. To date, we have not
  been required to post any collateral. If we are required to post collateral, which could be in excess of $1 billion, we expect it
  to be in the form of fixed assets, surety bonds, and/or letters of credit, but we may be required to post cash collateral.
  Although the ultimate resolution of these matters may take many years, we consider our overall risk of loss to be remote.

       Transit Connect Customs Penalty Notice. U.S. Customs and Border Protection (“CBP”) ruled in 2013 that Transit
  Connects imported as passenger wagons and later converted into cargo vans are subject to the 25% duty applicable to
  cargo vehicles, rather than the 2.5% duty applicable to passenger vehicles. We filed a challenge in the U.S. Court of
  International Trade (“CIT”), and CIT ruled in our favor in 2017. CBP subsequently filed a notice of appeal to the U.S. Court of
  Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which ruled in favor of CBP. Following the U.S. Supreme Court’s denial of our petition for a
  writ of certiorari in 2020, we paid the increased duties for certain prior imports, plus interest, and disclosed that CBP might
  assert a claim for penalties. Subsequently, CBP issued a penalty notice to us dated July 22, 2021, and on November 18,
  2021, CBP assessed against us a monetary penalty of $1.3 billion and additional duties of $181 million, plus interest. We
  intend to vigorously defend our actions and contest payment of the penalty and the additional duties.

       European Commission and U.K. Competition and Markets Authority Matter. On March 15, 2022, the European
  Commission (the “Commission”) and the U.K. Competition and Markets Authority (the “CMA”) conducted unannounced
  inspections at the premises of, and sent formal requests for information to, several companies and associations active in the
  automotive sector, including Ford. The inspections and requests for information concern possible collusion in relation to the
  collection, treatment, and recovery of end-of-life cars and vans (“ELVs”). We understand that the scope of the investigations
  includes determining whether manufacturers and importers of passenger cars and vans agreed to an approach to (i) the
  compensation of ELV collection, treatment, and recovery companies, and (ii) the use of data relating to the recyclability or
  recoverability of ELVs in marketing materials, and whether such conduct violates relevant competition laws. If a violation is
  found, a broad range of remedies is potentially available to the Commission and/or CMA, including imposing a fine and/or
  the prohibition or restriction of certain business practices. Given that this investigation is in its early stages, it is difficult to
  predict the outcome or what remedies, if any, may be imposed. We are cooperating with the Commission and the CMA as
  they complete their investigations.

      Market for Registrant’s Stock

      Our Common Stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange in the United States under the symbol F. As of
  January 30, 2023, stockholders of record of Ford included approximately 104,339 holders of Common Stock and 3 holders of
  Class B Stock. We believe that the number of beneficial owners is substantially greater than the number of record holders
  because a large portion of our Common Stock is held in “street name” by brokers.

  ITEM 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

  Key Trends and Economic Factors Affecting Ford and the Automotive Industry

      COVID-19 and Supplier Disruptions. The impact of COVID-19, including changes in consumer behavior, pandemic fears
  and market downturns, and restrictions on business and individual activities, has created significant volatility in the global
  economy. Outbreaks in certain regions continue to cause intermittent COVID-19-related disruptions in our supply chain and
  local manufacturing operations. We also continue to face supplier disruptions due to labor shortages and other production
  issues, in addition to the continuing semiconductor shortage. Our inconsistent production schedule has been disruptive to
  our suppliers’ operations, which, in turn, has led to higher costs and production shortfalls. Further, actions taken by Russia in
  Ukraine have impacted and could further impact our suppliers, particularly our lower tier suppliers, as well as our operations
  in Europe. For additional information on the impact of supplier disruptions, see the Outlook section on page 73.

       Currency Exchange Rate Volatility. After aggressively easing monetary policy in response to the COVID-19 pandemic,
  the Federal Reserve, and other central banks around the world, in 2022 began to withdraw monetary stimulus by raising
  interest rates. Periods of monetary policy tightening are often associated with heightened financial market and currency
  volatility, especially for those markets that are outliers in terms of their economic or monetary policy backdrop. This is notable
  for many emerging markets, which may also face increased exposure to commodity prices and political instability,
  contributing to unpredictable movements in the value of their exchange rates. In addition to direct impacts on the financial
  flows of global automotive companies, currency movements can also impact pricing of vehicles exported to overseas
  markets. In most markets, exchange rates are market-determined, and all are impacted by many different macroeconomic
  and policy factors, and thus likely to remain volatile. However, in some markets, exchange rates are heavily influenced or
  controlled by governments.

      Pricing Pressure. Over the last year, prices of both new and used vehicles have increased substantially due to strong
  demand, supply shortages, and inflationary costs. We have already observed some moderation in the rate of price increases
  as auto production slowly recovers from the semiconductor shortage, but it is unclear whether prices will decline fully to pre-
  COVID-19 pandemic levels. Over the long term, intense competition and excess capacity are likely to put downward
  pressure on inflation-adjusted prices for similarly-contented vehicles and contribute to a challenging pricing environment for
  the automotive industry in most major markets.

       Commodity and Energy Prices. Prices for commodities remain volatile. In some cases, spot prices for various
  commodities have recently diverged somewhat, as anticipated weakening in global industrial activity mitigates price
  increases for base metals such as steel and aluminum, while precious metals (e.g., palladium), and raw materials that are
  used in batteries for electric vehicles (e.g., lithium, cobalt, nickel, graphite, and manganese, among other materials, for
  batteries) remain high. The net impact on us and our suppliers has been higher material costs overall. To help ensure supply
  of raw materials for critical components (e.g., batteries), we, like others in the industry, have entered into multi-year sourcing
  agreements and may enter into additional agreements. Similar dynamics are impacting energy markets, with Europe
  particularly exposed to the risk of both higher prices and constraints on supply of natural gas due to the ongoing conflict in
  Ukraine. Such shortages may impact facilities operated by us or our suppliers, which could have an impact on us in Europe
  and other regions. In the long term, the outcome of de-carbonization and electrification of the vehicle fleet may depress oil
  demand, but the global energy transition will also contribute to ongoing volatility of oil and other energy prices. For additional
  information on commodity costs, see the Outlook section on page 73.

       Vehicle Profitability. Our financial results depend on the profitability of the vehicles we sell, which may vary significantly
  by vehicle line. In general, larger vehicles tend to command higher prices and be more profitable than smaller vehicles, both
  across and within vehicle segments. For example, in North America, our larger, more profitable vehicles had an average
  contribution margin that was 120% of our total average contribution margin across all vehicles, whereas our smaller vehicles
  had significantly lower contribution margins. In addition, government regulations aimed at reducing emissions and increasing
  fuel efficiency (e.g., ZEV mandates and low emission zones), and other factors that accelerate the transition to electrified
  vehicles, may increase the cost of vehicles by more than the perceived benefit to consumers and dampen margins.

  Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)


        Trade Policy. To the extent governments in various regions implement or intensify barriers to imports, such as erecting
  tariff or non-tariff barriers or manipulating their currency, and provide advantages to local exporters selling into the global
  marketplace, there can be a significant negative impact on manufacturers based in other markets. While we believe the long-
  term trend will support the growth of free trade, we will continue to monitor and address developing issues.

      Inflation and Interest Rates. We continue to see near-term impacts on our business due to inflation, including ongoing
  global price pressures in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, driving up energy prices, freight premiums, and other
  operating costs above normal rates. Although headline inflation in the United States and Europe appears to have peaked, as
  gasoline and natural gas prices recede from the latest spike, core inflation (excluding food and energy prices) remains
  elevated and is a source of continued cost pressure on businesses and households. Interest rates have increased
  significantly as central banks in developed countries attempt to subdue inflation while government deficits and debt remain at
  high levels in many global markets. Accordingly, the eventual implications of higher government deficits and debt, tighter
  monetary policy, and potentially higher long-term interest rates may drive a higher cost of capital for the business. At Ford
  Credit, rising interest rates may impact its ability to source funding and offer financing at competitive rates, which could
  reduce its financing margin.

  Revenue

       Our Automotive segment revenue is generated primarily by sales of vehicles, parts, and accessories. Revenue is
  recorded when control is transferred to our customers (generally, our dealers and distributors). For the majority of sales, this
  occurs when products are shipped from our manufacturing facilities. However, we defer a portion of the consideration
  received when there is a separate future or stand-ready performance obligation, such as extended service contracts or
  ongoing vehicle connectivity. Revenue related to extended service contracts is recognized over the term of the agreement in
  proportion to the costs we expect to incur in satisfying the contract obligations; revenue related to other future or stand-ready
  performance obligations is generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the period in which services are expected to be
  performed. Vehicles sold to daily rental car companies with an obligation to repurchase for a guaranteed amount, exercisable
  at the option of the customer, are accounted for as operating leases, with lease revenue recognized over the term of the
  lease. Proceeds from the sale of vehicles at auction are recognized in revenue upon transfer of control of the vehicle to the
  buyer.

      Most of the vehicles sold by us to our dealers and distributors are financed at wholesale by Ford Credit. Upon Ford
  Credit originating the wholesale receivable related to a dealer’s purchase of a vehicle, Ford Credit pays cash to the relevant
  Automotive legal entity in payment of the dealer’s obligation for the purchase price of the vehicle. The dealer then pays the
  wholesale finance receivable to Ford Credit when it sells the vehicle to a retail customer.

       Our Ford Credit segment revenue is generated primarily from interest on finance receivables and revenue from
  operating leases. Revenue from interest on finance receivables is recognized over the term of the receivable using the
  interest method and includes the amortization of certain deferred origination costs. Revenue from operating leases is
  recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.

      Transactions between our Automotive and Ford Credit segments occur in the ordinary course of business. For example,
  we offer special retail financing and lease incentives to dealers’ customers who choose to finance or lease our vehicles from
  Ford Credit. The cost for these incentives is included in our estimate of variable consideration at the date the related vehicle
  sales to our dealers are recorded. In order to compensate Ford Credit for the lower interest or lease payments offered to the
  retail customer, we pay the discounted value of the incentive directly to Ford Credit when it originates the retail finance or
  lease contract with the dealer’s customer. Ford Credit recognizes the incentive amount over the life of retail finance contracts
  as an element of financing revenue and over the life of lease contracts as a reduction to depreciation. See Note 1 of the
  Notes to the Financial Statements for a more detailed discussion of transactions between our Automotive and Ford Credit
  segments.

  Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)


  Costs and Expenses

       Our income statement classifies our Company excluding Ford Credit total costs and expenses into two categories:
  (i) cost of sales, and (ii) selling, administrative, and other expenses. We include within cost of sales those costs related to the
  development, production, and distribution of our vehicles, parts, accessories, and services. Specifically, we include in cost of
  sales each of the following: material costs (including commodity costs); freight costs; warranty, including product recall costs;
  labor and other costs related to the development and production of our vehicles and connectivity, parts, accessories, and
  services; depreciation and amortization; and other associated costs. We include within selling, administrative, and other
  expenses labor and other costs not directly related to the development and production of our vehicles, parts, accessories,
  and services, including such expenses as advertising and sales promotion costs.

       Certain of our costs, such as material costs, generally vary directly with changes in volume and mix of production. In our
  industry, production volume often varies significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year. Quarterly production volumes
  experience seasonal shifts throughout the year (including peak retail sales seasons and the impact on production of model
  changeover and new product launches). Annual production volumes are heavily impacted by external economic factors,
  including the pace of economic growth and factors such as the availability of consumer credit and cost of fuel.

      As a result, we analyze the profit impact of certain cost changes holding constant present-year volume and mix and
  currency exchange, in order to evaluate our cost trends absent the impact of varying production and currency exchange
  levels. We analyze these cost changes in the following categories:

      •    Contribution Costs – these costs typically vary with production volume. These costs include material (including
           commodity), warranty, and freight and duty costs.

      •    Structural Costs – these costs typically do not have a directly proportionate relationship to production volume. These
           costs include manufacturing; vehicle and software engineering; spending-related; advertising and sales promotion;
           administrative, information technology, and selling; and pension and OPEB costs.

      While contribution costs generally vary directly in proportion to production volume, elements within our structural costs
  category are impacted to differing degrees by changes in production volume. We also have varying degrees of discretion
  when it comes to controlling the different elements within our structural costs. For example, depreciation and amortization
  expense largely is associated with prior capital spending decisions. On the other hand, while labor costs do not vary directly
  with production volume, manufacturing labor costs may be impacted by changes in volume, for example when we increase
  overtime, add a production shift, or add personnel to support volume increases. Other structural costs, such as advertising or
  engineering costs, do not necessarily have a directly proportionate relationship to production volume. Our structural costs
  generally are within our discretion, although to varying degrees, and can be adjusted over time in response to external
  factors.

      We consider certain structural costs to be a direct investment in future growth and revenue. For example, structural costs
  are necessary to grow our business and improve profitability, invest in new products and technologies, respond to increasing
  industry sales volume, and grow our market share.

      Cost of sales and Selling, administrative, and other expenses for full year 2022 were $145.3 billion. Our Automotive
  segment’s material and commodity costs make up the largest portion of these costs and expenses, followed by structural
  costs. Although material costs are our largest absolute cost, our margins can be affected significantly by changes in any
  category of costs.

  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - 2022

     The net loss attributable to Ford Motor Company was $1,981 million in 2022. Company adjusted EBIT was
  $10,415 million.

      Net income/(loss) includes certain items (“special items”) that are excluded from Company adjusted EBIT. These items
  are discussed in more detail in Note 26 of the Notes to the Financial Statements. We report special items separately to allow
  investors analyzing our results to identify certain infrequent significant items that they may wish to exclude when considering
  the trend of ongoing operating results. Our pre-tax and tax special items were as follows (in millions):
                                                                                                       2021                2022

  __________
  (a) Includes related tax effect on special items and tax special items.


      We recorded $12.2 billion of pre-tax special item charges in 2022, driven by a $7.4 billion mark-to-market net loss on our
  Rivian investment and a $2.7 billion impairment on our Argo investment.

      In Note 26 of the Notes to the Financial Statements, special items are reflected as a separate reconciling item, as
  opposed to being allocated among the Automotive, Mobility, and Ford Credit segments. This reflects the fact that
  management excludes these items from its review of operating segment results for purposes of measuring segment
  profitability and allocating resources.

  the mark-to-market net loss on our Rivian investment and the impairment on our Argo investment, and lower Ford Credit
  EBT, partially offset by higher Automotive EBIT. The year-over-year increase of $400 million in Company adjusted EBIT
  primarily reflects higher Automotive EBIT, offset partially by lower Ford Credit EBT.

      In 2022, wholesales in our Automotive segment increased 7% from a year ago, primarily reflecting stronger wholesales
  in North America. Full year 2022 Automotive revenue increased 18%, driven by higher wholesales and net pricing, offset
  partially by weaker currencies.

       Our full year 2022 Automotive segment EBIT was $9.7 billion, an increase of $2.3 billion from a year ago, with an EBIT
  margin of 6.5%. The EBIT improvement was driven by higher net pricing and higher wholesales, offset partially by
  inflationary increases on commodity, material, and freight costs, higher structural costs (including growth-related
  investments), unfavorable mix, weaker currencies, and higher warranty costs.

  13.4%. The EBIT improvement was driven by higher net pricing, offset partially by inflationary increases on material,
  commodity, and freight costs. The strong results in South America reflect our restructuring efforts and pricing and were
  further aided by a balance sheet revaluation in Argentina, the effect of which is not expected to be sustained.

     In Europe, 2022 wholesales increased 14% from a year ago, primarily reflecting an improvement in production-related
  supply constraints. Full year 2022 revenue improved 5%, driven by higher wholesales and net pricing, offset partially by
  weaker currencies.

     Europe’s 2022 EBIT was $47 million, an improvement of $201 million from a year ago, with an EBIT margin of 0.2%. The
  EBIT improvement was driven by higher net pricing and higher wholesales, offset partially by inflationary increases on
  commodity, material, and freight costs, higher structural costs, and weaker currencies.

      In China, 2022 wholesales decreased 24% from a year ago, driven by COVID-related restrictions and a weaker
  commercial vehicle industry. Full year 2022 revenue at our consolidated operations decreased 31%, primarily driven by
  lower component sales to our joint ventures in China and lower wholesales.

      China’s 2022 EBIT loss was $572 million, a $245 million higher loss than a year ago, with an EBIT margin of negative
  32.3%. The EBIT decrease was driven by lower volume and weaker currency, offset partially by lower costs and higher
  profits at our joint ventures.

  Definitions and Information Regarding Automotive Causal Factors

      In general, we measure year-over-year change in Automotive segment EBIT using the causal factors listed below, with
  net pricing and cost variances calculated at present-year volume and mix and exchange:

  •   Market Factors (exclude the impact of unconsolidated affiliate wholesale units):
      ◦ Volume and Mix – primarily measures EBIT variance from changes in wholesale unit volumes (at prior-year average
         contribution margin per unit) driven by changes in industry volume, market share, and dealer stocks, as well as the
         EBIT variance resulting from changes in product mix, including mix among vehicle lines and mix of trim levels and
         options within a vehicle line
      ◦ Net Pricing – primarily measures EBIT variance driven by changes in wholesale unit prices to dealers and marketing
         incentive programs such as rebate programs, low-rate financing offers, special lease offers, and stock adjustments
         on dealer inventory

  •   Cost:
      ◦ Contribution Costs – primarily measures EBIT variance driven by per-unit changes in cost categories that typically
         vary with volume, such as material costs (including commodity and component costs), warranty expense, and freight
         and duty costs
      ◦ Structural Costs – primarily measures EBIT variance driven by absolute change in cost categories that typically do
         not have a directly proportionate relationship to production volume. Structural costs include the following cost
         categories:
         ▪ Manufacturing, Including Volume-Related - consists primarily of costs for hourly and salaried manufacturing
             personnel, plant overhead (such as utilities and taxes), and new product launch expense. These costs could be
             affected by volume for operating pattern actions such as overtime, line-speed, and shift schedules
         ▪ Engineering and Connectivity – consists primarily of costs for vehicle and software engineering personnel,
             prototype materials, testing, and outside engineering and software services
         ▪ Spending-Related – consists primarily of depreciation and amortization of our manufacturing and engineering
             assets, but also includes asset retirements and operating leases
         ▪ Advertising and Sales Promotions – includes costs for advertising, marketing programs, brand promotions,
             customer mailings and promotional events, and auto shows
         ▪ Administrative, Information Technology, and Selling – includes primarily costs for salaried personnel and
             purchased services related to our staff activities, information technology, and selling functions
         ▪ Pension and OPEB – consists primarily of past service pension costs and other postretirement employee benefit
             costs

  •   Exchange – primarily measures EBIT variance driven by one or more of the following: (i) transactions denominated in
      currencies other than the functional currencies of the relevant entities, (ii) effects of converting functional currency
      income to U.S. dollars, (iii) effects of remeasuring monetary assets and liabilities of the relevant entities in currencies
      other than their functional currency, or (iv) results of our foreign currency hedging

  •   Other – includes a variety of items, such as parts and services earnings, royalties, government incentives, and
      compensation-related changes

      In addition, definitions and calculations used in this report include:

  •   Wholesales and Revenue – wholesale unit volumes include all Ford and Lincoln badged units (whether produced by
      Ford or by an unconsolidated affiliate) that are sold to dealerships or others, units manufactured by Ford that are sold to
      other manufacturers, units distributed by Ford for other manufacturers, and local brand units produced by our China
      joint venture, Jiangling Motors Corporation, Ltd. (“JMC”), that are sold to dealerships or others. Vehicles sold to daily
      rental car companies that are subject to a guaranteed repurchase option (i.e., rental repurchase), as well as other sales
      of finished vehicles for which the recognition of revenue is deferred (e.g., consignments), also are included in wholesale
      unit volumes. Revenue from certain vehicles in wholesale unit volumes (specifically, Ford badged vehicles produced and
      distributed by our unconsolidated affiliates, as well as JMC brand vehicles) are not included in our revenue

  •   Industry Volume and Market Share – based, in part, on estimated vehicle registrations; includes medium and heavy duty
      trucks

  •   SAAR – seasonally adjusted annual rate


                                                                    45

  Mobility Segment

      The Mobility segment primarily includes development costs for Ford’s autonomous vehicles and related businesses,
  Ford’s equity ownership in Argo AI (a developer of autonomous driving systems), and other mobility businesses and
  investments.

      In our Mobility segment, our 2022 EBIT loss improved $104 million from a year ago. The $926 million EBIT loss reflects
  our strategic investments in our autonomous vehicle capabilities and support of our mobility initiatives.

       In the third quarter of 2022, we made the strategic decision to shift our capital spending from L4 technology being
  developed by Argo AI to advanced L2/L3 systems, which we believe will ultimately be essential to achieve profitable
  commercialization of L4 autonomy at scale in the future. Additionally, because of the significant additional capital and time
  required to achieve commercialization of L4, as well as other macroeconomic factors, Argo AI has been unable to attract new
  investors. After performing external outreach in the third quarter to assess market interest in acquiring either Argo AI or its
  technology components and conducting internal reviews to evaluate opportunities to leverage Argo AI’s technology, Ford
  determined that Argo AI no longer has value as a going concern. As a result, we reassessed the carrying value of our
  investment in Argo AI starting from September 30, 2022, and in October, Ford and VW initiated the process of exiting the
  joint development of L4 technology through Argo AI. Accordingly, in the second half of 2022, we recorded as a special item a
  $2.7 billion pre-tax impairment on our Argo AI investment, and on October 26, 2022, we announced that Argo AI plans to
  wind down operations, which is in progress.

       Total net receivables at December 31, 2022 were $5 billion higher than a year ago, primarily reflecting higher non-
  consumer financing, offset partially by fewer operating leases, lower consumer financing, and currency exchange rates. Ford
  Credit’s loss metrics reflected healthy and stable consumer credit conditions and strong auction values. Ford Credit’s U.S.
  36-month auction values for off-lease vehicles were up 8% from a year ago, reflecting strong demand for used vehicles,
  including the impact of lower new vehicle production due to the semiconductor shortage. We are planning for full year 2023
  auction values to decrease as supply constraints improve.

      Ford Credit’s 2022 EBT of $2,657 million was $2,060 million lower than a year ago, reflecting lower credit loss and lease
  residual reserve releases, lower financing margin, and lower lease return rates.

  Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)


  Definitions and Information Regarding Ford Credit Causal Factors

      In general, we measure year-over-year changes in Ford Credit’s EBT using the causal factors listed below:

  •   Volume and Mix:
      ◦ Volume primarily measures changes in net financing margin driven by changes in average net receivables excluding
          the allowance for credit losses at prior period financing margin yield (defined below in financing margin) at prior
          period exchange rates. Volume changes are primarily driven by the volume of new and used vehicles sold and
          leased, the extent to which Ford Credit purchases retail financing and operating lease contracts, the extent to which
          Ford Credit provides wholesale financing, the sales price of the vehicles financed, the level of dealer inventories,
          Ford-sponsored special financing programs available exclusively through Ford Credit, and the availability of cost-
          effective funding
      ◦ Mix primarily measures changes in net financing margin driven by period-over-period changes in the composition of
          Ford Credit’s average net receivables excluding the allowance for credit losses by product within each region

  •   Financing Margin:
      ◦ Financing margin variance is the period-to-period change in financing margin yield multiplied by the present period
          average net receivables excluding the allowance for credit losses at prior period exchange rates. This calculation is
          performed at the product and country level and then aggregated. Financing margin yield equals revenue, less
          interest expense and scheduled depreciation for the period, divided by average net receivables excluding the
          allowance for credit losses for the same period
      ◦ Financing margin changes are driven by changes in revenue and interest expense. Changes in revenue are
          primarily driven by the level of market interest rates, cost assumptions in pricing, mix of business, and competitive
          environment. Changes in interest expense are primarily driven by the level of market interest rates, borrowing
          spreads, and asset-liability management

  •   Credit Loss:
      ◦ Credit loss is the change in the provision for credit losses at prior period exchange rates. For analysis purposes,
         management splits the provision for credit losses into net charge-offs and the change in the allowance for credit
         losses
      ◦ Net charge-off changes are primarily driven by the number of repossessions, severity per repossession, and
         recoveries. Changes in the allowance for credit losses are primarily driven by changes in historical trends in credit
         losses and recoveries, changes in the composition and size of Ford Credit’s present portfolio, changes in trends in
         historical used vehicle values, and changes in forward looking macroeconomic conditions. For additional information,
         refer to the “Critical Accounting Estimates - Allowance for Credit Losses” section of Item 7 of Part II of our 2022 Form
         10-K Report

  •   Lease Residual:
      ◦ Lease residual measures changes to residual performance at prior period exchange rates. For analysis purposes,
         management splits residual performance primarily into residual gains and losses, and the change in accumulated
         supplemental depreciation
      ◦ Residual gain and loss changes are primarily driven by the number of vehicles returned to Ford Credit and sold, and
         the difference between the auction value and the depreciated value (which includes both base and accumulated
         supplemental depreciation) of the vehicles sold. Changes in accumulated supplemental depreciation are primarily
         driven by changes in Ford Credit’s estimate of the expected auction value at the end of the lease term, and changes
         in Ford Credit’s estimate of the number of vehicles that will be returned to it and sold. Depreciation on vehicles
         subject to operating leases includes early termination losses on operating leases due to customer default events.
         For additional information, refer to the “Critical Accounting Estimates - Accumulated Depreciation on Vehicles
         Subject to Operating Leases” section of Item 7 of Part II of our 2022 Form 10-K Report

  •   Exchange:
      ◦ Reflects changes in EBT driven by the effects of converting functional currency income to U.S. dollars

  •   Other:
      ◦ Primarily includes operating expenses, other revenue, insurance expenses, and other income/(loss) at prior period
         exchange rates
      ◦ Changes in operating expenses are primarily driven by salaried personnel costs, facilities costs, and costs
         associated with the origination and servicing of customer contracts
      ◦ In general, other income/(loss) changes are primarily driven by changes in earnings related to market valuation
         adjustments to derivatives (primarily related to movements in interest rates) and other miscellaneous items


                                                                    48

  Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)


      In addition, the following definitions and calculations apply to Ford Credit when used in this Report:

  •   Cash (as shown in the Funding Structure and Liquidity tables) – Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities,
      excluding amounts related to insurance activities

  •   Debt (as shown in the Key Metrics and Leverage tables) – Debt on Ford Credit’s balance sheets. Includes debt issued in
      securitizations and payable only out of collections on the underlying securitized assets and related enhancements. Ford
      Credit holds the right to receive the excess cash flows not needed to pay the debt issued by, and other obligations of, the
      securitization entities that are parties to those securitization transactions

  •   Earnings Before Taxes (“EBT”) – Reflects Ford Credit’s income before income taxes

  •   Loss-to-Receivables (“LTR”) Ratio – LTR ratio is calculated using net charge-offs divided by average finance
      receivables, excluding unearned interest supplements and the allowance for credit losses

  •   Return on Equity (“ROE”) (as shown in the Key Metrics table) – Reflects return on equity calculated by annualizing net
      income for the period and dividing by monthly average equity for the period

  •   Securitization and Restricted Cash (as shown in the Liquidity table) – Securitization cash is held for the benefit of the
      securitization investors (for example, a reserve fund). Restricted cash primarily includes cash held to meet certain local
      governmental and regulatory reserve requirements and cash held under the terms of certain contractual agreements

  •   Securitizations (as shown in the Public Term Funding Plan table) – Public securitization transactions, Rule 144A offerings
      sponsored by Ford Credit, and widely distributed offerings by Ford Credit Canada

  •   Term Asset-Backed Securities (as shown in the Funding Structure table) – Obligations issued in securitization
      transactions that are payable only out of collections on the underlying securitized assets and related enhancements

  •   Total Net Receivables (as shown in the Key Metrics table) – Includes finance receivables (retail financing and wholesale)
      sold for legal purposes and net investment in operating leases included in securitization transactions that do not satisfy
      the requirements for accounting sale treatment. These receivables and operating leases are reported on Ford Credit’s
      balance sheets and are available only for payment of the debt issued by, and other obligations of, the securitization
      entities that are parties to those securitization transactions; they are not available to pay the other obligations of Ford
      Credit or the claims of Ford Credit’s other creditors

  Corporate Other

       Corporate Other primarily includes corporate governance expenses, interest income (excluding interest earned on our
  extended service contract portfolio that is included in our Automotive segment) and gains and losses from our cash, cash
  equivalents, and marketable securities (excluding gains and losses on investments in equity securities), and foreign
  exchange derivatives gains and losses associated with intercompany lending. Corporate governance expenses are primarily
  administrative, delivering benefit on behalf of the global enterprise, that are not allocated to operating segments. These
  include expenses related to setting and directing global policy, providing oversight and stewardship, and promoting the
  Company’s interests. For full year 2022, Corporate Other had a $1,008 million loss, compared with a $1,084 million loss in
  2021. The improvement was driven by higher Automotive interest income due to higher interest rates (primarily Fed Funds).

  Interest on Debt

     Interest on Debt consists of interest expense on Company debt excluding Ford Credit. Our full year 2022 interest
  expense on Company debt excluding Ford Credit was $1,259 million, $544 million lower than in 2021, primarily explained by
  U.S. debt restructuring actions taken in the fourth quarter of 2021 and during 2022.



                                                                    49

  Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)


  Taxes

      Our Provision for/(Benefit from) income taxes for full year 2022 was a $864 million benefit, resulting in an effective tax
  rate of 28.6%. This includes benefits arising from the reversal of U.S. valuation allowances, primarily as a result of planning
  actions.

      Our full year 2022 adjusted effective tax rate, which excludes special items, was 18.7%.

       We regularly review our organizational structure and income tax elections for affiliates in non-U.S. and U.S. tax
  jurisdictions, which may result in changes in affiliates that are included in or excluded from our U.S. tax return. Any future
  changes to our structure, as well as any changes in income tax laws in the countries that we operate, could cause increases
  or decreases to our deferred tax balances and related valuation allowances.


                                                                    50

  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - 2021

     The net income attributable to Ford Motor Company was $17,937 million in 2021. Company adjusted EBIT was
  $10,000 million.

      Net income/(loss) includes certain items (“special items”) that are excluded from Company adjusted EBIT. These items
  are discussed in more detail in Note 26 of the Notes to the Financial Statements. We report special items separately to allow
  investors analyzing our results to identify certain infrequent significant items that they may wish to exclude when considering
  the trend of ongoing operating results. Our pre-tax and tax special items were as follows (in millions):

  __________
  (a) Includes related tax effect on special items and tax special items.


      For full year 2021, we recorded $9.6 billion of pre-tax special items, primarily reflecting gains on our equity investment in
  Rivian in connection with Rivian’s initial public offering and mark-to-market valuation adjustments during the year, as well as
  a remeasurement gain associated with our global pension and OPEB plans. The gains were partially offset by costs
  associated with our Global Redesign actions and a debt extinguishment premium associated with the repurchase and
  redemption of $7.6 billion of our higher-coupon debt.

      In Note 26 of the Notes to the Financial Statements, special items are reflected as a separate reconciling item, as
  opposed to being allocated among the Automotive, Mobility, and Ford Credit segments. This reflects the fact that
  management excludes these items from its review of operating segment results for purposes of measuring segment
  profitability and allocating resources.

     In 2021, wholesales in our Automotive segment declined 6% from 2020, reflecting semiconductor-related production
  constraints and the shift to a new business model in South America. Full year 2021 Automotive revenue increased 9% from
  2020, driven by higher net pricing, favorable mix, and stronger currencies, partially offset by lower wholesales.

      Our full year 2021 Automotive segment EBIT increased $5.7 billion from 2020 with an EBIT margin of 5.9 percent. The
  EBIT improvement was driven by higher net pricing (reflecting the strength of our product portfolio and lower incentives in
  response to reduced dealer stock levels), lower warranty expense, favorable mix, higher profits from our Ford Customer
  Service Division business, and stronger currencies, partially offset by lower wholesales and increased commodity costs.

      In China, 2021 wholesales increased 5% from 2020, driven by higher joint venture volumes. Full year 2021 consolidated
  revenue declined 20% from 2020, driven by product localization and the de-consolidation of our operations in Taiwan,
  partially offset by favorable import mix, higher component sales to our joint ventures in China, and stronger currencies.

       China’s 2021 EBIT loss improved $172 million from 2020 with an EBIT margin of negative 12.8%. The EBIT
  improvement was driven by favorable mix of imported vehicles, higher joint venture profits and royalties, and higher net
  pricing, partially offset by lower volume at our consolidated operations.

       Total net receivables at December 31, 2021 were $14 billion lower than at December 31, 2020, primarily reflecting lower
  wholesale receivables as a result of lower dealer inventories due to the semiconductor shortage. Ford Credit’s loss metrics
  reflected healthy and stable consumer credit conditions and strong auction values. Ford Credit’s U.S. 36-month auction
  values for off-lease vehicles were up 26% from 2020, reflecting strong demand for used vehicles, including the impact of
  lower new vehicle production due to the semiconductor shortage.

       Ford Credit’s 2021 EBT increased $2,109 million from 2020, explained primarily by favorable operating lease residual
  performance, the non-recurrence of the 2020 increase to the credit loss reserve due to deterioration in macroeconomic
  conditions related to COVID-19, and reductions in the credit loss reserve in 2021, partially offset by lower volume driven by
  the impact of the global semiconductor shortage and lower financing margin.

  Corporate Other

     For full year 2021, Corporate Other had a $1,084 million loss, compared with a $726 million loss in 2020. The higher loss
  was driven by lower interest income and higher administrative and IT-related expenses.

  Interest on Debt

      Our full year 2021 interest expense on Company debt excluding Ford Credit was $1,803 million, $154 million higher than
  in 2020, primarily explained by higher U.S. unsecured debt interest expense.

  Taxes

      Our Provision for/(Benefit from) income taxes for full year 2021 was a $130 million benefit, resulting in an effective tax
  rate of negative 0.7%. This includes a benefit of $2.9 billion to recognize deferred tax assets resulting from changes in our
  global tax structure and a $918 million benefit from the reversal of U.S. valuation allowances.

      Our full year 2021 adjusted effective tax rate, which excludes special items, was 21.9%.

  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

      At December 31, 2022, total balance sheet cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, and restricted cash, including
  Ford Credit and entities held for sale, was $44.3 billion.

      We consider our key balance sheet metrics to be: (i) Company cash, which includes cash equivalents, marketable
  securities, and restricted cash, including cash held for sale, excluding Ford Credit’s cash, cash equivalents, marketable
  securities, and restricted cash; and (ii) Company liquidity, which includes Company cash, less restricted cash, and total
  available committed credit lines, excluding Ford Credit’s total available committed credit lines.

      Liquidity. One of our key priorities is to maintain a strong balance sheet, while at the same time having resources
  available to invest in and grow our business. At December 31, 2022, we had Company cash of $32.3 billion and liquidity of
  $48.0 billion, including approximately $194 million of Rivian marketable securities. In 2022, we sold approximately 91 million
  of our Rivian shares resulting in proceeds of about $3 billion. As marketable securities increase or decrease in value,
  Company cash and liquidity will likewise increase or decrease. At December 31, 2022, about 89% of Company cash was
  held by consolidated entities domiciled in the United States.

       To be prepared for an economic downturn, we target an ongoing Company cash balance at or above $20 billion plus
  significant additional liquidity above our Company cash target. We expect to have periods when we will be above or below
  this amount due to: (i) future cash flow expectations, such as for investments in future opportunities, capital investments,
  debt maturities, pension contributions, or restructuring requirements, (ii) short-term timing differences, and (iii) changes in the
  global economic environment.

      Our Company cash investments (excluding the Rivian marketable securities) primarily include U.S. Department of
  Treasury obligations, federal agency securities, bank time deposits with investment-grade institutions, investment-grade
  corporate securities, investment-grade commercial paper, and debt obligations of a select group of non-U.S. governments,
  non-U.S. governmental agencies, and supranational institutions. The average maturity of these investments is approximately
  one year and adjusted based on market conditions and liquidity needs. We monitor our Company cash levels and average
  maturity on a daily basis.

      Material Cash Requirements. Our material cash requirements include:

      •    Capital expenditures (for additional information, see the “Changes in Company Cash” section below) and other
           payments for engineering, software, product development, and implementation of our plans for electric vehicles

      •    Purchase of raw materials and components to support the manufacturing and sale of vehicles (including electric
           vehicles), parts, and accessories (for additional information, see the Aggregate Contractual Obligations table and the
           accompanying description of our “Purchase obligations” below)

      •    Marketing incentive payments to dealers

      •    Payments for warranty and field service actions (for additional information, see Note 25 of the Notes to the Financial
           Statements)

      •    Debt repayments (for additional information, see the Aggregate Contractual Obligations table below and Note 19 of
           the Notes the Financial Statements)

      •    Discretionary and mandatory payments to our global pension plans (for additional information, see the Aggregate
           Contractual Obligations table below, the “Changes in Company Cash” section below, and Note 17 of the Notes to the
           Financial Statements)

      •    Employee wages, benefits, and incentives

      •    Operating lease payments (for additional information, see the Aggregate Contractual Obligations table below and
           Note 18 of the Notes to the Financial Statements)

      •    Cash effects related to the global redesign of our business (for additional information, see the “Changes in Company
           Cash” section below)

      •    Strategic acquisitions and investments to grow our business, including electrification

      Subject to approval by our Board of Directors, shareholder distributions in the form of dividend payments and/or a share
  repurchase program (including share repurchases to offset the anti-dilutive effect of increased shared-based compensation)
  may require the expenditure of a material amount of cash. Moreover, we may be subject to additional material cash
  requirements that are contingent upon the occurrence of certain events, e.g., legal contingencies, uncertain tax positions,
  and other matters.

       We are party to many contractual obligations involving commitments to make payments to third parties, and, as noted
  above, such commitments require a material amount of cash. Most of these are debt obligations incurred by our Ford Credit
  segment. In addition, as part of our normal business practices, we enter into contracts with suppliers for purchases of certain
  raw materials, components, and services to facilitate adequate supply of these materials and services. These arrangements,
  including multi-year offtake commitments, may contain fixed or minimum quantity purchase requirements. “Purchase
  obligations” in the Aggregate Contractual Obligations table below are defined as off-balance sheet agreements to purchase
  goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on the Company and that specify all significant terms; however, as
  we purchase raw materials and components beyond the minimum amounts required by the “Purchase obligations,” our
  material cash requirements for these items are higher than what is reflected in the Aggregate Contractual Obligations table.
  For additional information on the timing of these payments and the impact on our working capital, see the “Changes in
  Company Cash” section below.

  timing differences (including timing differences between accrual-based EBIT and associated cash flows). Non-operating
  items include: global redesign (including separation payments), changes in Company debt excluding Ford Credit,
  contributions to funded pension plans, shareholder distributions, and other items (including gains and losses on investments
  in equity securities, acquisitions and divestitures, equity investments, and other transactions with Ford Credit).

  Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)


      With respect to “Changes in working capital,” in general we carry relatively low Automotive segment trade receivables
  compared with our trade payables because the majority of our Automotive wholesales are financed (primarily by Ford Credit)
  immediately upon the sale of vehicles to dealers, which generally occurs shortly after being produced. In contrast, our
  Automotive trade payables are based primarily on industry-standard production supplier payment terms of about 45 days. As
  a result, our cash flow deteriorates if wholesale volumes (and the corresponding revenue) decrease while trade payables
  continue to become due. Conversely, our cash flow improves if wholesale volumes (and the corresponding revenue)
  increase while new trade payables are generally not due for about 45 days. For example, the suspension of production at
  most of our assembly plants and lower industry volumes due to COVID-19 in early 2020 resulted in an initial deterioration of
  our cash flow, while the subsequent resumption of manufacturing operations and return to pre-COVID-19 production levels at
  most of our assembly plants resulted in a subsequent improvement of our cash flow. Even in normal economic conditions,
  however, these working capital balances generally are subject to seasonal changes that can impact cash flow. For example,
  we typically experience cash flow timing differences associated with inventories and payables due to our annual summer and
  December shutdown periods when production, and therefore inventories and wholesale volumes, are usually at their lowest
  levels, while payables continue to come due and be paid. The net impact of this typically results in cash outflows from
  changes in our working capital balances during these shutdown periods.

     Our finished product inventory at December 31, 2022 was higher year over year due to production and release
  scheduling, which resulted in higher sales inventory, in-transit inventory, and units awaiting upfit.

      In response to, or in anticipation of, supplier disruptions, we may stockpile certain components or raw materials to help
  prevent disruption in our production of vehicles. Such actions could have a short-term adverse impact on our cash and
  increase our inventory. Moreover, in order to secure critical materials for production of electric vehicles, we have entered into
  and plan to continue to enter into offtake agreements with raw material suppliers and make investments in certain raw
  material and battery suppliers, including contributing up to $6.6 billion in capital to BlueOval SK, LLC over a five-year period
  ending in 2026. Such investments, which are part of our plan to invest over $50 billion in electric vehicles through 2026,
  could have an additional adverse impact on our cash in the near-term.

      The terms of the offtake agreements we have entered into, and those we may enter into in the future, vary by
  transaction, though they generally obligate us to purchase a certain percentage or minimum amount of output produced by
  the counterparty over an agreed upon period of time. The purchase price mechanism included in the offtake agreement is
  typically based on the market price of the material at the time of delivery. The terms also may include conditions to our
  obligation to purchase the materials, such as quality or minimum output. Subject to satisfaction of those conditions, we will
  be obligated to purchase the materials at the cost determined by the purchase price mechanism. Based on the offtake
  agreements we have entered into thus far, the earliest date by which we could be obligated to purchase any output, subject
  to satisfaction of the applicable conditions, will be in 2024.

       Financial institutions participate in a supply chain finance (“SCF”) program that enables our suppliers, at their sole
  discretion, to sell their Ford receivables (i.e., our payment obligations to the suppliers) to the financial institutions on a non-
  recourse basis in order to be paid earlier than our payment terms provide. Our suppliers’ voluntary inclusion of invoices in the
  SCF program has no bearing on our payment terms, the amounts we pay, or our liquidity. We have no economic interest in a
  supplier’s decision to participate in the SCF program, and we have no direct financial relationship with the SCF financial
  institutions. Moreover, we do not provide any guarantees in connection with the SCF program. As of December 31, 2022, the
  outstanding amount of Ford receivables that suppliers elected to sell to the SCF financial institutions was $253 million. The
  amount settled through the SCF program during 2022 was $1.4 billion.

      Our full year 2022 Net cash provided by/(used in) operating activities was positive $6.9 billion, a decrease of $8.9 billion
  from a year ago (see page 79 for additional information). The year-over-year decrease was driven by a decrease in Ford
  Credit operating cash flow partially offset by favorable timing differences. Company adjusted free cash flow was $9.1 billion,
  $4.5 billion higher than a year ago, driven by higher Company adjusted EBIT excluding Ford Credit, timing benefits,
  improvement in working capital, and lower interest expense, offset partially by lower Ford Credit distributions.

      Capital spending was $6.5 billion in 2022, $0.3 billion higher than a year ago, and is expected to be in the range of
  $8 billion to $9 billion in 2023.

       The full year 2022 working capital impact was $0.2 billion positive, driven by higher payables. All other and timing
  differences were positive $1.9 billion. Timing differences include differences between accrual-based EBIT and the associated
  cash flows (e.g., pension and OPEB income or expense; compensation payments; marketing incentive and warranty
  payments to dealers).

     Shareholder distributions (including dividends and anti-dilutive share repurchases) were $2.5 billion in 2022. On
  February 2, 2023, we declared a regular dividend of $0.15 per share and a supplemental dividend of $0.65 per share.

      We previously announced our plan for the global redesign of our business, pursuant to which we are working to turn
  around automotive operations, compete like a challenger, and capitalize on our strengths by allocating more capital, more
  resources, and more talent to our strongest businesses and vehicle franchises. The cash effect related to our global redesign
  activities was $3.9 billion through December 31, 2022.

  Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)


        Available Credit Lines. Total Company committed credit lines, excluding Ford Credit, at December 31, 2022 were $19.3
  billion, consisting of $13.5 billion of our corporate credit facility, $2.0 billion of our supplemental revolving credit facility, $1.75
  billion of our 364-day revolving credit facility, and $2.1 billion of local credit facilities. At December 31, 2022, the utilized
  portion of the corporate credit facility was $19 million, representing amounts utilized for letters of credit, and the full $1.75
  billion of our 364-day revolving credit facility was utilized by Ford Credit, in its capacity as a subsidiary borrower under that
  facility. In addition, $1.7 billion of committed Company credit lines, excluding Ford Credit, was utilized under local credit
  facilities for our affiliates as of December 31, 2022. As of January 25, 2023, Ford Credit had repaid the full $1.75 billion
  outstanding under the 364-day revolving credit facility.

      Lenders under our corporate credit facility have $3.4 billion of commitments maturing on June 23, 2025 and $10.1 billion
  of commitments maturing on June 23, 2027. Lenders under our supplemental revolving credit facility have $0.1 billion of
  commitments maturing on September 29, 2024 and $1.9 billion of commitments maturing on June 23, 2025. Lenders under
  our 364-day revolving credit facility have $1.75 billion of commitments maturing on June 22, 2023.

       The corporate, supplemental, and 364-day credit agreements include certain sustainability-linked targets, pursuant to
  which the applicable margin and facility fees may be adjusted if Ford achieves, or fails to achieve, the specified targets
  related to global manufacturing facility greenhouse gas emissions, renewable electricity consumption, and Ford Europe CO2
  tailpipe emissions. Ford outperformed the 2021 targets for all three of the sustainability-linked metrics, which impacted
  pricing beginning in the fourth quarter of 2022.

      The corporate credit facility is unsecured and free of material adverse change conditions to borrowing, restrictive
  financial covenants (for example, interest or fixed-charge coverage ratio, debt-to-equity ratio, and minimum net worth
  requirements), and credit rating triggers that could limit our ability to obtain funding or trigger early repayment. The corporate
  credit facility contains a liquidity covenant that requires us to maintain a minimum of $4 billion in aggregate of domestic cash,
  cash equivalents, and loaned and marketable securities and/or availability under the corporate credit facility, supplemental
  revolving credit facility, and 364-day revolving credit facility. The terms and conditions of the supplemental and 364-day
  revolving credit facilities are consistent with our corporate credit facility. Ford Credit has been designated as a subsidiary
  borrower under the corporate credit facility and the 364-day revolving credit facility.

      Each of the corporate credit facility, supplemental revolving credit facility, and 364-day revolving credit facility include a
  covenant that requires us to provide guarantees from certain of our subsidiaries in the event that our senior, unsecured, long-
  term debt does not maintain at least two investment grade ratings from Fitch, Moody’s, and S&P. The following subsidiaries
  have provided unsecured guarantees to the lenders under the credit facilities: Ford Component Sales, LLC; Ford European
  Holdings Inc.; Ford Global Technologies, LLC; Ford Holdings LLC (the parent company of Ford Credit); Ford International
  Capital LLC; Ford Mexico Holdings LLC; Ford Motor Service Company; Ford Next LLC; and Ford Trading Company, LLC.

      Debt. As shown in Note 19 of the Notes to the Financial Statements, at December 31, 2022, Company debt excluding
  Ford Credit was $19.9 billion. This balance is $400 million lower than at December 31, 2021, primarily reflecting the
  repayment in full of our $1.5 billion delayed draw term loan facility, repayment of the remaining $953 million under our Loan
  Arrangement and Reimbursement Agreement with the U.S. Department of Energy, a $1.1 billion redemption of higher
  coupon debt, and scheduled maturities, partially offset by the £750 million ($903 million as of December 31, 2022) draw on
  our U.K. Export Finance term loan credit facility and the issuance of our $1.8 billion green bond and $600 million retail bond.

      Leverage. We manage Company debt (excluding Ford Credit) levels with a leverage framework that targets investment
  grade credit ratings through a normal business cycle. The leverage framework includes a ratio of total Company debt
  (excluding Ford Credit), underfunded pension liabilities, operating leases, and other adjustments, divided by Company
  adjusted EBIT (excluding Ford Credit EBT), and further adjusted to exclude depreciation and tooling amortization (excluding
  Ford Credit).

       Ford Credit’s leverage is calculated as a separate business as described in the “Liquidity - Ford Credit Segment” section
  of Item 7. Ford Credit is self-funding and its debt, which is used to fund its operations, is separate from our Company debt
  excluding Ford Credit.

  Ford Credit Segment

      Ford Credit ended 2022 with $21 billion of liquidity. During the year, Ford Credit completed $16 billion of public term
  funding.

      Key elements of Ford Credit’s funding strategy include:

      •    Maintain strong liquidity and funding diversity
      •    Prudently access public markets
      •    Continue growth of retail deposits in Europe
      •    Flexibility to increase ABS mix as needed; preserving assets and committed capacity
      •    Target financial statement leverage of 9:1 to 10:1
      •    Maintain self-liquidating balance sheet

      Ford Credit’s liquidity profile continues to be diverse, robust, and focused on maintaining liquidity levels that meet its
  business and funding requirements. Ford Credit regularly stress tests its balance sheet and liquidity to ensure that it can
  continue to meet its financial obligations through economic cycles.

       Funding Sources. Ford Credit’s funding sources include primarily unsecured debt and securitization transactions
  (including other structured financings). Ford Credit issues both short-term and long-term debt that is held by both institutional
  and retail investors, with long-term debt having an original maturity of more than 12 months. Ford Credit sponsors a number
  of securitization programs that can be structured to provide both short-term and long-term funding through institutional
  investors and other financial institutions in the United States and international capital markets.

      Ford Credit obtains unsecured funding from the sale of demand notes under its Ford Interest Advantage program and
  through the retail deposit programs at FCE Bank plc (“FCE”) and Ford Bank GmbH (“Ford Bank”). At December 31, 2022,
  the principal amount outstanding of Ford Interest Advantage notes, which may be redeemed at any time at the option of the
  holders thereof without restriction, and FCE and Ford Bank deposits was $14.3 billion. Ford Credit maintains multiple
  sources of readily available liquidity to fund the payment of its unsecured short-term debt obligations.

  (a) See Definitions and Information Regarding Ford Credit Causal Factors section.


       Ford Credit’s net liquidity available for use will fluctuate quarterly based on factors including near-term debt maturities,
  receivable growth and decline, and timing of funding transactions. At December 31, 2022, Ford Credit’s net liquidity available
  for use was $21 billion, $11 billion lower than year-end 2021. Ford Credit’s net liquidity remains robust and aligns with lower
  near-term refinancing obligations. Ford Credit’s sources of liquidity include cash, committed asset-backed facilities, and
  unsecured credit facilities. At December 31, 2022, Ford Credit’s liquidity sources totaled $50.9 billion, down $1.3 billion from
  year-end 2021. Ford Credit continues to be well capitalized with a strong balance sheet.

       Material Cash Requirements. Ford Credit’s material cash requirements include: (1) the purchase of retail financing and
  operating lease contracts from dealers and providing wholesale financing for dealers to finance new and used vehicles; and
  (2) debt repayments (for additional information on debt, see the “Balance Sheet Liquidity Profile” section below, the “Material
  Cash Requirements” section in “Liquidity and Capital Resources - Company excluding Ford Credit” above, and Note 19 of
  the Notes to the Financial Statements). In addition, subject to approval by Ford Credit’s Board of Directors, shareholder
  distributions may require the expenditure of a material amount of cash. Moreover, Ford Credit may be subject to additional
  material cash requirements that are contingent upon the occurrence of certain events, e.g., legal contingencies, uncertain tax
  positions, and other matters.

     Ford Credit plans to utilize its liquidity (as described above) and its cash flows from business operations to fund its
  material cash requirements.

       Balance Sheet Liquidity Profile. Ford Credit defines its balance sheet liquidity profile as the cumulative maturities,
  including the impact of expected prepayments and allowance for credit losses, of its finance receivables, investment in
  operating leases, and cash, less the cumulative debt maturities over upcoming annual periods. Ford Credit’s balance sheet
  is inherently liquid because of the short-term nature of its finance receivables, investment in operating leases, and cash.
  Ford Credit ensures its cumulative debt maturities have a longer tenor than its cumulative asset maturities. This positive
  maturity profile is intended to provide Ford Credit with additional liquidity after all of its assets have been funded and is in
  addition to liquidity available to protect for stress scenarios.

     The following table shows Ford Credit’s cumulative maturities for assets and total debt for the periods presented and
  unsecured long-term debt maturities in the individual periods presented (in billions):
                                                                              2023                    2024                  2025            2026 and Beyond

  (a) Includes gross finance receivables less the allowance for credit losses (including certain finance receivables that are reclassified in consolidation to
      Trade and other receivables), investment in operating leases net of accumulated depreciation, cash and cash equivalents, and marketable securities
      (excluding amounts related to insurance activities). Amounts shown include the impact of expected prepayments.
  (b) Excludes unamortized debt (discount)/premium, unamortized issuance costs, and fair value adjustments.


      Maturities of investment in operating leases consist primarily of the portion of rental payments attributable to depreciation
  over the remaining life of the lease and the expected residual value at lease termination. Maturities of finance receivables
  and investment in operating leases in the table above include expected prepayments for Ford Credit’s retail installment sale
  contracts and investment in operating leases. The table above also reflects adjustments to debt maturities to match the
  asset-backed debt maturities with the underlying asset maturities.

      All wholesale securitization transactions and wholesale receivables are shown maturing in the next 12 months, even if
  the maturities extend beyond 2023. The retail securitization transactions under certain committed asset-backed facilities are
  assumed to amortize immediately rather than amortizing after the expiration of the commitment period. As of December 31,
  2022, Ford Credit had $137 billion of assets, $60 billion of which were unencumbered.

       Funding and Liquidity Risks. Ford Credit’s funding plan is subject to risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond
  its control, including disruption in the capital markets that could impact both unsecured debt and asset-backed securities and
  the effects of regulatory changes on the financial markets.

      Despite Ford Credit’s diverse sources of funding and liquidity, its ability to maintain liquidity may be affected by, among
  others, the following factors (not necessarily listed in order of importance or probability of occurrence):

            •     Prolonged disruption of the debt and securitization markets;
            •     Global capital market volatility;
            •     Credit ratings assigned to Ford and Ford Credit;
            •     Market capacity for Ford- and Ford Credit-sponsored investments;
            •     General demand for the type of securities Ford Credit offers;
            •     Ford Credit’s ability to continue funding through asset-backed financing structures;
            •     Performance of the underlying assets within Ford Credit’s asset-backed financing structures;
            •     Inability to obtain hedging instruments;
            •     Accounting and regulatory changes; and
            •     Ford Credit’s ability to maintain credit facilities and committed asset-backed facilities.

       Stress Tests. Ford Credit regularly conducts stress testing on its funding and liquidity sources to ensure it can continue
  to meet financial obligations and support the sale of Ford and Lincoln vehicles during firm-specific and market-wide stress
  events. Stress tests are intended to quantify the potential impact of various adverse scenarios on the balance sheet and
  liquidity. These scenarios include assumptions on access to unsecured and secured debt markets, runoff of short-term
  funding, and ability to renew expiring liquidity commitments and are measured over various time periods, including 30 days,
  90 days, and longer term. Ford Credit’s stress test does not assume any additional funding, liquidity, or capital support from
  Ford. Ford Credit routinely develops contingency funding plans as part of its liquidity stress testing.

       Pension Plan Contributions and Strategy. Our strategy is to reduce the risk of our funded defined benefit pension plans,
  including minimizing the volatility of the value of our pension assets relative to pension liabilities and the need for unplanned
  use of capital resources to fund the plans. The strategy reduces balance sheet, cash flow, and income exposures and, in
  turn, reduces our risk profile. Going forward, we expect to:

      •    Limit our pension contributions to offset ongoing service cost or meet regulatory requirements, if any;
      •    Minimize the volatility of the value of our pension assets relative to pension obligations and ensure assets are
           sufficient to pay plan benefits; and
      •    Evaluate strategic actions to reduce pension liabilities, such as plan design changes, curtailments, or settlements

      Worldwide, our defined benefit pension plans were underfunded by $0.2 billion at December 31, 2022, an improvement
  of $0.1 billion from December 31, 2021, primarily reflecting the impact of higher discount rates mostly offset by negative
  asset performance. Of the $0.2 billion underfunded status at year-end 2022, our funded plans were $4.1 billion overfunded
  and our unfunded plans were $4.3 billion underfunded. These unfunded plans are “pay as you go” with benefits paid from
  Company cash and primarily include certain plans in Germany and U.S. defined benefit plans for senior management.

      The fixed income mix was 79% in both our U.S. plans and non-U.S. plans at year-end 2022.

      In 2022, we contributed $567 million to our global funded pension plans, a decrease of $206 million compared with 2021.
  During 2023, we expect to contribute between $500 million and $600 million of cash to our global funded pension plans. We
  also expect to make about $400 million of benefit payments to participants in unfunded plans. Based on current assumptions
  and regulations, we do not expect to have a legal requirement to fund our major U.S. plans in 2023. Our global funded plans
  remain fully funded in aggregate, demonstrating the effectiveness of our de-risking strategy and our commitment to a strong
  balance sheet.

  Postretirement Employee Benefits” section of Item 7 of Part II of our 2022 Form 10-K Report and Note 17 of the Notes to the
  Financial Statements.

  CREDIT RATINGS

       Our short-term and long-term debt is rated by four credit rating agencies designated as nationally recognized statistical
  rating organizations (“NRSROs”) by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission: DBRS, Fitch, Moody’s, and S&P.

       In several markets, locally recognized rating agencies also rate us. A credit rating reflects an assessment by the rating
  agency of the credit risk associated with a corporate entity or particular securities issued by that entity. Rating agencies’
  ratings of us are based on information provided by us and other sources. Credit ratings are not recommendations to buy,
  sell, or hold securities and are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency. Each rating
  agency may have different criteria for evaluating company risk and, therefore, ratings should be evaluated independently for
  each rating agency.

     There have been no rating actions taken by these NRSROs since the filing of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the
  quarter ended September 30, 2022.

      The following table summarizes certain of the credit ratings and outlook presently assigned by these four NRSROs:

  OUTLOOK

      We provided 2023 Company guidance in our earnings release furnished on Form 8-K dated February 2, 2023. The
  guidance is based on our expectations as of February 2, 2023. Our actual results could differ materially from our guidance
  due to risks, uncertainties, and other factors, including those set forth in “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of Part I.
                                                                                                                                2023 Guidance
  Total Company
    Adjusted EBIT (a)                                                                                                           $9 - $11 billion
    Adjusted Free Cash Flow (a)                                                                                                 About $6 billion

  __________
  (a) When we provide guidance for Adjusted EBIT and Adjusted Free Cash Flow, we do not provide guidance for the most comparable GAAP measures
      because, as described in more detail below in “Non-GAAP Measures That Supplement GAAP Measures,” they include items that are difficult to predict
      with reasonable certainty.



      For full-year 2023, we expect adjusted EBIT of $9 billion to $11 billion, which assumes a seasonally adjusted annual rate
  (“SAAR”) of about 15 million in the United States and about 13 million in Europe. We also expect adjusted free cash flow of
  about $6 billion, which assumes no distributions from Ford Credit.

      Our outlook for 2023 assumes the headwinds and tailwinds below.

      Headwinds:
      • An expected mild U.S. recession and a moderate recession in Europe
      • Higher incentives across the industry as supply and demand come back into balance
      • Ford Credit EBT of about $1.3 billion, down about $1.4 billion, reflecting unfavorable lease residuals and credit
         losses and the non-recurrence of derivative gains
      • Continuation of the strong dollar
      • About $2 billion lower past service pension income
      • Continued investments in growth, including in customer experience, connected services, and capital expenditures

      Tailwinds:
      • Improvement in the supply chain and industry volume
      • Launch of our all-new Super Duty
      • Lower cost of goods sold, including efficiencies in materials, commodities, logistics, and other parts of our industrial

  Cautionary Note on Forward-Looking Statements

       Statements included or incorporated by reference herein may constitute “forward-looking statements” within the meaning
  of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements are based on expectations, forecasts,
  and assumptions by our management and involve a number of risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause actual
  results to differ materially from those stated, including, without limitation:

      •    Ford and Ford Credit’s financial condition and results of operations have been and may continue to be adversely
           affected by public health issues, including epidemics or pandemics such as COVID-19;
      •    Ford is highly dependent on its suppliers to deliver components in accordance with Ford’s production schedule and
           specifications, and a shortage of or inability to acquire key components, such as semiconductors, or raw materials,
           such as lithium, cobalt, nickel, graphite, and manganese, can disrupt Ford’s production of vehicles;
      •    To facilitate access to the raw materials necessary for the production of electric vehicles, Ford has entered into, and
           expects to continue to enter into, multi-year commitments to raw material suppliers that subject Ford to risks
           associated with lower future demand for such materials as well as costs that fluctuate and are difficult to accurately
           forecast;
      •    Ford’s long-term competitiveness depends on the successful execution of Ford+;
      •    Ford’s vehicles could be affected by defects that result in delays in new model launches, recall campaigns, or
           increased warranty costs;
      •    Ford may not realize the anticipated benefits of existing or pending strategic alliances, joint ventures, acquisitions,
           divestitures, restructurings, or new business strategies;
      •    Operational systems, security systems, vehicles, and services could be affected by cyber incidents, ransomware
           attacks, and other disruptions and impact Ford and Ford Credit as well as their suppliers and dealers;
      •    Ford’s production, as well as Ford’s suppliers’ production, and/or the ability to deliver products to consumers could
           be disrupted by labor issues, natural or man-made disasters, adverse effects of climate change, financial distress,
           production difficulties, capacity limitations, or other factors;
      •    Ford’s ability to maintain a competitive cost structure could be affected by labor or other constraints;
      •    Ford’s ability to attract and retain talented, diverse, and highly skilled employees is critical to its success and
           competitiveness;
      •    Ford’s new and existing products and digital, software, and physical services are subject to market acceptance and
           face significant competition from existing and new entrants in the automotive and digital and software services
           industries and its reputation may be harmed if it is unable to achieve the initiatives it has announced;
      •    Ford’s results are dependent on sales of larger, more profitable vehicles, particularly in the United States;
      •    With a global footprint, Ford’s results could be adversely affected by economic or geopolitical developments,
           including protectionist trade policies such as tariffs, or other events;
      •    Industry sales volume can be volatile and could decline if there is a financial crisis, recession, or significant
           geopolitical event;
      •    Ford may face increased price competition or a reduction in demand for its products resulting from industry excess
           capacity, currency fluctuations, competitive actions, or other factors;
      •    Inflationary pressure and fluctuations in commodity and energy prices, foreign currency exchange rates, interest
           rates, and market value of Ford or Ford Credit’s investments, including marketable securities, can have a significant
           effect on results;
      •    Ford and Ford Credit’s access to debt, securitization, or derivative markets around the world at competitive rates or
           in sufficient amounts could be affected by credit rating downgrades, market volatility, market disruption, regulatory
           requirements, or other factors;
      •    The impact of government incentives on Ford’s business could be significant, and Ford’s receipt of government
           incentives could be subject to reduction, termination, or clawback;
      •    Ford Credit could experience higher-than-expected credit losses, lower-than-anticipated residual values, or higher-
           than-expected return volumes for leased vehicles;
      •    Economic and demographic experience for pension and OPEB plans (e.g., discount rates or investment returns)
           could be worse than Ford has assumed;
      •    Pension and other postretirement liabilities could adversely affect Ford’s liquidity and financial condition;
      •    Ford and Ford Credit could experience unusual or significant litigation, governmental investigations, or adverse
           publicity arising out of alleged defects in products, services, perceived environmental impacts, or otherwise;
      •    Ford may need to substantially modify its product plans and facilities to comply with safety, emissions, fuel economy,
           autonomous driving technology, environmental, and other regulations;
      •    Ford and Ford Credit could be affected by the continued development of more stringent privacy, data use, and data
           protection laws and regulations as well as consumers’ heightened expectations to safeguard their personal
           information; and
      •    Ford Credit could be subject to new or increased credit regulations, consumer protection regulations, or other
           regulations.

  Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)


  NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES THAT SUPPLEMENT GAAP MEASURES

      We use both generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) and non-GAAP financial measures for operational and
  financial decision making, and to assess Company and segment business performance. The non-GAAP measures listed
  below are intended to be considered by users as supplemental information to their equivalent GAAP measures, to aid
  investors in better understanding our financial results. We believe that these non-GAAP measures provide useful perspective
  on underlying operating results and trends, and a means to compare our period-over-period results. These non-GAAP
  measures should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in
  accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP measures may not be the same as similarly titled measures used by other
  companies due to possible differences in method and in items or events being adjusted.

  •   Company Adjusted EBIT (Most Comparable GAAP Measure: Net Income/(Loss) Attributable to Ford) – Earnings before
      interest and taxes (EBIT) excludes interest on debt (excl. Ford Credit Debt), taxes, and pre-tax special items. This non-
      GAAP measure is useful to management and investors because it focuses on underlying operating results and trends,
      and improves comparability of our period-over-period results. Our management ordinarily excludes special items from its
      review of the results of the operating segments for purposes of measuring segment profitability and allocating resources.
      Our categories of pre-tax special items and the applicable significance guideline for each item (which may consist of a
      group of items related to a single event or action) are as follows:

       Pre-Tax Special Item                                                       Significance Guideline
       ∘ Pension and OPEB remeasurement gains and losses                          ∘ No minimum
       ∘ Gains and losses on investments in equity securities                     ∘ No minimum
       ∘ Personnel expenses, dealer-related costs, and facility-related           ∘ Generally $100 million or more
         charges stemming from our efforts to match production capacity
         and cost structure to market demand and changing model mix
       ∘ Other items that we do not necessarily consider to be indicative         ∘ $500 million or more for individual field
         of earnings from ongoing operating activities                              service actions; generally $100 million or
                                                                                    more for other items


      When we provide guidance for adjusted EBIT, we do not provide guidance on a net income basis because the GAAP
      measure will include potentially significant special items that have not yet occurred and are difficult to predict with
      reasonable certainty, including gains and losses on pension and OPEB remeasurements and on investments in equity
      securities.

  •   Company Adjusted EBIT Margin (Most Comparable GAAP Measure: Company Net Income/(Loss) Margin) – Company
      Adjusted EBIT margin is Company adjusted EBIT divided by Company revenue. This non-GAAP measure is useful to
      management and investors because it allows users to evaluate our operating results aligned with industry reporting.

  •   Adjusted Earnings/(Loss) Per Share (Most Comparable GAAP Measure: Earnings/(Loss) Per Share) – Measure of
      Company’s diluted net earnings/(loss) per share adjusted for impact of pre-tax special items (described above), tax
      special items, and restructuring impacts in noncontrolling interests. The measure provides investors with useful
      information to evaluate performance of our business excluding items not indicative of earnings from ongoing operating
      activities. When we provide guidance for adjusted earnings/(loss) per share, we do not provide guidance on an
      earnings/(loss) per share basis because the GAAP measure will include potentially significant special items that have not
      yet occurred and are difficult to predict with reasonable certainty prior to year-end, including pension and OPEB
      remeasurement gains and losses.

  •   Adjusted Effective Tax Rate (Most Comparable GAAP Measure: Effective Tax Rate) – Measure of Company’s tax rate
      excluding pre-tax special items (described above) and tax special items. The measure provides an ongoing effective rate
      which investors find useful for historical comparisons and for forecasting. When we provide guidance for adjusted
      effective tax rate, we do not provide guidance on an effective tax rate basis because the GAAP measure will include
      potentially significant special items that have not yet occurred and are difficult to predict with reasonable certainty prior to
      year-end, including pension and OPEB remeasurement gains and losses.


                                                                    76

26/04/23, 09:00                                                            f-20221231
  Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)


  •   Company Adjusted Free Cash Flow (Most Comparable GAAP Measure: Net Cash Provided By/(Used In) Operating
      Activities) – Measure of Company’s operating cash flow excluding Ford Credit’s operating cash flows. The measure
      contains elements management considers operating activities, including Company excluding Ford Credit capital
      spending, Ford Credit distributions to its parent, and settlement of derivatives. The measure excludes cash outflows for
      funded pension contributions, global redesign (including separations), and other items that are considered operating
      cash flows under U.S. GAAP. This measure is useful to management and investors because it is consistent with
      management’s assessment of the Company’s operating cash flow performance. When we provide guidance for
      Company adjusted free cash flow, we do not provide guidance for net cash provided by/(used in) operating activities
      because the GAAP measure will include items that are difficult to quantify or predict with reasonable certainty, including
      cash flows related to the Company's exposures to foreign currency exchange rates and certain commodity prices
      (separate from any related hedges), Ford Credit's operating cash flows, and cash flows related to special items,
      including separation payments, each of which individually or in the aggregate could have a significant impact to our net
      cash provided by/(used in) our operating activities.

  •   Adjusted ROIC – Calculated as the sum of adjusted net operating profit/(loss) after cash tax from the last four quarters,
      divided by the average invested capital over the last four quarters. Adjusted Return on Invested Capital (“Adjusted
      ROIC”) provides management and investors with useful information to evaluate the Company’s after-cash tax operating
      return on its invested capital for the period presented. Adjusted net operating profit/(loss) after cash tax measures
      operating results less special items, interest on debt (excl. Ford Credit Debt), and certain pension/OPEB costs. Average
      invested capital is the sum of average balance sheet equity, debt (excl. Ford Credit Debt), and net pension/OPEB
      liability.


                                                                    77

  Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)


  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

      We consider an accounting estimate to be critical if: (1) the accounting estimate requires us to make assumptions about
  matters that were highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made, and (2) changes in the estimate that are
  reasonably likely to occur from period to period, or use of different estimates that we reasonably could have used in the
  current period, would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations.

      Management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the Audit
  Committee of our Board of Directors. In addition, there are other items within our financial statements that require estimation,
  but are not deemed critical as defined above. Changes in estimates used in these and other items could have a material
  impact on our financial statements.

  Warranties and Field Service Actions

       Nature of Estimates Required. We provide base warranties on the products we sell for specific periods of time and/or
  mileage, which vary depending upon the type of product and the geographic location of its sale. Separately, we also
  periodically perform field service actions related to safety recalls, emission recalls, and other product campaigns. Pursuant to
  these warranties and field service actions, we will repair, replace, or adjust parts on a vehicle that are defective in factory-
  supplied materials or workmanship. We accrue the estimated cost of both base warranty coverages and field service actions
  at the time of sale. In addition, from time to time, we issue extended warranties at our expense, the estimated cost of which
  is accrued at the time of issuance.

      Assumptions and Approach Used. We establish our estimate of base warranty obligations using a patterned estimation
  model. We use historical information regarding the nature, frequency, and average cost of claims for each vehicle line by
  model year. We reevaluate our estimate of base warranty obligations on a regular basis. Experience has shown that initial
  data for any given model year may be volatile; therefore, our process relies on long-term historical averages until sufficient
  data are available. With actual experience, we use the data to update the historical averages. We then compare the resulting
  accruals with present spending rates to assess whether the balances are adequate to meet expected future obligations.
  Based on this data, we update our estimates as necessary.

       Field service actions may occur in periods beyond the base warranty coverage period. We establish our estimates of
  field service action obligations using a patterned estimation model. We use historical information regarding the nature,
  frequency, severity, and average cost of claims for each model year. We assess our obligation for field service actions on a
  regular basis using actual claims experience and update our estimates as necessary.

      Due to the uncertainty and potential volatility of the factors used in establishing our estimates, changes in our
  assumptions could materially affect our financial condition and results of operations. See Note 25 of the Notes to the
  Financial Statements for information regarding warranty and field service action costs.

  Pensions and Other Postretirement Employee Benefits

      Nature of Estimates Required. The estimation of our defined benefit pension and OPEB plan obligations and expenses
  requires that we make use of estimates of the present value of the projected future payments to all participants, taking into
  consideration the likelihood of potential future events, such as demographic experience and health care cost increases. Plan
  obligations and expenses are based on existing retirement plan provisions. No assumption is made regarding any potential
  future changes to benefit provisions beyond those to which we are presently committed (e.g., in existing labor contracts).


                                                                    84

26/04/23, 09:00                                                            f-20221231
  Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)


      Assumptions and Approach Used. The assumptions used in developing the required estimates include the following key
  factors:

      •    Discount rates. Our discount rate assumptions are based primarily on the results of cash flow matching analyses,
           which match the future cash outflows for each major plan to a yield curve based on high-quality bonds specific to the
           country of the plan. Benefit payments are discounted at the rates on the curve to determine the year-end obligations.

      •    Expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. Our expected long-term rate of return considers inputs from a
           range of advisors for capital market returns, inflation, bond yields, and other variables, adjusted for specific aspects
           of our investment strategy by plan. Historical returns also are considered when appropriate. The assumption is
           based on consideration of all inputs, with a focus on long-term trends to avoid short-term market influences.

      •    Salary growth. Our salary growth assumption reflects our actual experience, long-term outlook, and assumed
           inflation.

      •    Inflation. Our inflation assumption is based on an evaluation of external market indicators, including real gross
           domestic product growth and central bank inflation targets.

      •    Expected contributions. Our expected amount and timing of contributions are based on an assessment of minimum
           requirements, cash availability, and other considerations (e.g., funded status, avoidance of regulatory premiums and
           levies, and tax efficiency).

      •    Retirement rates. Retirement rates are developed to reflect actual and projected plan experience.

      •    Mortality rates. Mortality rates are developed to reflect actual and projected plan experience.

      •    Health care cost trends. Our health care cost trend assumptions are developed based on historical cost data, the
           near-term outlook, and an assessment of likely long-term trends.

     Assumptions are set at each year-end and are generally not changed during the year unless there is a major plan event,
  such as a curtailment or settlement that would trigger a plan remeasurement.

     See Note 17 of the Notes to the Financial Statements for more information regarding pension and OPEB costs and
  assumptions.

  Pension Plans

      Effect of Actual Results. The year-end 2022 weighted average discount rate was 5.51% for U.S. plans and 4.42% for
  non-U.S. plans, reflecting increases of 260 and 267 basis points, respectively, compared with year-end 2021. In 2022, the
  U.S. actual return on assets was negative 21.20%, which was lower than the expected long-term rate of return of 5.75%.
  Non-U.S. actual return on assets was negative 25.40%, which was lower than the expected long-term rate of return of
  3.29%. The lower returns are explained by losses on fixed income and growth assets, both of which were consistent with
  broader market performance. In total, higher rates and pension asset losses, in addition to demographic and other updates,
  resulted in a net remeasurement loss of $1.3 billion, which has been recognized within net periodic benefit cost and reported
  as a special item.

      For 2023, the expected long-term rate of return on assets is 6.25% for U.S. plans, up 50 basis points from 2022, and
  4.13% for non-U.S. plans, up 84 basis points compared with a year ago, reflecting higher nominal risk-free rates and a
  higher consensus on capital market return expectations from advisors.

       De-risking Strategy. We employ a broad de-risking strategy for our global funded plans that increases the matching
  characteristics of our assets relative to our obligation as funded status improves. Changes in interest rates, which directly
  influence changes in discount rates, in addition to other factors have a significant impact on the value of our pension
  obligation and fixed income asset portfolio. Our de-risking strategy has increased the allocation to fixed income investments
  and reduced our funded status sensitivity to changes in interest rates. Changes in interest rates should result in offsetting
  effects in the value of our pension obligation and the value of the fixed income asset portfolio.


                                                                    85

  Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)


      Sensitivity Analysis. The December 31, 2022 pension funded status and 2023 expense are affected by year-end 2022
  assumptions. Sensitivities to these assumptions may be asymmetric and are specific to the time periods noted. The effects
  of changes in the factors that generally have the largest impact on year-end funded status and pension expense are
  discussed below.

      Discount rates and interest rates have the largest impact on our obligations and fixed income assets. The table below
  estimates the effect on our funded status of an increase/decrease in discount rates and interest rates (in millions):
                                                                                                              Increase/(Decrease) in
                                                                                          Basis           December 31, 2022 Funded Status

  Factor                                                                                 Change            U.S. Plans        Non-U.S. Plans
  Discount rate - obligation                                                            +/- 100 bps      $2,700/$(3,200)     $2,500/$(3,100)
  Interest rate - fixed income assets                                                     +/- 100         (2,600)/3,100       (1,700)/2,000
    Net impact on funded status                                                                            $100/$(100)       $800/$(1,100)


      The fixed income asset sensitivity shown excludes other fixed income return components (e.g., changes in credit
  spreads, bond coupon and active management excess returns), and growth asset returns. Other factors that affect net
  funded status (e.g., contributions) are not reflected.

      Interest rates and the expected long-term rate of return on assets have the largest effect on pension expense. These
  assumptions are generally set at each year-end for expense recorded throughout the following year. The table below
  estimates the effect on pension expense of a higher/lower assumption for these factors (in millions):
                                                                                                               Increase/(Decrease) in
                                                                                          Basis                2023 Pension Expense
                                                                                          Point
  Factor                                                                                 Change            U.S. Plans        Non-U.S. Plans
  Interest rate - service cost and interest cost                                        +/- 25 bps          $25/$(25)           $10/$(10)
  Expected long-term rate of return on assets                                             +/- 25             (80)/80             (50)/50


     The effect of changing multiple factors simultaneously cannot be calculated by combining the individual sensitivities. The
  sensitivity of pension expense to a change in discount rate assumptions may not be linear.

  Other Postretirement Employee Benefits

      Effect of Actual Results. The weighted average discount rate used to determine the benefit obligation for worldwide
  OPEB plans at December 31, 2022 was 5.48%, compared with 2.97% at December 31, 2021, resulting in a worldwide net
  remeasurement gain of $1.3 billion, which has been recognized within net periodic benefit cost and reported as a special
  item.

      Sensitivity Analysis. Discount rates and interest rates have the largest effect on our OPEB obligation and expense. The
  table below estimates the effect on 2023 OPEB expense of higher/lower assumptions for these factors (in millions):
                                                                                                                 Worldwide OPEB

  Income Taxes

      Nature of Estimates Required. We must make estimates and apply judgment in determining the provision for income
  taxes for financial reporting purposes. We make these estimates and judgments primarily in the following areas: (i) the
  calculation of tax credits, (ii) the calculation of differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax
  reporting and financial statement purposes, as well as (iii) the calculation of interest and penalties related to uncertain tax
  positions. Changes in these estimates and judgments may result in a material increase or decrease to our tax provision,

       Assumptions and Approach Used. We are subject to the income tax laws and regulations of the many jurisdictions in
  which we operate. These tax laws and regulations are complex and involve uncertainties in the application to our facts and
  circumstances that may be open to interpretation. We recognize benefits for these uncertain tax positions based upon a
  process that requires judgment regarding the technical application of the laws, regulations, and various related judicial
  opinions. If, in our judgment, it is more likely than not (defined as a likelihood of more than 50%) that the uncertain tax
  position will be settled favorably for us, we estimate an amount that ultimately will be realized. This process is inherently
  subjective since it requires our assessment of the probability of future outcomes. We evaluate these uncertain tax positions
  on a quarterly basis, including consideration of changes in facts and circumstances, such as new regulations or recent
  judicial opinions, as well as the status of audit activities by taxing authorities. Changes to our estimate of the amount to be
  realized are recorded in our provision for income taxes during the period in which the change occurred.

      We must also assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets against future sources of
  taxable income and reduce the carrying amount of deferred tax assets by recording a valuation allowance if, based on all
  available evidence, it is more likely than not that all or a portion of such assets will not be realized.

       This assessment, which is completed on a taxing jurisdiction basis, takes into account various types of evidence,
  including the following:

      •    Nature, frequency, and severity of current and cumulative financial reporting losses. A pattern of objectively
           measured recent financial reporting losses is heavily weighted as a source of negative evidence. We generally
           consider cumulative pre-tax losses in the three-year period ending with the current quarter to be significant negative
           evidence regarding future profitability. We also consider the strength and trend of earnings, as well as other relevant
           factors. In certain circumstances, historical information may not be as relevant due to changes in our business
           operations;

      •    Sources of future taxable income. Future reversals of existing temporary differences are heavily weighted sources of
           objectively verifiable positive evidence. Projections of future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary
           differences are a source of positive evidence only when the projections are combined with a history of recent profits
           and can be reasonably estimated. Otherwise, these projections are considered inherently subjective and generally
           will not be sufficient to overcome negative evidence that includes relevant cumulative losses in recent years,
           particularly if the projected future taxable income is dependent on an anticipated turnaround to profitability that has
           not yet been achieved. In such cases, we generally give these projections of future taxable income no weight for the
           purposes of our valuation allowance assessment; and

      •    Tax planning strategies. If necessary and available, tax planning strategies could be implemented to accelerate
           taxable amounts to utilize expiring carryforwards. These strategies would be a source of additional positive evidence
           and, depending on their nature, could be heavily weighted.

       In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, we consider the trade-offs between cash preservation and cash
  outlays to preserve tax credits. During 2022, we reversed $405 million of U.S. valuation allowances primarily as a result of
  planning actions. We presently believe that global valuation allowances of $822 million are required and that we ultimately
  will recover the remaining $14 billion of deferred tax assets. However, the ultimate realization of our deferred tax assets is
  subject to a number of variables, including our future profitability within relevant tax jurisdictions, and future tax planning and
  the related effects on our cash and liquidity position. Accordingly, our valuation allowances may increase or decrease in
  future periods.

      For additional information regarding income taxes, see Note 7 of the Notes to the Financial Statements.

  Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)


  Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

      Asset groups are tested at the level of the smallest identifiable group of assets that generate cash inflows that are largely
  independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets. Our asset groups presently are the regional
  Automotive business units (i.e., North America, South America, Europe, China (including Taiwan), and the International
  Markets Group), Ford Credit, and the separate legal entities within the Mobility segment. Asset groupings for impairment
  analysis are reevaluated when events occur, such as changes in organizational structure and management reporting. As a
  result of the new organizational and segment structure that will be implemented in 2023, our asset groups are expected to be
  Ford Blue North America, Ford Blue Europe, Ford Blue Rest of World, Ford Model e, Ford Pro, Ford Credit, and Ford Next
  (formerly Mobility).

       Nature of Estimates Required - Held-and-Used Long-Lived Assets. We test our long-lived asset groups when changes in
  circumstances indicate their carrying value may not be recoverable. Events that trigger a test for recoverability include
  material adverse changes in projected revenues or expenses, present cash flow losses combined with a history of cash flow
  losses and a forecast that demonstrates significant continuing losses, significant negative industry or economic trends
  (including a substantial shift in consumer preference), a current expectation that a long-lived asset group will be disposed of
  significantly before the end of its useful life, a significant adverse change in the manner in which an asset group is used or in
  its physical condition, or when there is a change in the asset grouping. In addition, investing in new, emerging products (e.g.,
  EVs) or services (e.g., connectivity) may require substantial upfront investment, which may result in initial forecasted
  negative cash flows in the near term. In these instances, near term negative cash flows on their own may not be indicative of
  a triggering event for evaluation of impairment. In such circumstances we also conduct a qualitative evaluation of the
  business growth trajectory, which includes updating our assessment of when positive cash flows are expected to be
  generated, confirming whether established milestones are being achieved, and assessing our ability and intent to continue to
  access required funding to execute the plan. If this evaluation indicates a triggering event has occurred, a test for
  recoverability is performed.

       When a triggering event occurs, a test for recoverability is performed, comparing projected undiscounted future cash
  flows to the carrying value of the asset group. If the undiscounted forecasted cash flows are less than the carrying value of
  the assets, the asset group’s fair value is measured relying primarily on a discounted cash flow method. To the extent
  available, we will also consider third-party valuations of our long-lived assets that were prepared for other business
  purposes. An impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying value of the asset group exceeds its
  estimated fair value. When an impairment loss is recognized for assets to be held and used, the adjusted carrying amounts
  of those assets are depreciated over their remaining useful life.

      Nature of Estimates Required - Held-for-Sale Operations. We perform an impairment test on a disposal group to be
  discontinued, held for sale, or otherwise disposed of when we have committed to an action and the action is expected to be
  completed within one year. We estimate fair value to approximate the expected proceeds to be received less cost to sell and
  compare it to the carrying value of the disposal group. An impairment charge is recognized when the carrying value exceeds
  the estimated fair value.

      Assumptions and Approach Used - Held-and-Used Long-Lived Assets. Fair value of an asset group is determined from
  the perspective of a market-participant considering, among other things, appropriate discount rates, valuation techniques,
  the most advantageous market, and assumptions about the highest and best use of the asset group.

       We measure the fair value of an asset group based on market prices (i.e., the amount for which the asset could be sold
  to a third party) when available. When market prices are not available, we generally estimate the fair value of the asset group
  using the income approach and/or the market approach. The income approach uses cash flow projections. Inherent in our
  development of cash flow projections are assumptions and estimates derived from a review of our operating results,
  business plan forecasts, expected growth rates, and cost of capital, similar to those a market participant would use to assess
  fair value. We also make certain assumptions about future economic conditions and other data. Many of the factors used in
  assessing fair value are outside the control of management, and these assumptions and estimates may change in future
  periods.

      Changes in assumptions or estimates can materially affect the fair value measurement of an asset group and, therefore,
  can affect the test results. The following are key assumptions we use in making cash flow projections:

      •    Business projections. We make assumptions about the demand for our products in the marketplace. These
           assumptions drive our planning assumptions for volume, mix, and pricing. We also make assumptions about our
           cost levels (e.g., capacity utilization, cost performance). These projections are derived using our internal business
           plan forecasts that are updated at least annually and reviewed by our Board of Directors.


                                                                    88

26/04/23, 09:00                                                            f-20221231
  Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)


      •    Long-term growth rate. A growth rate is used to calculate the terminal value of the business and is added to the
           present value of the debt-free interim cash flows. The growth rate is the expected rate at which an asset group’s
           business unit’s earnings stream is projected to grow beyond the planning period.

      •    Discount rate. When measuring possible impairment, future cash flows are discounted at a rate that is consistent
           with a weighted-average cost of capital that we anticipate a potential market participant would use. Weighted-
           average cost of capital is an estimate of the overall risk-adjusted pre-tax rate of return expected by equity and debt
           holders of a business enterprise.

      •    Economic projections. Assumptions regarding general economic conditions are included in and affect our
           assumptions regarding industry sales and pricing estimates for our vehicles. These macroeconomic assumptions
           include, but are not limited to, industry sales volumes, inflation, interest rates, prices of raw materials (e.g.,
           commodities), and foreign currency exchange rates.

       The market approach is another method for measuring the fair value of a reporting unit or asset group. This approach
  relies on the market value (i.e., market capitalization) of companies that are engaged in the same or similar line of business
  as the reporting unit or asset group being evaluated. In addition, to the extent available we also consider third-party
  valuations that were prepared for other business purposes.

       During 2022, we continued to progress our global redesign. Against this backdrop, we determined that there were
  triggering events related to our South America and International Markets Group (“IMG”) business units. We also assessed
  our expected new 2023 asset groups, which consist of Ford Blue North America, Ford Blue Europe, Ford Blue Rest of World,
  Ford Model e, Ford Pro, Ford Credit and Ford Next and assessed these groups for triggering events and potential
  impairment. We determined that the carrying values of the long-lived assets were recoverable at December 31, 2022 under
  our existing assets groups as well as under our anticipated 2023 asset groups. If in future quarters our economic or business
  projections were to change as a result of our plans or changes in the economic or business environment, there was a
  significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a long-lived asset is being used, or there was a current
  expectation that a long-lived asset group will be disposed of significantly before the end of its useful life, we would undertake
  additional testing, as appropriate, which could result in an impairment of long-lived assets.

      Assumptions and Approach Used - Held-for-Sale Operations. In the third quarter of 2022, we entered into an agreement
  to sell our Sanand, India vehicle assembly and powertrain plants to Tata Passenger Electric Mobility Limited (“Tata”). The
  sale transaction included the land, buildings, and other fixed assets (excluding the powertrain machinery and equipment) for
  the plants. Accordingly, we have reported $88 million of fixed assets for this operation as held for sale for the period ended
  December 31, 2022. We recognized pre-tax impairment charges in Cost of sales of $32 million in the third quarter of 2022 to
  adjust the carrying value of the held-for-sale assets to fair value less costs to sell. We determined fair value using the market
  approach, estimated based on the negotiated value of the assets. On January 10, 2023, we completed the sale of the plants
  to Tata. See Note 22 of the Notes to the Financial Statements for more information regarding held-for-sale operations.

  Allowance for Credit Losses

      The allowance for credit losses represents Ford Credit’s estimate of the expected lifetime credit losses inherent in
  finance receivables as of the balance sheet date. The adequacy of Ford Credit’s allowance for credit losses is assessed
  quarterly, and the assumptions and models used in establishing the allowance are evaluated regularly. Because credit losses
  can vary substantially over time, estimating credit losses requires a number of assumptions about matters that are uncertain.
  Changes in assumptions affect Ford Credit interest, operating, and other expenses on our consolidated income statements
  and the allowance for credit losses contained within Ford Credit finance receivables, net on our consolidated balance sheets.
  See Note 10 of the Notes to the Financial Statements for more information regarding allowance for credit losses.

      Nature of Estimates Required. Ford Credit estimates the allowance for credit losses for receivables that share similar risk
  characteristics based on a collective assessment using a combination of measurement models and management judgment.
  The models consider factors such as historical trends in credit losses, recent portfolio performance, and forward-looking
  macroeconomic conditions. The models vary by portfolio and receivable type including consumer finance receivables,
  wholesale loans, and dealer loans. If Ford Credit does not believe the models reflect lifetime expected credit losses for the
  portfolio, an adjustment is made to reflect management judgment regarding qualitative factors including economic
  uncertainty, observable changes in portfolio performance, and other relevant factors.




                                                                    89

  Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)


       Assumptions Used. Ford Credit’s allowance for credit losses is based on its assumptions regarding:

       •    Probability of default. The expected probability of payment and time to default, which include assumptions about
            macroeconomic factors and recent performance; and
       •    Loss given default. The percentage of the expected balance due at default that is not recoverable. The loss given
            default takes into account expected collateral value and future recoveries.

      Macroeconomic factors used in Ford Credit’s models are country specific and include variables such as unemployment
  rates, personal bankruptcy filings, housing prices, and gross domestic product.

       Sensitivity Analysis. Changes in the probability of default and loss given default assumptions would affect the allowance
  for credit losses. The effect of the indicated increase/decrease in the assumptions for Ford Credit’s U.S. Ford and Lincoln
  retail financing is as follows (in millions):
                                                                                                   Basis Point

  Probability of default (lifetime)                                                                 +/- 100 bps       $210/$(210)
  Loss given default                                                                                  +/- 100           10/(10)


  Accumulated Depreciation on Vehicles Subject to Operating Leases

      Accumulated depreciation on vehicles subject to operating leases reduces the value of the leased vehicles in Ford
  Credit’s operating lease portfolio from their original acquisition value to their expected residual value at the end of the lease
  term.

      Ford Credit monitors residual values each month, and it reviews the adequacy of accumulated depreciation on a
  quarterly basis. If Ford Credit believes that the expected residual values for its vehicles have changed, it revises depreciation
  to ensure that net investment in operating leases (equal to the acquisition value of the vehicles less accumulated
  depreciation) will be adjusted to reflect Ford Credit’s revised estimate of the expected residual value at the end of the lease
  term. Adjustments to depreciation expense result in a change in the depreciation rates of the vehicles subject to operating
  leases and are recorded prospectively on a straight-line basis.

      Generally, lease customers have the option to buy the leased vehicle at the end of the lease or to return the vehicle to
  the dealer.

      Nature of Estimates Required. Each operating lease in Ford Credit’s portfolio represents a vehicle it owns that has been
  leased to a customer. At the time Ford Credit purchases a lease, it establishes an expected residual value for the vehicle.
  Ford Credit estimates the expected residual value by evaluating recent auction values, return volumes for its leased vehicles,
  industrywide used vehicle prices, marketing incentive plans, and vehicle quality data.

     Assumptions Used. Ford Credit’s accumulated depreciation on vehicles subject to operating leases is based on
  assumptions regarding:

       •    Auction value. Ford Credit’s projection of the market value of the vehicles when sold at the end of the lease; and
       •    Return volume. Ford Credit’s projection of the number of vehicles that will be returned at lease-end.

      See Note 12 of the Notes to the Financial Statements for more information regarding accumulated depreciation on
  vehicles subject to operating leases.




                                                                    90

  Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)


       Sensitivity Analysis. For returned vehicles, Ford Credit faces a risk that the amount it obtains from the vehicle sold at
  auction will be less than its estimate of the expected residual value for the vehicle. The impact of the change in assumptions
  on future auction values and return volumes would increase or decrease accumulated supplemental depreciation and
  depreciation expense over the remaining terms of the operating leases; however, the impact may be tempered or
  exacerbated based on future auction values in relation to the purchase price specified in the lease contract. A change in the
  assumption for an auction value will impact Ford Credit’s estimate of accumulated supplemental depreciation if the future
  auction value is lower than the purchase price specified in the lease contract. The effect of the indicated increase/decrease
  in the assumptions for Ford Credit’s U.S. Ford and Lincoln operating lease portfolio is as follows (in millions):
                                                                                                 Basis Point
  Assumption                                                                                      Change       Increase/(Decrease)
  Future auction values                                                                          +/- 100 bps        $(10)/$10
  Return volumes                                                                                   +/- 100            5/(5)


     Adjustments to the amount of accumulated supplemental depreciation on operating leases are reflected on our balance
  sheets as Net investment in operating leases and on our income statements in Ford Credit interest, operating, and other
  expenses.

  ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

  OVERVIEW

      We are exposed to a variety of market and other risks, including the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange
  rates, commodity prices, and interest rates, as well as risks to availability of funding sources, hazard events, and specific
  asset risks.

       These risks affect our Automotive and Ford Credit segments differently. We monitor and manage these exposures as an
  integral part of our overall risk management program, which includes regular reports to a central management committee,
  the Global Risk Management Committee (“GRMC”). The GRMC is chaired by our Chief Financial Officer, and the committee
  includes our Controller and Treasurer.

      Our Automotive and Ford Credit segments are exposed to liquidity risk, including the possibility of having to curtail
  business or being unable to meet financial obligations as they come due because funding sources may be reduced or
  become unavailable. Our plan is to maintain funding sources to ensure liquidity through a variety of economic or business
  cycles. As discussed in greater detail in Item 7, our funding sources include sales of receivables in securitizations and other
  structured financings, unsecured debt issuances, equity and equity-linked issuances, and bank borrowings.

      We are exposed to a variety of risks, such as loss or damage to property, liability claims, and employee injury. We
  protect against these risks through the purchase of commercial insurance that is designed to protect us above our self-
  insured retentions against events that could generate significant losses.

      Direct responsibility for the execution of our market risk management strategies resides with our Treasurer’s Office and
  is governed by written policies and procedures. Separation of duties is maintained between the development and
  authorization of derivative trades, the transaction of derivatives, and the settlement of cash flows. Regular audits are
  conducted to ensure that appropriate controls are in place and that they remain effective. In addition, our market risk
  exposures and our use of derivatives to manage these exposures are approved by the GRMC, and reviewed by the Audit
  Committee of our Board of Directors.

      In accordance with our corporate risk management policies, we use derivative instruments, when available, such as
  forward contracts, swaps, and options that economically hedge certain exposures (foreign currency, commodity, and interest
  rates). We do not use derivative contracts for trading, market-making, or speculative purposes. In certain instances, we forgo
  hedge accounting, and in certain other instances, our derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting. Either situation results
  in unrealized gains and losses that are recognized in income. For additional information on our derivatives, see Note 20 of
  the Notes to the Financial Statements.

      The market and counterparty risks of our Automotive and Ford Credit segments are discussed and quantified below.

  AUTOMOTIVE MARKET RISK

       Our Automotive segment frequently has expenditures and receipts denominated in foreign currencies, including the
  following: purchases and sales of finished vehicles and production parts, debt and other payables, subsidiary dividends, and
  investments in foreign operations. These expenditures and receipts create exposures to changes in exchange rates. We also
  are exposed to changes in prices of commodities used in the production of our vehicles and changes in interest rates.

     Foreign currency risk, commodity risk, and interest rate risk are measured and quantified using a model to evaluate the
  sensitivity of market value to instantaneous, parallel shifts in rates and/or prices.

       Foreign Currency Risk. Foreign currency risk is the possibility that our financial results could be worse than planned
  because of changes in currency exchange rates. Accordingly, our practice is to use derivative instruments to hedge our
  economic exposure with respect to forecasted revenues and costs, assets, liabilities, and firm commitments denominated in
  certain foreign currencies consistent with our overall risk management strategy. In our hedging actions, we use derivative
  instruments commonly used by corporations to reduce foreign exchange risk (e.g., forward contracts).

  Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued)


       The net fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts (including adjustments for credit risk) as of December 31, 2022,
  was an asset of $236 million, compared with a liability of $253 million as of December 31, 2021. The potential change in the
  fair value from a 10% change in the underlying exchange rates, in U.S. dollar terms, would have been $1.9 billion at
  December 31, 2022, compared with $2.2 billion at December 31, 2021. The sensitivity analysis presented is hypothetical and
  assumes foreign exchange rate changes are instantaneous and adverse across all currencies. In reality, some of our
  exposures offset and foreign exchange rates move in different magnitudes and at different times, and any changes in fair
  value would generally be offset by changes in the underlying exposure. See Note 20 of the Notes to the Financial
  Statements for more information regarding our foreign currency exchange contracts.

       Commodity Price Risk. Commodity price risk is the possibility that our financial results could be worse than planned
  because of changes in the prices of commodities used in the production of motor vehicles, such as base metals (e.g., steel,
  copper, and aluminum), precious metals (e.g., palladium), energy (e.g., natural gas and electricity), and plastics/resins (e.g.,
  polypropylene). As we transition to a greater mix of electric vehicles, we expect to increase our reliance on lithium, cobalt,
  nickel, graphite, and manganese, among other materials, for batteries. Accordingly, our practice is to use derivative
  instruments to hedge the price risk with respect to forecasted purchases of certain commodities that we can economically
  hedge and consistent with our overall risk management strategy. In our hedging actions, we use derivative instruments
  commonly used by corporations to reduce commodity price risk (e.g., financially settled forward contracts). The extent to
  which we hedge is also impacted by our ability to achieve designated hedge accounting.

       The net fair value of commodity forward contracts (including adjustments for credit risk) as of December 31, 2022, was a
  liability of $49 million, compared with an asset of $220 million as of December 31, 2021. The potential change in the fair
  value from a 10% change in the underlying commodity prices would have been $178 million at December 31, 2022,
  compared with $215 million at December 31, 2021. The sensitivity analysis presented is hypothetical and assumes
  commodity price changes are instantaneous and adverse across all commodities. In reality, commodity prices move in
  different magnitudes and at different times, and any changes in fair value would generally be offset by changes in the
  underlying exposure.

      In addition, our purchasing organization (with guidance from the GRMC, as appropriate) negotiates contracts for the
  continuous supply of raw materials. In some cases, these contracts stipulate minimum purchase amounts and specific
  prices, and, therefore, play a role in managing commodity price risk.

      Interest Rate Risk. Interest rate risk relates to the loss we could incur in our Company cash investment portfolios due to
  a change in interest rates. Our interest rate sensitivity analysis on the investment portfolios includes cash and cash
  equivalents and net marketable securities. At December 31, 2022, Company cash consisted of $0.2 billion of Rivian
  marketable securities and $32.1 billion of cash in our investment portfolios, compared to $10.6 billion of Rivian marketable
  securities and $26.0 billion of cash in our investment portfolios at December 31, 2021. We invest the portfolios in securities
  of various types and maturities, the value of which are subject to fluctuations in interest rates. The investment strategy is
  based on clearly defined risk and liquidity guidelines to maintain liquidity, minimize risk, and earn a reasonable return on the
  short-term investments. In investing the cash in our investment portfolios, safety of principal is the primary objective and risk-
  adjusted return is the secondary objective.

       At any time, a rise in interest rates could have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our portfolios. Assuming a
  hypothetical increase in interest rates of one percentage point, the value of our portfolios would be reduced by $256 million,
  as calculated as of December 31, 2022. This compares to $250 million, as calculated as of December 31, 2021. While these
  are our best estimates of the impact of the specified interest rate scenario, actual results could differ from those projected.
  The sensitivity analysis presented assumes interest rate changes are instantaneous, parallel shifts in the yield curve. In
  reality, interest rate changes of this magnitude are rarely instantaneous or parallel.

  Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued)


  FORD CREDIT MARKET RISK

     Market risk for Ford Credit is the possibility that changes in interest and currency exchange rates will adversely affect
  cash flow and economic value.

     Interest Rate Risk. Generally, Ford Credit’s assets and the related debt have different re-pricing periods, and
  consequently, respond differently to changes in interest rates.

      Ford Credit’s assets consist primarily of fixed-rate retail financing and operating lease contracts and floating-rate
  wholesale receivables. Fixed-rate retail financing and operating lease contracts generally require customers to make equal
  monthly payments over the life of the contract. Wholesale receivables are originated to finance new and used vehicles held
  in dealers’ inventory and generally require dealers to pay a floating rate.

      Debt consists primarily of short- and long-term unsecured and securitized debt. Ford Credit’s term debt instruments are
  principally fixed-rate and require fixed and equal interest payments over the life of the instrument and a single principal
  payment at maturity.

      Ford Credit’s interest rate risk management objective is to reduce volatility in its cash flows and volatility in its economic
  value from changes in interest rates based on an established risk tolerance that may vary by market. Ford Credit uses
  economic value sensitivity analysis and re-pricing gap analysis to evaluate potential long-term effects of changes in interest
  rates. It then enters into interest rate swaps to convert portions of its floating-rate debt to fixed or its fixed-rate debt to floating
  to ensure that Ford Credit’s exposure falls within the established tolerances. Ford Credit also uses pre-tax cash flow
  sensitivity analysis to monitor the level of near-term cash flow exposure. The pre-tax cash flow sensitivity analysis measures
  the changes in expected cash flows associated with Ford Credit’s interest-rate-sensitive assets, liabilities, and derivative
  financial instruments from hypothetical changes in interest rates over a twelve-month horizon. Interest rate swaps are placed
  to maintain exposure within approved thresholds and the Asset-Liability Committee reviews the re-pricing mismatch monthly.

       To provide a quantitative measure of the sensitivity of its pre-tax cash flow to changes in interest rates, Ford Credit uses
  interest rate scenarios that assume a hypothetical, instantaneous increase or decrease of one percentage point in all interest
  rates across all maturities (a “parallel shift”), as well as a base case that assumes that all interest rates remain constant at
  existing levels. In reality, interest rate changes are rarely instantaneous or parallel and rates could move more or less than
  the one percentage point assumed in Ford Credit’s analysis. As a result, the actual impact to pre-tax cash flow could be
  higher or lower than the results detailed in the table below. These interest rate scenarios are purely hypothetical and do not
  represent Ford Credit’s view of future interest rate movements.

      Under these interest rate scenarios, Ford Credit expects more assets than debt and liabilities to re-price in the next
  twelve months. Other things being equal, this means that during a period of rising interest rates, the interest received on
  Ford Credit’s assets will increase more than the interest paid on Ford Credit’s debt, thereby initially increasing Ford Credit’s
  pre-tax cash flow. During a period of falling interest rates, Ford Credit would expect its pre-tax cash flow to initially decrease.
  Ford Credit’s pre-tax cash flow sensitivity to interest rate movement at December 31 was as follows (in millions):
  Pre-Tax Cash Flow Sensitivity                                                                                              2021                 2022
  One percentage point instantaneous increase in interest rates                                                       $              (76)   $            127
  One percentage point instantaneous decrease in interest rates (a)                                                                  76                  (127)

  __________
  (a) Pre-tax cash flow sensitivity given a one percentage point decrease in interest rates requires an assumption of negative interest rates in markets where
      existing interest rates are below one percent.


      While the sensitivity analysis presented is Ford Credit’s best estimate of the impacts of the specified assumed interest
  rate scenarios, its actual results could differ from those projected. The model Ford Credit uses to conduct this analysis is
  heavily dependent on assumptions. Embedded in the model are assumptions regarding the reinvestment of maturing asset
  principal, refinancing of maturing debt, replacement of maturing derivatives, exercise of options embedded in debt and
  derivatives, and predicted repayment of retail financing and operating lease contracts ahead of contractual maturity. Ford
  Credit’s repayment projections ahead of contractual maturity are based on historical experience. If interest rates or other
  factors change, Ford Credit’s actual prepayment experience could be different than projected.


                                                                              95

26/04/23, 09:00                                                            f-20221231
  Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued)


       Foreign Currency Risk. Ford Credit’s policy is to minimize exposure to changes in currency exchange rates. To meet
  funding objectives, Ford Credit borrows in a variety of currencies, principally U.S. dollars, Canadian dollars, euros, sterling,
  and renminbi. Ford Credit faces exposure to currency exchange rates if a mismatch exists between the currency of
  receivables and the currency of the debt funding those receivables. When possible, receivables are funded with debt in the
  same currency, minimizing exposure to exchange rate movements. When a different currency is used, Ford Credit may use
  foreign currency swaps and foreign currency forwards to convert substantially all of its foreign currency debt obligations to
  the local country currency of the receivables. As a result of this policy, Ford Credit believes its market risk exposure, relating
  to changes in currency exchange rates at December 31, 2022, is insignificant.

       Derivative Fair Values. The net fair value of Ford Credit’s derivative financial instruments at December 31, 2022 was a
  liability of $2.0 billion, compared to an asset of $553 million at December 31, 2021. The decline in net fair value was driven
  by higher U.S. interest rates and a stronger U.S. dollar.

  COUNTERPARTY RISK

      Counterparty risk relates to the loss we could incur if an obligor or counterparty defaulted on an investment or a
  derivative contract. We enter into master agreements with counterparties that allow netting of certain exposures in order to
  manage this risk. Exposures primarily relate to investments in fixed income instruments and derivative contracts used for
  managing interest rate, foreign currency exchange rate, and commodity price risk. We, together with Ford Credit, establish
  exposure limits for each counterparty to minimize risk and provide counterparty diversification.

      Our approach to managing counterparty risk is forward-looking and proactive, allowing us to take risk mitigation actions
  before risks become losses. Exposure limits are established based on our overall risk tolerance, which is calculated from
  counterparty credit ratings and market-based credit default swap (“CDS”) spreads. The exposure limits are lower for smaller
  and lower-rated counterparties, counterparties that have relatively higher CDS spreads, and for longer dated exposures. Our
  exposures are monitored on a regular basis and included in periodic reports to our Treasurer.

      Substantially all of our counterparty exposures are with counterparties that have an investment grade rating. Investment
  grade is our guideline for minimum counterparty long-term ratings.

  ITEM 9A. Controls and Procedures.

      Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. James D. Farley, Jr., our Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”), and John T.
  Lawler, our Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”), have performed an evaluation of the Company’s disclosure controls and
  procedures, as that term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended
  (“Exchange Act”), as of December 31, 2022, and each has concluded that such disclosure controls and procedures are
  effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our periodic reports filed under the Exchange Act is recorded,
  processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified by SEC rules and forms, and that such information is
  accumulated and communicated to the CEO and CFO to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.

      Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our management is responsible for establishing and
  maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f) or 15d-
  15(f). The Company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance
  regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance
  with generally accepted accounting principles.

      Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
  Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
  inadequate because of changes in conditions or because the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may
  deteriorate.

       Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our CEO and CFO, we conducted an
  assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. The assessment
  was based on criteria established in the framework Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013), issued by the Committee
  of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this assessment, management concluded that our
  internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2022.

       The effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 has been audited
  by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PCAOB ID 238), an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in its report
  included herein.

       Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. There were no changes in internal control over financial reporting
  during the quarter ended December 31, 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our
  internal control over financial reporting.

                                   Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

  To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Ford Motor Company

  Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting

  We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Ford Motor Company and its subsidiaries
  (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the related consolidated statements of income, of comprehensive
  income, of equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, including the related
  notes and financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(2) (collectively referred to as the
  “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of
  December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the
  Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

  In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
  position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of
  the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
  United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control
  over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework
  (2013) issued by the COSO.

  Change in Accounting Principle

  As discussed in Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for
  credit losses in 2020.

  Basis for Opinions

  The Company’s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal
  control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting,
  included in Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility
  is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over
  financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting
  Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance
  with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission
  and the PCAOB.

  We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and
  perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material
  misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in
  all material respects.

  Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material
  misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that
  respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and
  disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and
  significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial
  statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over
  financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating
  effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as
  we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.


                                                                   106

26/04/23, 09:00                                                            f-20221231




  Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting

  A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
  reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally
  accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures
  that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
  dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to
  permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
  expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the
  company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or
  disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

  Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,
  projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate
  because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

  Critical Audit Matters

  The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial
  statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or
  disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective,
  or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated
  financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate
  opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.

  Ford Credit Consumer Finance Receivables Allowance for Credit Losses

  As described in Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company had consumer finance receivables of
  $71,414 million, for which a consumer allowance for credit losses of $838 million was recorded as of December 31, 2022.
  The consumer allowance for credit losses represents management’s estimate of the lifetime expected credit losses inherent
  in the consumer finance receivables as of the balance sheet date. For consumer receivables that share similar risk
  characteristics, management estimates the lifetime expected credit losses based on a collective assessment using
  measurement models and management judgment. The lifetime expected credit losses for the receivables is determined by
  applying probability of default and loss given default assumptions to monthly expected exposures, then discounting these
  cash flows to present value using the receivable’s original effective interest rate or the current effective interest rate for a
  variable rate receivable. If management does not believe the models reflect lifetime expected credit losses for the portfolio,
  an adjustment is made to reflect management judgment regarding qualitative factors including economic uncertainty,
  observable changes in portfolio performance, and other relevant factors.

  The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the Ford Credit consumer finance
  receivables allowance for credit losses is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management in
  determining the consumer finance receivables allowance for credit losses; (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity
  and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence relating to the probability of default and loss given default
  assumptions and management’s judgment regarding qualitative factors; and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of
  professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.

  Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall
  opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to
  the Company’s determination of the consumer finance receivables allowance for credit losses. These procedures also
  included, among others (i) testing management’s process for determining the consumer finance receivables allowance for
  credit losses; (ii) evaluating the appropriateness of the models used to determine the allowance; (iii) evaluating the
  reasonableness of the probability of default and loss given default assumptions; (iv) testing the data used in the models; and
  (v) evaluating the reasonableness of management’s judgment regarding qualitative factors related to economic uncertainty,
  observable changes in portfolio performance, and other relevant factors. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge
  were used to assist in performing the procedures described in (i) through (v).

  Warranty and Field Service Actions Accrual (United States)

  As described in Note 25 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company had an accrual for estimated future warranty
  and field service action costs, net of estimated supplier recoveries (“warranty accrual”), of $9,193 million as of December 31,
  2022, of which the United States comprises a significant portion. Management accrues the estimated cost of both base
  warranty coverages and field service actions at the time of sale. Management establishes their estimate of base warranty
  obligations using a patterned estimation model, using historical information regarding the nature, frequency, and average
  cost of claims for each vehicle line by model year. Management establishes their estimates of field service action obligations
  using a patterned estimation model, using historical information regarding the nature, frequency, severity, and average cost
  of claims for each model year. Management reevaluates the adequacy of their accruals on a regular basis.

  The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the warranty accrual for the United
  States is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management in the estimation of the accrual and
  development of the patterned estimation model; (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing
  procedures and evaluating the estimation model and significant assumptions related to the frequency and average cost of
  claims; and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.

  Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall
  opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls related to
  the estimate of the warranty accrual for the United States. These procedures also included, among others, evaluating the
  reasonableness of significant assumptions used by management to develop the warranty accrual for the United States,
  related to the frequency and average cost of claims, in part by considering the historical experience of the Company.
  Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in evaluating the appropriateness of the model as well
  as the reasonableness of significant assumptions related to the frequency and average cost of claims.

  NOTE 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

      For each accounting topic that is addressed in its own note, the description of the accounting policy may be found in the
  related note. Other significant accounting policies are described below.

  Use of Estimates

      The preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect our results. Estimates
  are used to account for certain items such as marketing accruals, warranty costs, employee benefit programs, allowance for
  credit losses, and other items requiring judgment. Estimates are based on assumptions that we believe are reasonable
  under the circumstances. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved with estimates, actual results may differ.

  Foreign Currency

      When an entity has monetary assets and liabilities denominated in a currency that is different from its functional
  currency, we remeasure those assets and liabilities from the transactional currency to the entity’s functional currency. The
  effect of this remeasurement process and the results of our related foreign currency hedging activities are reported in Cost of
  sales and Other income/(loss), net and were $(46) million, $(74) million, and $180 million, for the years ended 2020, 2021,
  and 2022, respectively.

       Generally, our foreign subsidiaries use the local currency as their functional currency. We translate the assets and
  liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries from their respective functional currencies to U.S. dollars using end-of-period exchange
  rates. Changes in the carrying value of these assets and liabilities attributable to fluctuations in exchange rates are
  recognized in Foreign currency translation, a component of Other comprehensive income/(Ioss), net of tax. Upon sale or
  upon complete or substantially complete liquidation of an investment in a foreign subsidiary, the amount of accumulated
  foreign currency translation related to the entity is reclassified to income and recognized as part of the gain or loss on the
  investment.

  Cash Equivalents

       Cash and cash equivalents are highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and are
  subject to an insignificant risk of change in value due to interest rate, quoted price, or penalty on withdrawal. A debt security
  is classified as a cash equivalent if it meets these criteria and if it has a remaining time to maturity of three months or less
  from the date of purchase. Amounts on deposit and available upon demand, or negotiated to provide for daily liquidity without
  penalty, are classified as Cash and cash equivalents. Time deposits, certificates of deposit, and money market accounts that
  meet the above criteria are reported at par value on our consolidated balance sheets.

  Restricted Cash

      Cash and cash equivalents that are restricted as to withdrawal or use under the terms of certain contractual agreements
  are recorded in Other assets in the non-current assets section of our consolidated balance sheets. Our Company excluding
  Ford Credit restricted cash balances primarily include various escrow agreements related to legal, insurance, customs, and
  environmental matters and cash held under the terms of certain contractual agreements. Our Ford Credit segment restricted
  cash balances primarily include cash held to meet certain local governmental and regulatory reserve requirements and cash
  held under the terms of certain contractual agreements. Restricted cash does not include required minimum balances or
  cash securing debt issued through securitization transactions.


                                                                   115

  NOTE 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

  Marketable Securities

      Investments in debt securities with a maturity date greater than three months at the date of purchase and other debt
  securities for which there is more than an insignificant risk of change in value due to interest rate, quoted price, or penalty on
  withdrawal are classified and accounted for as either trading or available-for-sale marketable securities. Equity securities
  with a readily determinable fair value are classified and accounted for as trading marketable securities.

      Realized gains and losses, interest income, and dividend income on all of our marketable securities and unrealized
  gains and losses on securities not classified as available for sale are recorded in Other income/(loss), net. Unrealized gains
  and losses on available-for-sale securities are recognized in Unrealized gains and losses on securities, a component of
  Other comprehensive income/(loss), net of tax. Realized gains and losses and reclassifications of accumulated other
  comprehensive income into net income are measured using the specific identification method.

      On a quarterly basis, we review our available-for-sale debt securities for credit losses. We compare the present value of
  cash flows expected to be collected from the security with the amortized cost basis of the security. If the present value of
  cash flows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost basis of the security, we determine if a credit loss
  allowance is necessary. If a credit loss allowance is necessary, we will record an allowance, limited by the amount that fair
  value is less than the amortized cost basis, and recognize the corresponding charge in Other income/(loss), net. Factors we
  consider include the severity of the impairment, the reason for the decline in value, interest rate changes, and counterparty
  long-term ratings.

  Trade, Notes, and Other Receivables

        Trade, notes, and other receivables consist primarily of receivables from contracts with customers for the sale of
  vehicles, parts, and accessories. The current portion of trade and notes receivables is reported in Trade and other
  receivables, net. The non-current portion of notes receivables is reported in Other assets. Trade and notes receivables are
  initially recorded at transaction cost. Trade receivables are typically outstanding for 30 days or less. Each reporting period,
  we evaluate the collectibility of the trade and notes receivables and record an allowance for credit losses representing our
  estimate of the expected losses that result from all possible default events over the expected life of the receivables. Additions
  to the allowance for credit losses are made by recording charges to bad debt expense reported in Selling, administrative,
  and other expenses and Cost of sales. Trade and notes receivables are written off against the allowance for credit losses
  when the account is deemed to be uncollectible.

  Net Intangible Assets and Goodwill

       Indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized but are tested for impairment annually or more
  frequently if events or circumstances indicate the assets may be impaired. Goodwill impairment testing is also performed
  following an allocation of goodwill to a business to be disposed or a change in reporting units. We test for impairment by
  assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible
  asset or the reporting unit allocated the goodwill is less than its carrying amount. If the qualitative assessment indicates a
  possible impairment, the carrying value of the asset or reporting unit is compared with its fair value. Fair value is measured
  relying primarily on the income approach by applying a discounted cash flow method, the market approach using market
  values or multiples, and/or third-party valuations. We capitalize and amortize our finite-lived intangible assets over their
  estimated useful lives.

      The carrying amount of intangible assets and goodwill is reported in Other assets in the non-current assets section of
  our consolidated balance sheets. Intangible assets are comprised primarily of advertising agreements, land rights, and
  technology licenses. The net carrying amount of our intangible assets was $111 million and $86 million at
  December 31, 2021 and 2022, respectively. For the periods presented, we have not recorded any material impairments for
  indefinite-lived intangibles. The net carrying amount of goodwill was $619 million and $603 million at December 31, 2021 and
  2022, respectively. In 2021, we fully impaired goodwill for two investments in our Mobility segment. In 2022, we have not
  recorded any impairments for goodwill.

  NOTE 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

  Held-and-Used Long-Lived Asset Impairment

       We test long-lived asset groups when changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.
  Events that trigger a test for recoverability include material adverse changes in projected revenues or expenses, present
  cash flow losses combined with a history of cash flow losses and a forecast that demonstrates significant continuing losses,
  significant negative industry or economic trends, a current expectation that a long-lived asset group will be disposed of
  significantly before the end of its useful life, a significant adverse change in the manner in which an asset group is used or in
  its physical condition, or when there is a change in the asset grouping. In addition, investing in new, emerging products (e.g.,
  EVs) or services (e.g., connectivity) may require substantial upfront investment, which may result in initial forecasted
  negative cash flows in the near term. In these instances, near term negative cash flows on their own may not be indicative of
  a triggering event for evaluation of impairment. In such circumstances, we also conduct a qualitative evaluation of the
  business growth trajectory, which includes updating our assessment of when positive cash flows are expected to be
  generated, confirming whether established milestones are being achieved, and assessing our ability and intent to continue to
  access required funding to execute the plan. If this evaluation indicates a triggering event has occurred, a test for
  recoverability is performed.

       When a triggering event occurs, a test for recoverability is performed, comparing projected undiscounted future cash
  flows to the carrying value of the asset group. If the undiscounted forecasted cash flows are less than the carrying value of
  the assets, the asset group’s fair value is measured relying primarily on a discounted cash flow method. To the extent
  available, we will also consider third-party valuations of our long-lived assets that were prepared for other business
  purposes. An impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying value of the asset group exceeds its
  estimated fair value. When an impairment loss is recognized for assets to be held and used, the adjusted carrying amounts
  of those assets are depreciated over their remaining useful life. For the periods presented, we have not recorded any
  material impairments.

  Held-for-Sale Asset Impairment

      We perform an impairment test on a disposal group to be discontinued, held for sale (“HFS”), or otherwise disposed
  when we have committed to an action and the action is expected to be completed within one year. We estimate fair value to
  approximate the expected proceeds to be received, less cost to sell, and compare it to the carrying value of the disposal
  group. An impairment charge is recognized when the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value (see Note 22). We also
  assess fair value if circumstances arise that were considered unlikely and, as a result, we decide not to sell a disposal group
  previously classified as HFS upon reclassification as held and used. When there is a change to a plan of sale, and the
  assets are reclassified from HFS to held and used, the long-lived assets would be reported at the lower of (i) the carrying
  amount before HFS designation, adjusted for depreciation that would have been recognized if the assets had not been
  classified as HFS, or (ii) the fair value at the date the assets no longer satisfy the criteria for classification as HFS.

  Fair Value Measurements

     We measure fair value of our financial instruments, including those held within our pension plans, using various valuation
  methods and prioritize the use of observable inputs. The use of observable and unobservable inputs and their significance in
  measuring fair value are reflected in our fair value hierarchy:

      •    Level 1 - inputs include quoted prices for identical instruments and are the most observable
      •    Level 2 - inputs include quoted prices for similar instruments and observable inputs such as interest rates, currency
           exchange rates, and yield curves
      •    Level 3 - inputs include data not observable in the market and reflect management judgment about the assumptions
           market participants would use in pricing the instruments

       Fixed income securities, equities, commingled funds, derivative financial instruments, and alternative assets are
  remeasured and presented within our consolidated financial statements at fair value on a recurring basis. Finance
  receivables and debt are measured at fair value for the purpose of disclosure. Other assets and liabilities are measured at
  fair value on a nonrecurring basis.

      Transfers into and transfers out of the hierarchy levels are recognized as if they had taken place at the end of the
  reporting period.

  NOTE 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

  Valuation Method

       Fixed Income Securities. Fixed income securities primarily include government securities, government agency securities,
  corporate bonds, and asset-backed securities. We generally measure fair value using prices obtained from pricing services
  or quotes from dealers that make markets in such securities. Pricing methods and inputs to valuation models used by the
  pricing services depend on the security type (i.e., asset class). Where possible, fair values are generated using market
  inputs, including quoted prices (the closing price in an exchange market), bid prices (the price at which a buyer stands ready
  to purchase), and other market information. For fixed income securities that are not actively traded, the pricing services use
  alternative methods to determine fair value for the securities, including quotes for similar fixed income securities, matrix
  pricing, discounted cash flow using benchmark curves, or other factors. In certain cases, when market data are not available,
  we may use broker quotes or pricing services that use proprietary pricing models to determine fair value. The proprietary
  models incorporate unobservable inputs primarily consisting of prepayment curves, discount rates, default assumptions,
  recovery rates, yield assumptions, and credit spread assumptions.

      An annual review is performed on the security prices received from our pricing services, which includes discussion and
  analysis of the inputs used by the pricing services to value our securities. We also compare the price of certain securities
  sold close to the quarter end to the price of the same security at the balance sheet date to ensure the reported fair value is
  reasonable.

       Equities. Equity securities are primarily exchange-traded and are valued based on the closing bid, official close, or last
  trade pricing on an active exchange. If closing prices are not available, securities are valued at the last quoted bid price or
  may be valued using the last available price. Securities that are thinly traded or delisted are valued using unobservable
  pricing data.

      Commingled Funds. Fixed income and public equity securities may each be combined into commingled fund
  investments. Most commingled funds are valued to reflect our interest in the fund based on the reported year-end net asset
  value (“NAV”).

       Derivative Financial Instruments. Exchange-traded derivatives for which market quotations are readily available are
  valued at the last reported sale price or official closing price as reported by an independent pricing service on the primary
  market or exchange on which they are traded. Over-the-counter derivatives are not exchange traded and are valued using
  independent pricing services or industry-standard valuation models such as a discounted cash flow. When discounted cash
  flow models are used, projected future cash flows are discounted to a present value using market-based expectations for
  interest rates, foreign exchange rates, commodity prices, and the contractual terms of the derivative instruments. The
  discount rate used is the relevant benchmark interest rate (e.g., LIBOR, SOFR, SONIA) plus an adjustment for non-
  performance risk. The adjustment reflects the full credit default swap (“CDS”) spread applied to a net exposure, by
  counterparty, considering the master netting agreements and any posted collateral. We use our counterparty’s CDS spread
  when we are in a net asset position and our own CDS spread when we are in a net liability position. In cases when market
  data are not available, we use broker quotes and models (e.g., Black-Scholes) to determine fair value. This includes
  situations where there is a lack of liquidity for a particular currency or commodity, or when the instrument is longer dated.
  When broker quotes or models are used to determine fair value, the derivative is categorized within Level 3 of the hierarchy.
  All other derivatives are categorized within Level 2.

       Alternative Assets. Hedge funds generally hold liquid and readily-priced securities, such as public equities, exchange-
  traded derivatives, and corporate bonds. Private equity and real estate investments are less liquid. External investment
  managers typically report valuations reflecting initial cost or updated appraisals, which are adjusted for cash flows, and
  realized and unrealized gains/losses. All alternative assets are valued at the NAV provided by the investment sponsor or
  third party administrator, as they do not have readily-available market quotations. Valuations may be lagged up to
  six months. The NAV will be adjusted for cash flows (additional investments or contributions, and distributions) through year
  end. We may make further adjustments for any known substantive valuation changes not reflected in the NAV.

  NOTE 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

       We may hold annuity contracts within some of our non-U.S. pension plans (see Note 17). Generally, the contract
  valuation method is applied for markets where we have purchased non-participating annuity contracts from an insurer as a
  plan asset. The Ford-Werke GmbH (“Ford-Werke”) defined benefit plan is primarily funded through a participating group
  insurance contract. For the Ford-Werke plan, we measure the fair value of the insurance asset by projecting expected future
  cash flows from the contract and discounting them to present value based on current market rates as well as an assessment
  for non-performance risk of the insurance company. The assumptions used to project expected future cash flows are based
  on actuarial estimates and are unobservable. We include all annuity contracts within Level 3 of the hierarchy.

      Finance Receivables. We measure finance receivables at fair value using internal valuation models (see Note 10).
  These models project future cash flows of financing contracts based on scheduled contract payments (including principal
  and interest) and assumptions regarding expected credit losses and pre-payment speed. The projected cash flows are
  discounted to present value at current rates that incorporate present yield curve and credit spread assumptions. The fair
  value of finance receivables is categorized within Level 3 of the hierarchy.

      On a nonrecurring basis, we also measure at fair value retail contracts greater than 120 days past due or deemed to be
  uncollectible, and individual dealer loans probable of foreclosure. We use the fair value of collateral, adjusted for estimated
  costs to sell, to determine the fair value of these receivables. The collateral for a retail financing or wholesale receivable is
  the vehicle financed, and for dealer loans is real estate or other property.

      The fair value of collateral for retail receivables is calculated as the outstanding receivable balances multiplied by the
  average recovery value percentage. The fair value of collateral for wholesale receivables is based on the wholesale market
  value or liquidation value for new and used vehicles. The fair value of collateral for dealer loans is determined by reviewing
  various appraisals, which include total adjusted appraised value of land and improvements, alternate use appraised value,
  broker’s opinion of value, and purchase offers.

      Debt. We measure debt at fair value using quoted prices for our own debt with approximately the same remaining
  maturities (see Note 19). Where quoted prices are not available, we estimate fair value using discounted cash flows and
  market-based expectations for interest rates, credit risk, and the contractual terms of the debt instruments. For certain short-
  term debt with an original maturity date of one year or less, we assume that book value is a reasonable approximation of the
  debt’s fair value. The fair value of debt is categorized within Level 2 of the hierarchy.

  Finance and Lease Incentives

      We routinely sponsor special retail financing and lease incentives to dealers’ customers who choose to finance or lease
  our vehicles from Ford Credit. The cost for these incentives is included in our estimate of variable consideration when the
  vehicle is sold to the dealer. Ford Credit records a reduction to the finance receivable or reduces the cost of the vehicle
  operating lease when it records the underlying finance contract, and we transfer to Ford Credit the amount of the incentive
  on behalf of the dealer’s customer. See Note 1 for additional information regarding transactions between Automotive and
  Ford Credit. The Ford Credit segment recognized interest revenue of $2.4 billion, $2.4 billion, and $2.1 billion in 2020, 2021,
  and 2022, respectively, and lower depreciation of $2.3 billion, $1.9 billion, and $1.2 billion in 2020, 2021, and 2022,
  respectively, associated with these incentives.

  Supplier Price Adjustments

      We frequently negotiate price adjustments with our suppliers throughout a production cycle, even after receiving
  production material. These price adjustments relate to changes in design specification or other commercial terms such as
  economics, productivity, and competitive pricing. We recognize price adjustments when we reach final agreement with our
  suppliers. In general, we avoid direct price changes in consideration of future business; however, when these occur, our
  policy is to defer the recognition of any such price change given explicitly in consideration of future business.

  Government Incentives

      We receive incentives from U.S. and non-U.S. governmental entities in the form of tax rebates or credits, grants, and
  loans. Government incentives are recorded in our consolidated financial statements in accordance with their purpose as a
  reduction of expense or other income. The benefit is generally recorded when all conditions attached to the incentive have
  been met and there is reasonable assurance of receipt. Government incentives related to capital investment are recognized
  in Net Property as a reduction to the net book value of the related asset. The incentives are recognized over the life of the
  asset as a reduction to depreciation and amortization expense.

      During 2022, we were awarded incentives by the State of Tennessee related to land, capital, and property tax
  abatements in connection with Ford’s capital investment in our new electric vehicle assembly plant and job commitments.
  These incentives are available until December 2051. The fair value of the land benefit in 2022 was $144 million and was
  recorded in Net Property fully offset by the value of the incentive. A capital grant of $285 million is expected to be received in
  2023 and will reduce the depreciation and amortization expense over the life of the related assets.

      In 2022, we were also awarded incentives by the Canadian government and Province of Ontario in connection with the
  development of electric vehicles at our Oakville Assembly Plant. Equipment, tooling, and labor incentives of C$590 million
  are expected to be received over the terms of the agreements beginning in 2024 through 2033 and will be recognized as a
  reduction of the related expenses.

       Ford may also indirectly benefit from incentives and grants awarded to companies with which we are affiliated but are not
  included in our consolidated financial statements.

      Ford’s receipt of government incentives could be subject to reduction, termination, or claw back. Claw back provisions
  are monitored for ongoing compliance and are accrued for when losses are deemed probable and estimable (see Note 25).

  Selected Other Costs

       Engineering, research, and development expenses are reported in Cost of sales and primarily consist of salaries,
  materials, and associated costs. Engineering, research, and development costs are expensed as incurred when performed
  internally or when performed by a supplier if we guarantee reimbursement. Advertising costs are reported in Selling,
  administrative, and other expenses and are expensed as incurred. Engineering, research, development, and advertising
  expenses for the years ended December 31 were as follows (in billions):
                                                                                        2020             2021             2022

  NOTE 3. NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

  Adoption of New Accounting Standards

      Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2021-10, Government Assistance: Disclosures by Business Entities about
  Government Assistance. Effective January 1, 2022, we adopted the new standard, which requires entities to provide certain
  disclosures in annual period financial statements for those transactions with governments that are accounted for by applying
  a grant or contribution accounting model via analogy to other applicable accounting standards. Adoption of the new standard
  did not have a material impact to our consolidated financial statement disclosures.

      We also adopted the following ASUs during 2022, none of which had a material impact to our consolidated financial
  statements or financial statement disclosures:

  ASU                                                                                                                            Effective Date

  Accounting Standards Issued But Not Yet Adopted

      ASU 2022-02, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses, Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures. In March
  2022, the FASB issued a new accounting standard that eliminates the troubled debt recognition and measurement guidance.
  The new standard requires that an entity apply the loan refinancing and restructuring guidance in ASC 310 to all loan
  modifications and/or receivable modifications. It also enhances disclosure requirements for certain refinancings and
  restructurings by creditors when a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty and requires disclosure of current-period gross
  charge-offs by year of origination in the vintage disclosure. The new standard is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods
  within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2022. The adoption of the new standard is not expected to have a
  material impact on our consolidated financial statements or financial statement disclosures.

      All other ASUs issued but not yet adopted were assessed and determined to be either not applicable or are not expected
  to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements or financial statement disclosures.

  __________
  (a) Includes extended service contract revenue.


      Revenue is recognized when obligations under the terms of a contract with our customer are satisfied; generally this
  occurs when we transfer control of our vehicles, parts, or accessories, or provide services. Revenue is measured as the
  amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for transferring goods or providing services. For the majority of
  sales, this occurs when products are shipped from our manufacturing facilities. However, we defer a portion of the
  consideration received when there is a separate future or stand-ready performance obligation, such as extended service
  contracts or ongoing vehicle connectivity. Sales, value-added, and other taxes we collect concurrent with revenue-producing
  activities are excluded from revenue. Incidental items that are immaterial in the context of the contract are recognized as
  expense. The expected costs associated with our base warranties and field service actions are recognized as expense when
  the products are sold (see Note 25). We do not have any material significant payment terms as payment is received at or
  shortly after the point of sale.

  NOTE 4. REVENUE (Continued)

  Company Excluding Ford Credit

       Vehicles, Parts, and Accessories. For the majority of vehicles, parts, and accessories, we transfer control and recognize
  a sale when we ship the product from our manufacturing facility to our customer (dealers and distributors). We receive cash
  equal to the invoice price for most vehicle sales at the time of wholesale. When the vehicle sale is financed by our wholly-
  owned subsidiary Ford Credit, the dealer is obligated to pay Ford Credit when it sells the vehicle to the retail customer (see
  Note 10). Payment terms on part sales to dealers, distributors, and retailers range from 30 to 120 days. The amount of
  consideration we receive and revenue we recognize varies with changes in return rights and marketing incentives we offer to
  our customers and their customers. When we give our dealers the right to return eligible parts and accessories, we estimate
  the expected returns based on an analysis of historical experience. Estimates of marketing incentives are based on expected
  retail and fleet sales volumes, mix of products to be sold, and incentive programs to be offered. Customer acceptance of
  products and programs, as well as other market conditions, will impact these estimates. We adjust our estimate of revenue
  at the earlier of when the value of consideration we expect to receive changes or when the consideration becomes fixed. As
  a result of changes in our estimate of marketing incentives, we recorded a decrease in revenue of $973 million during 2020
  and an increase in revenue of $252 million and $209 million during 2021 and 2022, respectively, related to revenue
  recognized in prior annual periods.

      We have elected to recognize the cost for freight and shipping when control over vehicles, parts, or accessories have
  transferred to the customer as an expense in Cost of sales.

      We sell vehicles to daily rental companies and may guarantee that we will pay them the difference between an agreed
  amount and the value they are able to realize upon resale. At the time of transfer of vehicles to the daily rental companies,
  we record the probable amount we will pay under the guarantee to Other liabilities and deferred revenue (see Note 25).

       Used Vehicles. We sell used vehicles both at auction and through our consolidated dealerships. Proceeds from the sale
  of these vehicles are recognized in Company excluding Ford Credit revenues upon transfer of control of the vehicle to the
  customer, and the related vehicle carrying value is recognized in Cost of sales.

      Services and other revenue. For separate or stand-ready performance obligations that are included as part of the vehicle
  consideration received (e.g., free extended service contracts, vehicle connectivity, over-the-air updates), we use an
  observable price to determine the stand-alone selling price or, when one is not available, we use a cost-plus margin
  approach. We also sell separately priced service contracts that extend mechanical and maintenance coverages beyond our
  base warranty agreements to vehicle owners. We receive payment at contract inception and the contracts generally range
  from 12 to 120 months. We recognize revenue for vehicle service contracts that extend mechanical and maintenance
  coverages beyond our base warranties over the term of the agreement in proportion to the costs we expect to incur in
  satisfying the contract obligations. Revenue related to other future or stand-ready performance obligations is generally
  recognized on a straight-line basis over the period in which services are expected to be performed.

      We had a balance of $4.2 billion and $4.3 billion of unearned revenue associated primarily with outstanding extended
  service contracts reported in Other liabilities and deferred revenue at December 31, 2020 and 2021, respectively. We
  recognized $1.3 billion and $1.4 billion of the unearned amounts as revenue during the years ended December 31, 2021 and
  2022, respectively. At December 31, 2022, the unearned amount was $4.4 billion. We expect to recognize approximately
  $1.3 billion of the unearned amount in 2023, $1.1 billion in 2024, and $2 billion thereafter.

      We record a premium deficiency reserve to the extent we estimate the future costs associated with extended service
  contracts exceed the unrecognized revenue. Amounts paid to dealers to obtain these contracts are deferred and recorded as
  Other assets. These costs are amortized to expense consistent with how the related revenue is recognized. We had a
  balance of $309 million and $315 million in deferred costs as of December 31, 2021 and 2022, respectively. We recognized

  NOTE 4. REVENUE (Continued)

       We also receive other revenue related to vehicle-related design and testing services we perform for others, various
  Mobility operations, and net commissions for serving as the agent in facilitating the sale of a third party’s products or services
  to our customers. We have applied the practical expedient to recognize Automotive revenues for vehicle-related design and
  testing services over the two to three year term of these agreements in proportion to the amount we have the right to invoice.

      Leasing Income. We sell vehicles to daily rental companies with an obligation to repurchase the vehicles for a
  guaranteed amount, exercisable at the option of the customer. The transactions are accounted for as operating leases. Upon
  the transfer of vehicles to the daily rental companies, we record proceeds received in Other liabilities and deferred revenue.
  The difference between the proceeds received and the guaranteed repurchase amount is recorded in Company excluding
  Ford Credit revenues over the term of the lease using a straight-line method. The cost of the vehicle is recorded in Net
  investment in operating leases on our consolidated balance sheets and the difference between the cost of the vehicle and
  the estimated auction value is depreciated in Cost of sales over the term of the lease.

  Ford Credit Segment

       Leasing Income. Ford Credit offers leasing plans to retail consumers through Ford and Lincoln brand dealers that
  originate the leases. Ford Credit records an operating lease upon purchase of a vehicle subject to a lease from the dealer.
  The retail consumer makes lease payments representing the difference between Ford Credit’s purchase price of the vehicle
  and the contractual residual value of the vehicle plus lease fees, which we recognize on a straight-line basis over the term of
  the lease agreement. Depreciation and the gain or loss upon disposition of the vehicle is recorded in Ford Credit interest,
  operating, and other expenses.

       Financing Income. Ford Credit originates and purchases finance installment contracts. Financing income represents
  interest earned on the finance receivables (including sales-type and direct financing leases). Interest is recognized using the
  interest method and includes the amortization of certain direct origination costs.

     Insurance Income. Income from insurance contracts is recognized evenly over the term of the agreement. Insurance
  commission revenue is recognized on a net basis at the time of sale of the third party’s product or service to our customer.

  NOTE 6. SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION

       Under our Long-Term Incentive Plans, we may issue restricted stock units (“RSUs”), restricted stock shares (“RSSs”),
  and stock options. RSUs and RSSs consist of time-based and performance-based awards. The number of shares that may
  be granted in any year is limited to 2% of our issued and outstanding Common Stock as of December 31 of the prior
  calendar year. The limit may be increased up to 3% in any year, with a corresponding reduction in shares available for grants
  in future years. Granted RSUs generally cliff vest or ratably vest over a three-year service period. Performance-based RSUs
  have two components: one based on internal financial performance metrics and the other based on total shareholder return
  relative to an industrial and automotive peer group. At the time of vest, RSU awards are net settled (i.e., shares are withheld
  to cover the employee tax obligation). Stock options ratably vest over a three-year service period and expire ten years from
  the grant date.

     The fair value of both the time-based and the internal performance metrics portion of the performance-based RSUs and
  RSSs is determined using the closing price of our Common Stock at grant date. For awards that include a market condition,
  we measure the fair value using a Monte Carlo simulation. The weighted average per unit grant date fair value for the years
  ended December 31, 2020, 2021, and 2022 was $7.11, $13.02, and $15.63, respectively.

       Time-based RSUs generally have a graded vesting feature whereby one-third of each grant vests after the first
  anniversary of the grant date, one-third after the second anniversary, and one-third after the third anniversary. The graded
  vesting method recognizes expense over the service period for each separately-vesting tranche, which results in accelerated
  recognition of expense. The fair value of time-based RSUs, RSSs, and stock options is expensed over the shorter of each
  separate vesting period, using the graded vesting method, or the time period an employee becomes eligible to retain the
  award at retirement. The fair value of performance-based RSUs and RSSs is expensed when it is probable and estimable as
  measured against the performance metrics over the shorter of the performance or required service periods. We measure the
  fair value of our stock options on the date of grant using either the Black-Scholes option-pricing model (for options without a
  market condition) or a Monte Carlo simulation (for options with a market condition). We have elected to recognize forfeitures
  as an adjustment to compensation expense for all RSUs, RSSs, and stock options in the same period as the forfeitures
  occur. Expense is recorded in Selling, administrative, and other expenses.

  Restricted Stock Units and Restricted Stock Shares

       The fair value of vested RSUs and RSSs as well as the compensation cost for the years ended December 31 were as
  follows (in millions):
                                                                                                           2020                   2021                     2022

  (a) Exercised at option prices ranging from $6.96 to $15.37 during 2022.


       We received approximately $22 million in proceeds with an equivalent of about $36 million in new issues used to settle
  the exercised options. For options exercised during the year ended December 31, 2022, the difference between the fair
  value of the Common Stock issued and the respective exercise price was $13 million. Compensation cost for stock options
  for the year ended December 31, 2022 was $0. As of December 31, 2022, there was no unrecognized compensation cost
  related to non-vested stock options. During 2022, no new stock options were granted.

  NOTE 7. INCOME TAXES

      We recognize income tax-related penalties in Provision for/(Benefit from) income taxes on our consolidated income
  statements. We recognize income tax-related interest income and interest expense in Other income/(loss), net on our
  consolidated income statements.

      We account for U.S. tax on global intangible low-taxed income in the period incurred.

  Valuation of Deferred Tax Assets and Liabilities

       Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the future tax consequences attributable to temporary
  differences that exist between the financial statement carrying value of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases,
  and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards on a taxing jurisdiction basis. We measure deferred tax assets and liabilities
  using enacted tax rates that will apply in the years in which we expect the temporary differences to be recovered or paid.

  NOTE 7. INCOME TAXES (Continued)

       Our accounting for deferred tax consequences represents our best estimate of the likely future tax consequences of
  events that have been recognized on our consolidated financial statements or tax returns and their future probability. In
  assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider both positive and negative evidence related to the likelihood of
  realization of the deferred tax assets. If, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that the
  deferred tax assets will not be realized, we record a valuation allowance.

  __________
  (a) Includes a benefit of $2.9 billion to recognize deferred tax assets resulting from changes in our global tax structure in 2021.


       During 2020, based on all available evidence, we established U.S. valuation allowances of $1.3 billion, primarily against
  tax credits as it was deemed more likely than not that these deferred tax assets would not be realized. In assessing the
  realizability of deferred tax assets, we consider the trade-offs between cash preservation and cash outlays to preserve tax
  credits. In 2021, we reversed $918 million of the previously established U.S. valuation allowances. The reversal primarily
  reflected a change in our intent to pursue planning actions involving cash outlays to preserve tax credits. During 2022, we
  reversed an additional $405 million of U.S. valuation allowances, primarily as a result of planning actions.

      At December 31, 2022, $14.8 billion of non-U.S. earnings are considered indefinitely reinvested in operations outside the
  United States, for which deferred taxes have not been provided. Quantification of the deferred tax liability, if any, associated
  with indefinitely reinvested basis differences is not practicable.

      Deferred tax assets for net operating losses and other temporary differences related to certain non-U.S. operations have
  not been recorded as a result of elections to tax these operations simultaneously in U.S. tax returns. During 2021, we
  restructured a significant portion of these operations resulting in recognition of $2.9 billion of net deferred tax assets.
  Reversal of the remaining elections would result in the recognition of $4.3 billion and $4.2 billion of deferred tax assets,
  subject to valuation allowance testing, as of December 31, 2021 and 2022, respectively.

      Operating loss carryforwards for tax purposes were $11.4 billion at December 31, 2022, resulting in a deferred tax asset
  of $4.0 billion. There is no expiration date for $3.1 billion of these losses. A substantial portion of the remaining losses will
  expire beyond 2025. Tax credits available to offset future tax liabilities are $9.4 billion. The majority of these credits have a
  remaining carryforward period of six years or more. Tax benefits of operating loss and tax credit carryforwards are evaluated
  on an ongoing basis, including a review of historical and projected future operating results, the eligible carryforward period,
  and available tax planning strategies. In our evaluation, we anticipate making tax elections that change the order of tax credit
  carryforward utilization on U.S. tax returns.

  NOTE 8. CAPITAL STOCK AND EARNINGS/(LOSS) PER SHARE

       All general voting power is vested in the holders of Common Stock and Class B Stock. Holders of our Common Stock
  have 60% of the general voting power, and holders of our Class B Stock are entitled to such number of votes per share as
  will give them the remaining 40%. Shares of Common Stock and Class B Stock share equally in dividends when and as paid,
  with stock dividends payable in shares of stock of the class held.

      If liquidated, each share of Common Stock is entitled to the first $0.50 available for distribution to holders of Common
  Stock and Class B Stock, each share of Class B Stock is entitled to the next $1.00 so available, each share of Common
  Stock is entitled to the next $0.50 so available, and each share of Common and Class B Stock is entitled to an equal amount
  thereafter.

       We present both basic and diluted earnings/(loss) per share (“EPS”) amounts in our financial reporting. Basic EPS
  excludes dilution and is computed by dividing Net income/(loss) attributable to Ford Motor Company by the weighted-
  average number of shares of Common and Class B Stock outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS reflects the maximum
  potential dilution that could occur from our share-based compensation (“in-the-money” stock options, unvested RSUs, and
  unvested RSSs) and convertible debt. Potentially dilutive shares are excluded from the calculation if they have an anti-
  dilutive effect in the period.

  (a) In 2020 and 2022, there were 29 million and 42 million shares, respectively, excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings/(loss) per share, due to
      their anti-dilutive effect.

     We determine credit losses on AFS debt securities using the specific identification method. During the years ended
  December 31, 2020, 2021, and 2022, we did not recognize any credit loss. The unrealized losses on securities are due to
  changes in interest rates and market liquidity.

  NOTE 10. FORD CREDIT FINANCE RECEIVABLES AND ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES

     Ford Credit manages finance receivables as “consumer” and “non-consumer” portfolios. The receivables are generally
  secured by the vehicles, inventory, or other property being financed.

      Consumer Portfolio. Receivables in this portfolio include products offered to individuals and businesses that finance the
  acquisition of Ford and Lincoln vehicles from dealers for personal or commercial use. Retail financing includes retail
  installment contracts for new and used vehicles and finance leases with retail customers, government entities, daily rental
  companies, and fleet customers.

       Non-Consumer Portfolio. Receivables in this portfolio include products offered to automotive dealers. Dealer financing
  includes wholesale loans to dealers to finance the purchase of vehicle inventory, also known as floorplan financing, as well
  as loans to dealers to finance working capital and improvements to dealership facilities, finance the purchase of dealership
  real estate, and finance other dealer programs. Wholesale financing is approximately 94% of dealer financing.

     Finance receivables are recorded at the time of origination or purchase at fair value and are subsequently reported at
  amortized cost, net of any allowance for credit losses.

      For all finance receivables, Ford Credit defines “past due” as any payment, including principal and interest, that is at
  least 31 days past the contractual due date.

  Finance Receivables Classification

      Finance receivables are accounted for as held for investment (“HFI”) if Ford Credit has the intent and ability to hold the
  receivables for the foreseeable future or until maturity or payoff. The determination of intent and ability to hold for the
  foreseeable future is highly judgmental and requires Ford Credit to make good faith estimates based on all information
  available at the time of origination or purchase. If Ford Credit does not have the intent and ability to hold the receivables,
  then the receivables are classified as HFS.

       Each quarter, Ford Credit makes a determination of whether it is probable that finance receivables originated or
  purchased during the quarter will be held for the foreseeable future based on historical receivables sale experience, internal
  forecasts and budgets, as well as other relevant, reliable information available through the date of evaluation. For purposes
  of this determination, probable means at least 70% likely and, consistent with the budgeting and forecasting period, the
  foreseeable future means twelve months. Ford Credit classifies receivables as HFI or HFS on a receivable-by-receivable
  basis. Specific receivables included in off-balance sheet sale transactions are generally not identified until the month in
  which the sale occurs.

      Held-for-Investment. Finance receivables classified as HFI are recorded at the time of origination or purchase at fair
  value and are subsequently reported at amortized cost, net of any allowance for credit losses. Cash flows from finance
  receivables, excluding wholesale and other receivables, that were originally classified as HFI are recorded as an investing
  activity since GAAP requires the statement of cash flows presentation to be based on the original classification of the
  receivables. Cash flows from wholesale and other receivables are recorded as an operating activity.

      Held-for-Sale. Finance receivables classified as HFS are carried at the lower of cost or fair value. Cash flows resulting
  from the origination or purchase and sale of HFS receivables are recorded as an operating activity in Decrease/(Increase) in
  finance receivables (wholesale and other). Once a decision has been made to sell receivables that were originally classified
  as HFI, the receivables are reclassified as HFS and carried at the lower of cost or fair value. The valuation adjustment, if
  applicable, is recorded in Other income/(loss), net to recognize the receivables at the lower of cost or fair value.

     At December 31, 2021 and 2022, accrued interest was $125 million and $187 million, respectively, which we report in
  Other assets in the current assets section of our consolidated balance sheets.

       Included in the recorded investment in finance receivables at December 31, 2021 and 2022 were consumer receivables
  of $39 billion and $43.9 billion, respectively, and non-consumer receivables of $12 billion and $18.2 billion, respectively,
  (including Automotive receivables sold to Ford Credit, which we report in Trade and other receivables) that have been sold
  for legal purposes in securitization transactions but continue to be reported in our consolidated financial statements. The
  receivables are available only for payment of the debt issued by, and other obligations of, the securitization entities that are
  parties to those securitization transactions; they are not available to pay the other obligations or the claims of Ford Credit’s
  other creditors. Ford Credit holds the right to receive the excess cash flows not needed to pay the debt issued by, and other
  obligations of, the securitization entities that are parties to those securitization transactions (see Note 24).

  Credit Quality

  Consumer Portfolio

      When originating consumer receivables, Ford Credit uses a proprietary scoring system that measures credit quality
  using information in the credit application, proposed contract terms, credit bureau data, and other information. After a
  proprietary risk score is generated, Ford Credit decides whether to originate a contract using a decision process based on a
  judgmental evaluation of the applicant, the credit application, the proposed contract terms, credit bureau information (e.g.,
  FICO score), proprietary risk score, and other information. The evaluation emphasizes the applicant’s ability to pay and
  creditworthiness focusing on payment, affordability, applicant credit history, and stability as key considerations.

      After origination, Ford Credit reviews the credit quality of retail financing based on customer payment activity. As each
  customer develops a payment history, an internally developed behavioral scoring model is used to assist in determining the
  best collection strategies, which allows Ford Credit to focus collection activity on higher-risk accounts. These models are
  used to refine Ford Credit’s risk-based staffing model to ensure collection resources are aligned with portfolio risk. Based on
  data from this scoring model, contracts are categorized by collection risk. Ford Credit’s collection models evaluate several
  factors, including origination characteristics, updated credit bureau data, and payment patterns.

       Credit quality ratings for consumer receivables are based on aging. Consumer receivables credit quality ratings are as
  follows:

      •    Pass – current to 60 days past due;
      •    Special Mention – 61 to 120 days past due and in intensified collection status; and
      •    Substandard – greater than 120 days past due and for which the uncollectible portion of the receivables has already
           been charged off, as measured using the fair value of collateral less costs to sell.


                                                                     136

  Non-Consumer Portfolio

      Ford Credit extends credit to dealers primarily in the form of lines of credit to purchase new Ford and Lincoln vehicles as
  well as used vehicles. Payment is required when the dealer has sold the vehicle. Each non-consumer lending request is
  evaluated by considering the borrower’s financial condition and the underlying collateral securing the loan. Ford Credit uses
  a proprietary model to assign each dealer a risk rating. This model uses historical dealer performance data to identify key
  factors about a dealer that are considered most significant in predicting a dealer’s ability to meet its financial obligations.
  Ford Credit also considers numerous other financial and qualitative factors of the dealer’s operations, including capitalization
  and leverage, liquidity and cash flow, profitability, and credit history with Ford Credit and other creditors.

      Dealers are assigned to one of four groups according to risk ratings as follows:

      •      Group I – strong to superior financial metrics;
      •      Group II – fair to favorable financial metrics;
      •      Group III – marginal to weak financial metrics; and
      •      Group IV – poor financial metrics, including dealers classified as uncollectible.

      Ford Credit generally suspends credit lines and extends no further funding to dealers classified in Group IV.

  NOTE 10. FORD CREDIT FINANCE RECEIVABLES AND ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES (Continued)

      Ford Credit regularly reviews the model to confirm the continued business significance and statistical predictability of the
  model and may make updates to improve the performance of the model. In addition, Ford Credit regularly audits dealer
  inventory and dealer sales records to verify that the dealer is in possession of the financed vehicles and is promptly paying
  each receivable following the sale of the financed vehicle. The frequency of on-site vehicle inventory audits depends
  primarily on the dealer’s risk rating. Under Ford Credit’s policies, on-site vehicle inventory audits of low-risk dealers are
  conducted only as circumstances warrant. On-site vehicle inventory audits of higher-risk dealers are conducted with
  increased frequency based primarily on the dealer’s risk rating, but also considering the results of electronic monitoring of
  the dealer’s performance, including daily payment verifications and monthly analyses of the dealer’s financial statements,
  payoffs, aged inventory, over credit line, and delinquency reports. Ford Credit typically performs a credit review of each
  dealer annually and more frequently reviews certain dealers based on the dealer’s risk rating and total exposure. Ford Credit
  adjusts the dealer’s risk rating, if necessary. The credit quality of dealer financing receivables is evaluated based on Ford
  Credit’s internal dealer risk rating analysis. A dealer has the same risk rating for its entire dealer financing regardless of the
  type of financing.

      Non-Accrual of Revenue. The accrual of financing revenue is discontinued at the time a receivable is determined to be
  uncollectible or when it is 90 days past due. Accounts may be restored to accrual status only when a customer settles all
  past-due deficiency balances and future payments are reasonably assured. For receivables in non-accrual status,
  subsequent financing revenue is recognized only to the extent a payment is received. Payments are generally applied first to
  outstanding interest and fees and then to the unpaid principal balance.

      Troubled Debt Restructuring (“TDR”). A restructuring of debt constitutes a TDR if a concession is granted to a debtor for
  economic or legal reasons related to the debtor’s financial difficulties that Ford Credit otherwise would not consider.
  Consumer and non-consumer receivables that have a modified interest rate below market rate or that were modified in
  reorganization proceedings pursuant to the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, except non-consumer receivables that are current with
  minimal risk of loss, are considered to be TDRs. Ford Credit does not grant concessions on the principal balance of the
  receivables. If a receivable is modified in a reorganization proceeding, all payment requirements of the reorganization plan
  need to be met before remaining balances are forgiven.

  NOTE 10. FORD CREDIT FINANCE RECEIVABLES AND ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES (Continued)

  Allowance for Credit Losses

      The allowance for credit losses represents an estimate of the lifetime expected credit losses inherent in finance
  receivables as of the balance sheet date. The adequacy of the allowance for credit losses is assessed quarterly.

      Adjustments to the allowance for credit losses are made by recording charges to Ford Credit interest, operating, and
  other expenses on our consolidated income statements. The uncollectible portion of a finance receivable is charged to the
  allowance for credit losses at the earlier of when an account is deemed to be uncollectible or when an account is 120 days
  delinquent, taking into consideration the financial condition of the customer or borrower, the value of the collateral, recourse
  to guarantors, and other factors.

       Charge-offs on finance receivables include uncollected amounts related to principal, interest, late fees, and other
  allowable charges. Recoveries on finance receivables previously charged off as uncollectible are credited to the allowance
  for credit losses. In the event Ford Credit repossesses the collateral, the receivable is charged off and the collateral is
  recorded at its estimated fair value less costs to sell and reported in Other assets on our consolidated balance sheets.

  Consumer Portfolio

       For consumer receivables that share similar risk characteristics such as product type, initial credit risk, term, vintage,
  geography, and other relevant factors, Ford Credit estimates the lifetime expected credit loss allowance based on a
  collective assessment using measurement models and management judgment. The lifetime expected credit losses for the
  receivables is determined by applying probability of default and loss given default assumption to monthly expected
  exposures, then discounting these cash flows to present value using the receivable’s original effective interest rate or the
  current effective interest rate for a variable rate receivable. Probability of default models are developed from internal risk
  scoring models taking into account the expected probability of payment and time to default, adjusted for macroeconomic
  outlook and recent performance. The models consider factors such as risk evaluation at the time of origination, historical
  trends in credit losses (which include the impact of TDRs), and the composition and recent performance of the present
  portfolio (including vehicle brand, term, risk evaluation, and new/used vehicles). The loss given default is the percentage of
  the expected balance due at default that is not recoverable, taking into account the expected collateral value and trends in
  recoveries (including key metrics such as delinquencies, repossessions, and bankruptcies). Monthly exposures are equal to
  the receivables’ expected outstanding principal and interest balance.

      The allowance for credit losses incorporates forward-looking macroeconomic conditions for baseline, upturn, and
  downturn scenarios. Three separate credit loss allowances are calculated from these scenarios. They are then probability-
  weighted to determine the quantitative estimate of the credit loss allowance recognized in the financial statements. Ford
  Credit uses forecasts from a third party that revert to a long-term historical average after a reasonable and supportable
  forecasting period, which is specific to the particular macroeconomic variable and which varies by market. Ford Credit
  updates the forward-looking macroeconomic forecasts quarterly.

      If management does not believe the models reflect lifetime expected credit losses for the portfolio, an adjustment is
  made to reflect management judgment regarding qualitative factors, including economic uncertainty, observable changes in
  portfolio performance, and other relevant factors.

     On an ongoing basis, Ford Credit reviews its models, including macroeconomic factors, the selection of macroeconomic
  scenarios, and their weighting, to ensure they reflect the risk of the portfolio.

  Non-Consumer Portfolio

      Dealer financing is evaluated on an individual dealer basis by segmenting dealers by risk characteristics (such as the
  amount of the loans, the nature of the collateral, the financial status of the dealer, and any TDR modifications) to determine if
  an individual dealer requires a specific allowance for credit loss. If required, the allowance is based on the present value of
  the expected future cash flows of the dealer’s receivables discounted at the loans’ original effective interest rate or the fair
  value of the collateral adjusted for estimated costs to sell.

      For the remaining dealer financing, Ford Credit estimates an allowance for credit losses on a collective basis.

       Wholesale Loans. Ford Credit estimates the allowance for credit losses for wholesale loans based on historical loss-to-
  receivable (“LTR”) ratios, expected future cash flows, and the fair value of collateral. For wholesale loans with similar risk
  characteristics, the allowance for credit losses is estimated on a collective basis using the LTR model and management
  judgment. The LTR model is based on the most recent years of history. An LTR ratio is calculated by dividing credit losses
  (i.e., charge-offs net of recoveries) by average net finance receivables, excluding unearned interest supplements and
  allowance for credit losses. The average LTR ratio is multiplied by the end-of-period balances, representing the lifetime
  expected credit loss reserve.

      Dealer Loans. Ford Credit uses a weighted-average remaining maturity method to estimate the lifetime expected credit
  loss reserve for dealer loans. The loss model is based on the industry-wide commercial real estate credit losses, adjusted to
  factor in the historical credit losses for the dealer loans portfolio. The expected credit loss is calculated under different
  macroeconomic scenarios that are weighted to provide the total lifetime expected credit loss.

       After establishing the collective and specific allowance for credit losses, if management believes the allowance does not
  reflect all losses inherent in the portfolio due to changes in recent economic trends and conditions, or other relevant forward-
  looking economic factors, an adjustment is made based on management judgment.

      For the year ended December 31, 2022, the allowance for credit losses decreased $80 million primarily due to Ford
  Credit’s current expectation that COVID-related losses have been largely avoided, offset partially by deterioration in the
  macroeconomic outlook that was reflected in the reserve balance in the fourth quarter of 2022. Although net charge-offs for
  the year ended December 31, 2022 remained low due, in part, to high vehicle auction values, the impact of higher inflation
  and higher interest rates on future credit losses remains uncertain. Ford Credit will continue to monitor economic trends and
  conditions and portfolio performance and will adjust the reserve accordingly.

  NOTE 12. NET INVESTMENT IN OPERATING LEASES

       Net investment in operating leases consists primarily of lease contracts for vehicles with individuals, daily rental
  companies, government entities, and fleet customers. Assets subject to operating leases are depreciated using the straight-
  line method over the term of the lease to reduce the asset to its estimated residual value. Estimated residual values are
  based on assumptions for used vehicle prices at lease termination and the number of vehicles that are expected to be
  returned. Adjustments to depreciation expense reflecting revised estimates of expected residual values at the end of the
  lease terms are recorded prospectively on a straight-line basis.

       The net investment in operating leases at December 31 was as follows (in millions):

  NOTE 13. NET PROPERTY

      Net property is reported at cost, net of accumulated depreciation, which includes impairments. We capitalize new assets
  when we expect to use the asset for more than one year. Routine maintenance and repair costs are expensed when
  incurred.

      Property and equipment are depreciated primarily using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the
  asset. Useful lives range from 3 years to 40 years. The estimated useful lives generally are 14.5 years for machinery and
  equipment, 8 years for software, 30 years for land improvements, and 40 years for buildings. Tooling generally is amortized
  over the expected life of a product program using a straight-line method.

  Argo AI

       In 2017, we began investing in Argo AI, an artificial intelligence company that became a consolidated subsidiary, with a
  commitment to fund $1 billion over five years to develop autonomous vehicle technology. In 2020, we completed a
  transaction with Volkswagen AG (“VW”) that resulted in Ford and VW holding equal interests in Argo AI, which together
  comprised a majority ownership of the entity. As a result of this transaction, which included $500 million of proceeds from the
  sale to VW of a portion of our interest in Argo AI, we deconsolidated Argo AI, remeasured our retained investment in the
  entity at fair value, and, net of our carrying value in Argo AI’s net assets, recognized a $3.5 billion pre-tax gain in Other
  income/(loss), net. Immediately following this transaction, our retained investment consisted of a $2.4 billion equity method
  investment and a $400 million preferred equity security investment, which were reflected on our consolidated balance sheets
  in Equity in net assets of affiliated companies and Other assets, respectively.

       Although Argo AI made progress on developing highly automated driving technology (L4), to achieve commercially viable
  scale, Argo AI’s technology requires significant additional capital investment and time. In the near term, we see more
  potential for partial or conditional automated driving technology (L2/L3) to be transformative for customers and our business.
  Therefore, in the third quarter of 2022, we made the strategic decision to shift our capital spending from L4 technology being
  developed by Argo AI to advanced L2/L3 systems, which we believe will ultimately be essential to achieve profitable
  commercialization of L4 autonomy at scale in the future. Additionally, because of the significant additional capital and time
  required to achieve commercialization of L4, as well as other macroeconomic factors, Argo AI has been unable to attract new
  investors. After performing external outreach in the third quarter of 2022 to assess market interest in acquiring either Argo AI
  or its technology components and conducting internal reviews to evaluate opportunities to leverage Argo AI’s technology,
  Ford determined that Argo AI no longer has value as a going concern. As a result, we reassessed the carrying value of our
  investment in Argo AI starting from September 30, 2022, and in October 2022, Ford and VW initiated the process of exiting
  the joint development of L4 technology through Argo AI. On October 26, 2022, we announced that Argo AI plans to wind
  down operations, which is in progress.

      Our valuation assumed an orderly conclusion of operations at Argo AI, in which the cash required to satisfy the
  remaining obligations would consume all of Argo AI’s remaining capital. In addition, we assessed whether Argo AI’s
  technology components have value in isolation, and we concluded that the cost to integrate into currently anticipated
  technology ecosystems would be prohibitive.

      Accordingly, we recorded a $2.7 billion pre-tax impairment in the second half of 2022. The non-cash charge was
  reported in Equity in net income/(loss) of affiliated companies. The carrying value of our investment in Argo AI is $0 as of
  December 31, 2022; in addition, we have $65 million in Other liabilities and deferred revenue related to our funding
  commitment in 2023 for our share of Argo AI’s expenses incurred in 2022. The carrying value immediately prior to the
  impairment was higher than our net cash investment of approximately $500 million (i.e., our $1 billion investment less
  proceeds we received from VW) due to the non-cash gain recognized when we deconsolidated Argo AI in 2020 as described
  above.

  NOTE 15. OTHER INVESTMENTS

       We have investments in entities not accounted for under the equity method for which fair values are not readily available.
  We record these investments at cost (less impairment, if any), adjusted for observable price changes in orderly transactions
  for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer. We report the carrying value of these investments in Other assets
  in the non-current assets section of our consolidated balance sheets. These investments were $0.9 billion and $0.4 billion at
  December 31, 2021 and 2022, respectively. See Note 14 for additional information about the decrease from
  December 31, 2021. The cumulative net unrealized gain from adjustments related to Other Investments held at
  December 31, 2022 is $136 million.

  NOTE 17. RETIREMENT BENEFITS

       Defined benefit pension and OPEB plan obligations are remeasured at least annually as of December 31 based on the
  present value of projected future benefit payments for all participants for services rendered to date. The measurement of
  projected future benefits is dependent on the provisions of each specific plan, demographics of the group covered by the
  plan, and other key measurement assumptions. For plans that provide benefits dependent on salary assumptions, we
  include a projection of salary growth in our measurements. No assumption is made regarding any potential future changes to
  benefit provisions beyond those to which we are presently committed (e.g., in existing labor contracts).

      Net periodic benefit costs, including service cost, interest cost, and expected return on assets, are determined using
  assumptions regarding the benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets (where applicable) as of the beginning of each
  year. We have elected to use a fair value of plan assets to calculate the expected return on assets in net periodic benefit
  cost. The funded status of the benefit plans, which represents the difference between the benefit obligation and fair value of
  plan assets, is calculated on a plan-by-plan basis. The benefit obligation and related funded status are determined using
  assumptions as of the end of each year. Actuarial gains and losses resulting from plan remeasurement are recognized in net
  periodic benefit cost in the period of the remeasurement. The impact of a retroactive plan amendment is recorded in
  Accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss), and is amortized as a component of net periodic cost, generally over the
  remaining service period of the active employees. The service cost component is included in Cost of sales and Selling,
  administrative and other expenses. Other components of net periodic benefit cost/(income) are included in Other
  income/(loss), net on our consolidated income statements.

      A curtailment results from an event that significantly reduces the expected years of future service or eliminates the
  accrual of defined benefits for the future services of a significant number of employees. A curtailment gain is recorded when
  the employees who are entitled to a benefit terminate their employment, or when a plan suspension or amendment that
  results in a curtailment gain is adopted. A curtailment loss is recorded when it becomes probable a curtailment loss will
  occur. We recognize settlement expense when the costs associated with all settlements during the year exceed the interest
  component of net periodic cost for the affected plan. Expense from curtailments and settlements is recorded in Other
  income/(loss), net.

      Defined Benefit Pension Plans. We have defined benefit pension plans covering hourly and salaried employees in the
  United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Germany, and other locations. The largest portion of our worldwide obligation is
  associated with our U.S. plans. Virtually all of our worldwide defined benefit plans are closed to new participants.

      In general, our defined benefit pension plans are funded (i.e., have restricted assets from which benefits are paid). Our
  unfunded defined benefit pension plans are treated on a “pay as you go” basis with benefit payments from general Company
  cash. These unfunded plans primarily include certain plans in Germany and the U.S. defined benefit plans for senior
  management.

     OPEB. We have defined benefit OPEB plans, primarily certain health care and life insurance benefits, covering hourly
  and salaried employees in the United States, Canada, and other locations. The largest portion of our worldwide obligation is
  associated with our U.S. plans. Our OPEB plans are unfunded and the benefits are paid from general Company cash.

       Defined Contribution and Savings Plans. We also have defined contribution and savings plans for hourly and salaried
  employees in the United States and other locations. Company contributions to these plans, if any, are made from general
  Company cash and are expensed as incurred. The expense for our worldwide defined contribution and savings plans was
  $398 million, $432 million, and $478 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2021, and 2022, respectively. This
  includes the expense for Company-matching contributions to our primary employee savings plan in the United States of
  $146 million, $152 million, and $152 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2021, and 2022, respectively.

      The actuarial (gain)/loss for our pension benefit obligations in 2021 and 2022 was primarily related to changes in
  discount rates.

  Pension Plan Contributions

      Our policy for funded pension plans is to contribute annually, at a minimum, amounts required by applicable laws and
  regulations. We may make contributions beyond those legally required.

      In 2022, we contributed $567 million to our global funded pension plans and made $379 million of benefit payments to
  participants in unfunded plans. During 2023, we expect to contribute between $500 million and $600 million of cash to our
  global funded pension plans. We also expect to make about $400 million of benefit payments to participants in unfunded
  plans. Based on current assumptions and regulations, we do not expect to have a legal requirement to fund our major
  U.S. pension plans in 2023.

  Pension Plan Asset Information

      Investment Objectives and Strategies. Our investment objectives for the U.S. plans are to minimize the volatility of the
  value of our U.S. pension assets relative to U.S. pension obligations and to ensure assets are sufficient to pay plan benefits.
  Our largest non-U.S. plans (e.g., United Kingdom and Canada) have similar investment objectives to the U.S. plans.

       Investment strategies and policies for the U.S. plans and the largest non-U.S. plans reflect a balance of risk-reducing
  and return-seeking considerations. The objective of minimizing the volatility of assets relative to obligations is addressed
  primarily through asset-liability matching, asset diversification, and hedging. The fixed income asset allocation matches the
  bond-like and long-dated nature of the pension obligations. Assets are broadly diversified within asset classes to achieve
  risk-adjusted returns that, in total, lower asset volatility relative to the obligations. Strategies to address the goal of ensuring
  sufficient assets to pay benefits include target allocations to a broad array of asset classes, and strategies within asset
  classes that provide adequate returns, diversification, and liquidity.

  NOTE 17. RETIREMENT BENEFITS (Continued)

      Derivatives are permitted for fixed income investment and public equity managers to use as efficient substitutes for
  traditional securities and to manage exposure to interest rate and foreign exchange risks. Interest rate and foreign currency
  derivative instruments are used for the purpose of hedging changes in the fair value of assets that result from interest rate
  changes and currency fluctuations. Interest rate derivatives are also used to adjust portfolio duration. Derivatives may not be
  used to leverage or to alter the economic exposure to an asset class outside the scope of the mandate an investment
  manager has been given. Alternative investment managers are permitted to employ leverage (including through the use of
  derivatives or other tools) that may alter economic exposure.

      Alternative investments execute diverse strategies that provide exposure to a broad range of hedge fund strategies,
  equity investments in private companies, and investments in private property funds.

      Significant Concentrations of Risk. Significant concentrations of risk in our plan assets relate to interest rates, growth
  assets, and operating risks. In order to minimize asset volatility relative to the obligations, the majority of plan assets are
  allocated to fixed income investments which are exposed to interest rate risk. Rate increases generally will result in a
  decline in the value of fixed income assets, while reducing the present value of the obligations. Conversely, rate decreases
  generally will increase the value of fixed income assets, offsetting the related increase in the obligations.

      In order to ensure assets are sufficient to pay benefits, a portion of plan assets is allocated to growth assets (primarily
  hedge funds, real estate, private equity, and public equity) that are expected over time to earn higher returns with more
  volatility than fixed income investments, which more closely match pension obligations. Within growth assets, risk is
  mitigated by constructing a portfolio that is broadly diversified by asset class, investment strategy, manager, style, and
  process.

      Operating risks include the risks of inadequate diversification and weak controls. To mitigate these risks, investments
  are diversified across and within asset classes in support of investment objectives. Policies and practices to address
  operating risks include ongoing manager oversight (e.g., style adherence, team strength, firm health, and internal risk
  controls), plan and asset class investment guidelines and instructions that are communicated to managers, and periodic
  compliance reviews to ensure adherence.

      At year-end 2022, Ford securities comprised less than 1% of our plan assets.

       Expected Long-Term Rate of Return on Assets. The long-term return assumption at year-end 2022, which will be used
  to determine the 2023 expected return on assets, is 6.25% for the U.S. plans, 3.75% for the U.K. plans, and 5.03% for the
  Canadian plans, and averages 4.13% for all non-U.S. plans. A generally consistent approach is used worldwide to develop
  this assumption. This approach considers primarily inputs from a range of advisors for long-term capital market returns,
  inflation, bond yields, and other variables, adjusted for specific aspects of our investment strategy by plan. Historical returns
  also are considered where appropriate. The assumption is based on consideration of all inputs, with a focus on long-term
  trends to avoid short-term market influences.

  NOTE 18. LEASE COMMITMENTS

      We lease land, dealership facilities, offices, distribution centers, warehouses, and equipment under agreements with
  contractual periods ranging from less than one year to 40 years. Many of our leases contain one or more options to extend.
  In certain dealership lease agreements, we are the tenant and we sublease the site to a dealer. In the event the sublease is
  terminated, we have the option to terminate the head lease. We include options that we are reasonably certain to exercise in
  our evaluation of the lease term after considering all relevant economic and financial factors.

      Leases that are economically similar to the purchase of an asset are classified as finance leases. The leased (“right-of-
  use”) assets in finance lease arrangements are reported in Net property on our consolidated balance sheets. Otherwise, the
  leases are classified as operating leases and reported in Other assets in the non-current assets section of our consolidated
  balance sheets. We have also entered into manufacturing contracts commencing in a future period where Ford’s portion of
  the output is expected to be significant. As a result, there may be embedded leases, and related liabilities, that will be
  reported as part of our financial statements, typically upon commencement of production.

       For the majority of our leases, we do not separate the non-lease components (e.g., maintenance and operating services)
  from the lease components to which they relate. Instead, non-lease components are included in the measurement of the
  lease liabilities. However, we do separate lease and non-lease components for contracts containing a significant service
  component (e.g., energy performance contracts). We calculate the initial lease liability as the present value of fixed
  payments not yet paid and variable payments that are based on a market rate or an index (e.g., CPI), measured at
  commencement. The majority of our leases are discounted using our incremental borrowing rate because the rate implicit in
  the lease is not readily determinable. All other variable payments are expensed as incurred.

  borrowings from banks and other lenders. Debt issuances are placed directly by us or through securities dealers or
  underwriters and are held by institutional and retail investors. In addition, Ford Credit sponsors securitization programs that

  markets.

      Debt is reported on our consolidated balance sheets at par value adjusted for unamortized discount or premium,
  unamortized issuance costs, and adjustments related to designated fair value hedging (see Note 20). Discounts, premiums,
  and costs directly related to the issuance of debt are capitalized and amortized over the life of the debt or to the put date and
  are recorded in interest expense using the effective interest method. Gains and losses on the extinguishment of debt are
  recorded in Other income/(loss), net.

  NOTE 19. DEBT AND COMMITMENTS (Continued)

  Debt Extinguishment

      Pursuant to our November 2021 cash tender offer and December 2021 redemption, we repurchased or redeemed
  $7.6 billion principal amount of our public unsecured debt securities for an aggregate cost of $9.3 billion (including
  transaction costs and accrued and unpaid interest payments for such tendered securities). As a result of these transactions,
  we recorded a pre-tax loss of $1.7 billion (net of unamortized discounts, premiums, and fees) in Other income/(loss), net in
  2021.

      In September 2022, we redeemed approximately $1.1 billion principal amount of our public unsecured debt securities for
  an aggregate cost of approximately $1.2 billion (including redemption costs and accrued and unpaid interest payments for
  such redeemed securities). As a result of this transaction, we recorded a pre-tax loss of $135 million (net of unamortized
  discounts, premiums, and fees) in Other income/(loss), net in 2022.

  Environmental, Social, Governance (“ESG”) Bonds

      In November 2021 and August 2022, we issued $2.5 billion and approximately $1.8 billion aggregate principal amount of
  green bonds, respectively, under our sustainable financing framework. The interest rates of these green bonds are 3.250%
  and 6.1%, respectively. We are allocating the net proceeds from this issuance to the design, development, and
  manufacturing of our electric vehicle portfolio.

  Convertible Debt

       In March 2021, we issued $2.3 billion aggregate principal amount of unsecured 0% Convertible Senior Notes due 2026,
  including $300 million aggregate principal amount of such notes pursuant to the exercise in full of the overallotment option
  granted to the initial purchasers. The notes will not bear regular interest and the principal amount of the notes will not
  accrete. The total net proceeds from the offering, after deducting debt issuance costs, were approximately $2.267 billion.

      Each $1,000 principal amount of the notes will be convertible into 59.3505 shares of our Common Stock, which is
  equivalent to a conversion price of approximately $16.85 per share, subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified
  events. The notes are convertible, at the option of the noteholders, on or after December 15, 2025. Prior to December 15,
  2025, the notes are convertible only under the following circumstances:

      •    During any fiscal quarter commencing after the fiscal quarter ending on September 30, 2021 (and only during such
           fiscal quarter), if the last reported sale price of our Common Stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not
           consecutive) during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately
           preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price of the notes on each applicable
           trading day;
      •    During the five business day period after any five consecutive trading day period in which the trading price per
           $1,000 principal amount of the notes for each day of that five consecutive trading day period was less than 98% of
           the product of the last reported sale price of our Common Stock and the conversion rate of the notes on such trading
           day;
      •    If we call any or all of the notes for redemption; or
      •    Upon the occurrence of specific corporate events such as a change in control or certain beneficial distributions to
           common stockholders (as set forth in the indenture governing the notes).

      Upon conversion, we will pay cash up to the aggregate principal amount of the notes to be converted and cash, shares
  of our Common Stock, or a combination of cash and shares of our Common Stock, at our election for the remainder of our
  obligation in excess, if any, of the aggregate principal amount of the notes being converted.

  NOTE 19. DEBT AND COMMITMENTS (Continued)

      We may not redeem the notes prior to March 20, 2024. On or after March 20, 2024, we may redeem all or any portion of
  the notes for cash equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes being redeemed if the last reported sale price of our
  Common Stock has been at least 130% of the conversion price then in effect for at least 20 trading days (whether or not
  consecutive) during any 30 consecutive trading day period.

        If we undergo a fundamental change (e.g., change of control), subject to certain conditions, holders of the notes may
  require us to repurchase for cash all or any portion of their notes at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount
  of the notes. In addition, if specific corporate events occur prior to the maturity date or if we issue a notice of redemption, we
  will increase the conversion rate by pre-defined amounts for holders who elect to convert their notes in connection with such
  a corporate event. The conditions allowing holders of the notes to convert were not met in 2021 or 2022.

     The notes were issued at par and fees associated with the issuance of these notes are amortized to Interest expense on
  Company debt excluding Ford Credit over the contractual term of the notes. Amortization of issuance costs was $5 million
  and $7 million in 2021 and 2022, respectively. The effective interest rate of the notes is 0.3%.

      The total estimated fair value of the notes as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2022 was approximately
  $3.2 billion and $2.2 billion, respectively. The fair value was determined using commonly employed valuation methodologies
  applying observable market inputs and is classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.

      The notes did not have an impact on our full year 2021 or 2022 diluted EPS.

  DOE ATVM Incentive Program

      In September 2009, we entered into a Loan Arrangement and Reimbursement Agreement with the DOE, under which we
  borrowed through multiple draws $5.9 billion to finance certain costs for fuel-efficient, advanced-technology vehicles. We
  made our final repayment to the DOE in June 2022.

  U.K. Export Finance Program

      In 2020 and 2022, Ford Motor Company Limited (“Ford of Britain”), our operating subsidiary in the United Kingdom,
  entered into, and drew in full, £625 million and £750 million term loan credit facilities, respectively, with a syndicate of banks
  to support Ford of Britain’s general export activities. Accordingly, U.K. Export Finance (“UKEF”) provided £500 million and
  £600 million guarantees of the credit facilities, respectively, under its Export Development Guarantee scheme, which
  supports high value commercial lending to U.K. exporters. We have also guaranteed Ford of Britain’s obligations under the
  credit facilities to the lenders. As of December 31, 2022, the full £1,375 million under the two credit facilities remained
  outstanding. These five-year, non-amortizing loans mature on June 30, 2025 and June 30, 2027.

  Company Excluding Ford Credit Facilities

        Total Company committed credit lines, excluding Ford Credit, at December 31, 2022 were $19.3 billion, consisting of
  $13.5 billion of our corporate credit facility, $2 billion of our supplemental revolving credit facility, $1.75 billion of our 364-day
  revolving credit facility, and $2.1 billion of local credit facilities. At December 31, 2022, the utilized portion of the corporate
  credit facility was $19 million, representing amounts utilized for letters of credit, and the full $1.75 billion of our 364-day
  revolving credit facility was utilized by Ford Credit, in its capacity as a subsidiary borrower under that facility. In addition, $1.7
  billion of committed Company credit lines, excluding Ford Credit, was utilized under local credit facilities for our affiliates as
  of December 31, 2022. As of January 25, 2023, Ford Credit had repaid the full $1.75 billion outstanding under the 364-day
  revolving credit facility.

      Lenders under our corporate credit facility have $3.4 billion of commitments maturing on June 23, 2025 and $10.1 billion
  of commitments maturing on June 23, 2027. Lenders under our supplemental revolving credit facility have $0.1 billion of
  commitments maturing on September 29, 2024 and $1.9 billion of commitments maturing on June 23, 2025. Lenders under
  our 364-day revolving credit facility have $1.75 billion of commitments maturing on June 22, 2023.

       The corporate, supplemental, and 364-day credit agreements include certain sustainability-linked targets, pursuant to
  which the applicable margin and facility fees may be adjusted if Ford achieves, or fails to achieve, the specified targets
  related to global manufacturing facility greenhouse gas emissions, renewable electricity consumption, and Ford Europe CO2
  tailpipe emissions.

      The corporate credit facility is unsecured and free of material adverse change conditions to borrowing, restrictive
  financial covenants (for example, interest or fixed-charge coverage ratio, debt-to-equity ratio, and minimum net worth
  requirements), and credit rating triggers that could limit our ability to obtain funding or trigger early repayment. The corporate
  credit facility contains a liquidity covenant that requires us to maintain a minimum of $4 billion in aggregate of domestic cash,
  cash equivalents, and loaned and marketable securities and/or availability under the corporate credit facility, supplemental
  revolving credit facility, and 364-day revolving credit facility. The terms and conditions of the supplemental and 364-day
  revolving credit facilities are consistent with our corporate credit facility. Ford Credit has been designated as a subsidiary
  borrower under the corporate credit facility and the 364-day revolving credit facility.

      Each of the corporate credit facility, supplemental revolving credit facility, and 364-day revolving credit facility include a
  covenant that requires us to provide guarantees from certain of our subsidiaries in the event that our senior, unsecured, long-
  term debt does not maintain at least two investment grade ratings from Fitch, Moody’s, and S&P. The following subsidiaries
  have provided unsecured guarantees to the lenders under the credit facilities: Ford Component Sales, LLC; Ford European
  Holdings Inc.; Ford Global Technologies, LLC; Ford Holdings LLC (the parent company of Ford Credit); Ford International
  Capital LLC; Ford Mexico Holdings LLC; Ford Motor Service Company; Ford Next LLC; and Ford Trading Company, LLC.

  NOTE 19. DEBT AND COMMITMENTS (Continued)

  Asset-Backed Debt

       At December 31, 2022, the carrying value of our asset-backed debt was $56.4 billion. This secured debt is issued by
  Ford Credit and includes asset-backed securities used to fund operations and maintain liquidity. Assets securing the related
  debt issued as part of all our securitization transactions are included in our consolidated results and are based upon the legal
  transfer of the underlying assets in order to reflect legal ownership and the beneficial ownership of the debt holder. The third-
  party investors in the securitization transactions have legal recourse only to the assets securing the debt and do not have
  such recourse to us, except for the customary representation and warranty provisions or when we are counterparty to certain
  derivative transactions of the special purpose entities (“SPEs”). In addition, the cash flows generated by the assets are
  restricted only to pay such liabilities; Ford Credit retains the right to residual cash flows. See Note 24 for additional
  information.

      Although not contractually required, we regularly support our wholesale securitization programs by repurchasing
  receivables of a dealer from a SPE when the dealer’s performance is at risk, which transfers the corresponding risk of loss
  from the SPE to us. In order to continue to fund the wholesale receivables, we also may contribute additional cash or
  wholesale receivables if the collateral falls below required levels. The balance of cash related to these contributions was
  $1,150 million and $0 at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2022, respectively, and ranged from $25 million to
  $3,700 million during 2021 and from $0 to $2,850 million during 2022.

      SPEs that are exposed to interest rate or currency risk may reduce their risks by entering into derivative transactions. In
  certain instances, we have entered into derivative transactions with the counterparty to protect the counterparty from risks
  absorbed through derivative transactions with the SPEs. Derivative income/(expense) related to the derivative transactions
  that support Ford Credit’s securitization programs were $(234) million, $41 million, and $466 million for the years ended
  December 31, 2020, 2021, and 2022, respectively. See Note 20 for additional information regarding the accounting for
  derivatives.

      Interest expense on securitization debt was $1.2 billion, $0.9 billion, and $1.3 billion in 2020, 2021, and 2022,
  respectively.

      The assets and liabilities related to our asset-backed debt arrangements included in our consolidated financial
  statements at December 31 were as follows (in billions):

  NOTE 20. DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES

      In the normal course of business, our operations are exposed to global market risks, including the effect of changes in
  foreign currency exchange rates, certain commodity prices, and interest rates. To manage these risks, we enter into highly
  effective derivative contracts:

      •    Foreign currency exchange contracts, including forwards, that are used to manage foreign exchange exposure;
      •    Commodity contracts, including forwards, that are used to manage commodity price risk;
      •    Interest rate contracts, including swaps, that are used to manage the effects of interest rate fluctuations; and
      •    Cross-currency interest rate swap contracts that are used to manage foreign currency and interest rate exposures
           on foreign-denominated debt.

     Our derivatives are over-the-counter customized derivative transactions and are not exchange-traded. We review our
  hedging program, derivative positions, and overall risk management strategy on a regular basis.

       Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedge Accounting. Derivative assets are reported in Other assets and derivative
  liabilities are reported in Payables and Other liabilities and deferred revenue.

      We have elected to apply hedge accounting to certain derivatives. Derivatives that are designated in hedging
  relationships are evaluated for effectiveness using regression analysis at the time they are designated and throughout the
  hedge period. Some derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting; for others, we elect not to apply hedge accounting.

     Cash Flow Hedges. We have designated certain forward contracts as cash flow hedges of forecasted transactions with
  exposure to foreign currency exchange and commodity price risks.

      Changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges are deferred in Accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) and are
  recognized in Cost of sales when the hedged item affects earnings. Our policy is to de-designate foreign currency exchange
  cash flow hedges prior to the time forecasted transactions are recognized as assets or liabilities on our consolidated balance
  sheets and report subsequent changes in fair value through Cost of sales. If it becomes probable that the originally
  forecasted transaction will not occur, the related amount included in Accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) is
  reclassified and recognized in earnings. The cash flows associated with hedges designated until maturity are reported in Net
  cash provided by/(used in) operating activities on our consolidated statement of cash flows. Our cash flow hedges mature
  within three years.

       Fair Value Hedges. Our Ford Credit segment uses derivatives to reduce the risk of changes in the fair value of debt. We
  have designated certain receive-fixed, pay-float interest rate and cross-currency interest rate swaps as fair value hedges of
  fixed-rate debt. The risk being hedged is the risk of changes in the fair value of the hedged debt attributable to changes in
  the benchmark interest rate and foreign exchange. We report the change in fair value of the hedged debt related to the
  change in benchmark interest rate in Ford Credit debt and Ford Credit interest, operating, and other expenses. We report the
  change in fair value of the hedged debt and hedging instrument related to foreign currency in Other income/(loss), net. Net
  interest settlements and accruals and fair value changes on hedging instruments due to the benchmark interest rate change
  are reported in Ford Credit interest, operating, and other expenses. The cash flows associated with fair value hedges are
  reported in Net cash provided by/(used in) operating activities on our consolidated statements of cash flows.

       When a fair value hedge is de-designated, or when the derivative is terminated before maturity, the fair value adjustment
  to the hedged debt continues to be reported as part of the carrying value of the debt and is recognized in Ford Credit
  interest, operating, and other expenses over its remaining life.

       Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments. For total Company excluding Ford Credit, we report changes in the
  fair value of derivatives not designated as hedging instruments through Cost of sales. Cash flows associated with non-
  designated or de-designated derivatives are reported in Net cash provided by/(used in) investing activities on our
  consolidated statements of cash flows.

      Our Ford Credit segment reports the gains/(losses) on derivatives not designated as hedging instruments in Other
  income/(loss), net. Cash flows associated with non-designated or de-designated derivatives are reported in Net cash
  provided by/(used in) investing activities on our consolidated statements of cash flows.

  NOTE 20. DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES (Continued)

  Balance Sheet Effect of Derivative Financial Instruments

      Derivative assets and liabilities are reported on our consolidated balance sheets at fair value and are presented on a
  gross basis. The notional amounts of the derivative instruments do not necessarily represent amounts exchanged by the
  parties and are not a direct measure of our financial exposure. We also enter into master agreements with counterparties
  that may allow for netting of exposures in the event of default or breach of the counterparty agreement. Collateral represents
  cash received or paid under reciprocal arrangements that we have entered into with our derivative counterparties, which we
  do not use to offset our derivative assets and liabilities.

      The fair value of our derivative instruments and the associated notional amounts at December 31 were as follows

  NOTE 21. EMPLOYEE SEPARATION ACTIONS AND EXIT AND DISPOSAL ACTIVITIES

      We record costs associated with voluntary separations at the time of employee acceptance, unless the acceptance
  requires explicit approval by the Company. We record costs associated with involuntary separation programs when
  management has approved the plan for separation, the affected employees are identified, and it is unlikely that actions
  required to complete the separation plan will change significantly. Costs associated with benefits that are contingent on the
  employee continuing to provide service are accrued over the required service period.

  Company Excluding Ford Credit

      Employee separation actions and exit and disposal activities include employee separation costs, facility and other asset-
  related charges (e.g., impairment, accelerated depreciation), dealer and supplier payments, other statutory and contractual
  obligations, and other expenses, which are recorded in Cost of sales and Selling, administrative, and other expenses. Below
  are actions we have initiated, primarily related to the global redesign of our business:

      •    Ford Motor Company Brasil Ltda exited manufacturing operations in Brazil, which resulted in the sale of the São
           Bernardo do Campo plant facilities and machinery and equipment during 2020 as well as closure of facilities in
           Camaçari, Taubaté, and Troller in 2021
      •    Ford Motor Company Limited ceased production at the Bridgend plant in the United Kingdom and the facility was
           closed in September 2020
      •    Ford India Private Limited (“Ford India”) ceased vehicle manufacturing in Sanand in fourth quarter 2021 and ceased
           manufacturing in Chennai in third quarter 2022. In the third quarter of 2022, Ford India entered into an agreement to
           sell the Sanand vehicle assembly and powertrain plants. See Note 22
      •    Ford Espana S.L. ceased production of the Mondeo at the Valencia plant in Spain in March 2022

     In addition, we are continuing to reduce our global workforce and take other restructuring actions, including the
  separation of salaried workers in North America and India in third quarter 2022.

     The following table summarizes the activities for the years ended December 31, which are recorded in Other liabilities
  and deferred revenue (in millions):
                                                                                                       2021              2022

  __________
  (a) Excludes pension costs of $156 million and $57 million in 2021 and 2022, respectively.


      In 2020, we recorded $1.4 billion of non-cash charges related to the write-off of certain tax and other assets in South
  America, accelerated depreciation, and other items. In addition, we recognized a pre-tax net gain on sale of assets of
  $39 million. In 2021, we recorded $739 million for accelerated depreciation and other non-cash items. In 2022, we recorded
  $32 million for accelerated depreciation, impairment of our India held-for-sale assets, and other non-cash items, partially
  offset by tax credits and other benefits. In addition, we recognized a $38 million pre-tax net gain on sale of assets in 2022.

      We recorded $2 billion and $608 million in 2021 and 2022, respectively, related to the actions above. Total charges in
  2023 related to such actions, primarily attributable to employee separations and dealer and supplier settlements, are not
  expected to be significant. We continue to review our global businesses and may take additional restructuring actions where
  a path to sustained profitability is not feasible when considering the capital allocation required for those businesses.

  NOTE 21. EMPLOYEE SEPARATION ACTIONS AND EXIT AND DISPOSAL ACTIVITIES (Continued)

  United Automobile, Aerospace, and Agricultural Implement Workers of America (“UAW”) Voluntary Separation
  Packages

      As agreed in the collective bargaining agreement ratified in November 2019, during the first quarter of 2020, we offered
  voluntary separation packages to our UAW hourly workforce who were eligible for normal or early retirement and recorded
  associated costs of $201 million in Cost of sales. All separations occurred during 2020. In addition, we also offered voluntary
  separation packages in 2022 to certain of our UAW hourly workforce who were eligible for normal or early retirement and
  recorded associated costs of $19 million in Cost of sales.

  Ford Credit

      Accumulated foreign currency translation losses included in Accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) at
  December 31, 2022 of $223 million are associated with Ford Credit’s investments in Brazil and Argentina that have ceased
  operations. We expect to reclassify these losses to income upon substantially complete liquidation of Ford Credit’s
  investments, which may occur over multiple reporting periods. In 2022, we reclassified losses of $155 million to Other
  income/(loss), net upon the liquidation of three investments in Brazil. Although the timing for the completion of the remaining
  actions is uncertain, we expect the majority of losses to be recognized in 2024 or later.

  Romanian manufacturing subsidiary, to Ford Otosan, a joint venture in which Ford has a 41% ownership share. The
  transaction resulted in deconsolidation of our Ford Romania subsidiary in the third quarter of 2022. The fair value of
  consideration received, consisting of cash and a note receivable, approximated the carrying value of Ford Romania at the
  time of sale. The Ford Romania plant in Craiova, Romania will continue to manufacture Ford-branded vehicles for Ford and
  Ford Otosan. Ford’s portion of the output is expected to be significant; as a result, at the time of sale there were about
  $100 million of assets, such as embedded leases, and related liabilities that continue to be reported as part of our financial
  statements.

      Sanand, India (“Sanand”) Plants. In the third quarter of 2022, we entered into an agreement to sell our Sanand vehicle
  assembly and powertrain plants to Tata Passenger Electric Mobility Limited (“Tata”), a subsidiary of Tata Motors Limited. The
  sale transaction includes the land, buildings, and other fixed assets (excluding the powertrain machinery and equipment) for
  the plants. Accordingly, we have reported $88 million of fixed assets for this operation as held for sale for the period ended
  December 31, 2022. We recognized, in Cost of sales, pre-tax impairment charges of $32 million in the third quarter of 2022
  to adjust the carrying value of the held-for-sale assets to fair value less costs to sell. We determined fair value using the
  market approach, estimated based on the negotiated value of the assets. After the sale to Tata, Ford will continue to operate
  the powertrain facility by leasing back the associated land and building.

      On January 10, 2023, we completed the sale of the plants to Tata, which will result in derecognition of the fixed assets
  and recognition of the powertrain facility operating lease right-of-use asset and related lease liability in the first quarter of
  2023. The fair value of the cash consideration received approximated the carrying value of the fixed assets at the time of
  sale.

      Skinny Labs Inc., dba Spin (“Spin”). On April 1, 2022, we completed the sale of Spin, our wholly-owned micro-mobility
  provider, to TIER Mobility SE, a German-based micro-mobility provider, which resulted in the deconsolidation of our Spin
  subsidiary in the second quarter of 2022. In exchange for our shares of Spin, we received preferred equity in TIER Mobility
  SE, which is reflected in our consolidated balance sheets in Other assets as of the second quarter of 2022. The fair value of
  the preferred equity approximated the carrying value of Spin at the time of the transaction.

      Electriphi, Inc. (“Electriphi”). On June 18, 2021, we acquired Electriphi, a California-based provider of charging
  management and fleet monitoring software for electric vehicles. Assets acquired primarily include goodwill, reported in Other
  assets, and software, reported in Net property. The acquisition did not have a material impact on our
  financial statements.

  NOTE 22. ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES (Continued)

       Ford Lio Ho Motor Co., Ltd. (“FLH”). On April 1, 2021, we completed the sale of our controlling financial interest in FLH
  and its wholly owned subsidiary FLH Marketing & Service Limited, which resulted in deconsolidation of our Ford Taiwan
  subsidiary in the second quarter of 2021. FLH will continue to import, manufacture, and sell Ford-branded vehicles through
  at least 2025. We recognized a pre-tax gain of $161 million, which was reported in Other income/(loss), net in the second
  quarter of 2021.

       Getrag Ford Transmissions GmbH (“GFT”). Prior to March 2021, Ford and Magna International Inc. (“Magna”) equally
  owned and operated the GFT joint venture for the purpose of developing, manufacturing, and selling transmissions. We
  accounted for our investment in GFT as an equity method investment. During the first quarter of 2021 and prior to our
  acquisition, GFT recorded restructuring charges, of which our share was $40 million. These charges are included in Equity in
  net income/(loss) of affiliated companies.

      On March 1, 2021, we acquired Magna’s shares in the restructured GFT. The purchase price, which was subject to post-
  closing revisions, was $275 million. The restructured GFT includes the Halewood, UK and Cologne, Germany transmission
  plants, but excludes the Bordeaux, France transmission plant and China interests acquired by Magna. We concluded with
  Magna that these businesses would be better served under separate ownership. The Sanand, India transmission plant
  continues under joint Ford/Magna ownership. As a result of the transaction, we consolidated the restructured GFT,
  remeasured our prior investment in GFT at its $275 million fair value, and recognized in Other income/(loss), net a pre-tax
  gain of $178 million during 2021 and post-closing revisions resulting in a pre-tax gain of $2 million during the first quarter of
  2022. We estimated the fair value of GFT in negotiations with Magna based on the income approach. The significant
  assumptions used in the valuation included GFT’s cash flows that reflect the approved business plan, discounted at a rate
  typically used for a company like GFT.

     Argo AI, LLC (“Argo AI”). On June 1, 2020, we completed a transaction with VW that resulted in Ford and VW holding
  equal interests in Argo AI, which together comprised a majority ownership of the entity. See Note 14 for more information
  about our retained investment in Argo AI following this transaction.

  Ford Credit Segment

      In the first quarter of 2020, Ford Credit completed the sale of its wholly-owned subsidiary Forso Nordic AB, recognizing a
  pre-tax loss of $4 million, reported in Other income/(loss), net, and cash proceeds of $1.3 billion.

  __________
  (a) We do not recognize deferred taxes for a majority of the foreign currency translation gains and losses because we do not anticipate reversal in the
      foreseeable future. However, we have made elections to tax certain non-U.S. operations simultaneously in U.S. tax returns, and have recorded
      deferred taxes for temporary differences that will reverse, independent of repatriation plans, in U.S. tax returns. Taxes or tax benefits resulting from
      foreign currency translation of the temporary differences are recorded in Other comprehensive income/(loss), net of tax.
  (b) Reclassified to Other income/(loss), net.
  (c) Excludes a loss of $1 million, a gain of $4 million, and a loss of $4 million related to noncontrolling interests in 2020, 2021, and 2022, respectively.
  (d) Reclassified to Cost of sales. During the next twelve months we expect to reclassify existing net losses on cash flow hedges of $160 million. See
      Note 20 for additional information.
  (e) Amortization and recognition of prior service costs/(credits) is included in the computation of net periodic pension cost/(income). See Note 17 for
      additional information.

       A VIE is an entity that either (i) has insufficient equity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial
  support, or (ii) has equity investors who lack the characteristics of a controlling financial interest. We consolidate VIEs of
  which we are the primary beneficiary. We consider ourselves the primary beneficiary of a VIE when we have both the power
  to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses or
  the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the VIE. Assets recognized as a result of
  consolidating these VIEs do not represent additional assets that could be used to satisfy claims against our general assets.
  Liabilities recognized as a result of consolidating these VIEs do not represent additional claims on our general assets; rather,
  they represent claims against the specific assets of the consolidated VIEs.

      We have the power to direct the significant activities of an entity when our management has the ability to make key
  operating decisions, such as decisions regarding budgets, capital investment, manufacturing, or product development. For
  securitization entities, we have the power to direct significant activities when we have the ability to exercise discretion in the
  servicing of financial assets, issue additional debt, exercise a unilateral call option, add assets to revolving structures, or
  control investment decisions.

  VIEs of Which We are Not the Primary Beneficiary

      Certain of our affiliates are VIEs in which we are not the primary beneficiary. Our maximum exposure to any potential
  losses associated with these unconsolidated affiliates is limited to our equity investments, accounts receivable, loans, and
  guarantees and was $2.8 billion and $1.0 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2022, respectively, of which $113 million of
  guarantees related to certain obligations of our VIEs in 2022 are also included in Note 25. The decrease in maximum
  exposure from December 31, 2021 is primarily explained by Argo AI (see Note 14), partially offset by the investment in
  BlueOval SK (as described below).

      On July 13, 2022, Ford, SK On Co., Ltd., and SK Battery America, Inc. (a wholly owned subsidiary of SK On) completed
  the creation of BlueOval SK, LLC, a 50/50 joint venture that will build and operate electric vehicle battery plants in Tennessee
  and Kentucky to supply batteries to Ford and Ford affiliates. BlueOval SK is a variable interest entity of which we are not the
  primary beneficiary, and we use the equity method of accounting for our investment. As of December 31, 2022, Ford has
  contributed to BlueOval SK $691 million of its agreed capital contribution of up to $6.6 billion through 2026, subject to any
  adjustments agreed to by the parties.

  VIEs of Which We are the Primary Beneficiary

      Securitization Entities. Through Ford Credit, we securitize, transfer, and service financial assets associated with
  consumer finance receivables, operating leases, and wholesale loans. Our securitization transactions typically involve the
  legal transfer of financial assets to bankruptcy remote SPEs. We generally retain a portion of the economic interests in the
  asset-backed securitization transactions, which could be retained in the form of a portion of the senior interests, the
  subordinated interests, cash reserve accounts, residual interests, and servicing rights. The transfers of assets in our
  securitization transactions do not qualify for accounting sale treatment. In most cases, the bankruptcy remote SPEs meet the
  definition of VIEs for which we are the primary beneficiary and, therefore, are consolidated. We account for all securitization
  transactions as if they were secured financing and therefore the assets, liabilities, and related activity of these transactions
  are consolidated in our financial statements. See Note 19 for additional information on the accounting for asset-backed debt
  and the assets securing this debt.

  NOTE 25. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

     Commitments and contingencies primarily consist of guarantees and indemnifications, litigation and claims, and warranty
  and field service actions.

  Guarantees and Indemnifications

      Financial Guarantees. Financial guarantees and indemnifications are recorded at fair value at their inception.
  Subsequent to initial recognition, the guarantee liability is adjusted at each reporting period to reflect the current estimate of
  expected payments resulting from possible default events over the remaining life of the guarantee. The maximum potential
  payments for financial guarantees were $357 million and $518 million at December 31, 2021 and 2022, respectively. The
  carrying value of recorded liabilities related to financial guarantees was $36 million and $31 million at December 31, 2021
  and 2022, respectively.

      Our financial guarantees consist of debt and lease obligations of certain joint ventures, as well as certain financial
  obligations of outside third parties, including suppliers, to support our business and economic growth. Expiration dates vary
  through 2037, and guarantees will terminate on payment and/or cancellation of the underlying obligation. A payment by us
  would be triggered by failure of the joint venture or other third party to fulfill its obligation covered by the guarantee. In some
  circumstances, we are entitled to recover from a third party amounts paid by us under the guarantee.

      Non-Financial Guarantees. Non-financial guarantees and indemnifications are recorded at fair value at their inception.
  We regularly review our performance risk under these arrangements, and in the event it becomes probable we will be
  required to perform under a guarantee or indemnity, the amount of probable payment is recorded. The maximum potential
  payments for non-financial guarantees were $453 million and $273 million at December 31, 2021 and 2022, respectively.
  The carrying value of recorded liabilities related to non-financial guarantees was $38 million and $0 at December 31, 2021
  and 2022, respectively.

      Included in the $273 million of maximum potential payments at December 31, 2022 are guarantees for the resale value
  of vehicles sold in certain arrangements to daily rental companies. The maximum potential payment of $267 million as of
  December 31, 2022 represents the total proceeds we guarantee the rental company will receive on resale. Reflecting our
  present estimate of proceeds the rental companies will receive on resale from third parties, we do not expect we will have to
  pay under the guarantee.

       In the ordinary course of business, we execute contracts involving indemnifications standard in the industry and
  indemnifications specific to a transaction, such as the sale of a business. These indemnifications might include and are not
  limited to claims relating to any of the following: environmental, tax, and shareholder matters; intellectual property rights;
  power generation contracts; governmental regulations and employment-related matters; dealer, supplier, and other
  commercial contractual relationships; and financial matters, such as securitizations. Performance under these indemnities
  generally would be triggered by a breach of contract claim brought by a counterparty, including a joint venture or alliance
  partner, or a third-party claim. While some of these indemnifications are limited in nature, many of them do not limit potential
  payment. Therefore, we are unable to estimate a maximum amount of future payments that could result from claims made
  under these unlimited indemnities.


                                                                   172

  NOTE 25. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES (Continued)

  Litigation and Claims

      Various legal actions, proceedings, and claims (generally, “matters”) are pending or may be instituted or asserted against
  us. These include, but are not limited to, matters arising out of alleged defects in our products; product warranties;
  governmental regulations relating to safety, emissions, and fuel economy or other matters; government incentives; tax
  matters, including trade and customs; alleged illegal acts resulting in fines or penalties; financial services; employment-
  related matters; dealer, supplier, and other contractual relationships; intellectual property rights; environmental matters;
  shareholder or investor matters; and financial reporting matters. Certain of the pending legal actions are, or purport to be,
  class actions. Some of the matters involve or may involve claims for compensatory, punitive, or antitrust or other treble
  damages in very large amounts, or demands for field service actions, environmental remediation programs, sanctions, loss
  of government incentives, assessments, or other relief, which, if granted, would require very large expenditures.

       The extent of our financial exposure to these matters is difficult to estimate. Many matters do not specify a dollar amount
  for damages, and many others specify only a jurisdictional minimum. To the extent an amount is asserted, our historical
  experience suggests that in most instances the amount asserted is not a reliable indicator of the ultimate outcome.

      We accrue for matters when losses are deemed probable and reasonably estimable. In evaluating matters for accrual
  and disclosure purposes, we take into consideration factors such as our historical experience with matters of a similar
  nature, the specific facts and circumstances asserted, the likelihood that we will prevail, and the severity of any potential
  loss. We reevaluate and update our accruals as matters progress over time.

      For the majority of matters, which generally arise out of alleged defects in our products, we establish an accrual based
  on our extensive historical experience with similar matters. We do not believe there is a reasonably possible outcome
  materially in excess of our accrual for these matters.

      For the remaining matters, where our historical experience with similar matters is of more limited value (i.e., “non-pattern
  matters”), we evaluate the matters primarily based on the individual facts and circumstances. For non-pattern matters, we
  evaluate whether there is a reasonable possibility of a material loss in excess of any accrual that can be estimated. Our
  estimate of reasonably possible loss in excess of our accruals for all material matters currently reflects indirect tax, customs,
  and regulatory matters, for which we estimate the aggregate risk to be a range of up to about $2 billion.

      As noted, the litigation process is subject to many uncertainties, and the outcome of individual matters is not predictable
  with assurance. Our assessments are based on our knowledge and experience, but the ultimate outcome of any matter
  could require payment substantially in excess of the amount that we have accrued and/or disclosed.


                                                                   173

  Warranty and Field Service Actions

      We accrue the estimated cost of both base warranty coverages and field service actions at the time of sale. We establish
  our estimate of base warranty obligations using a patterned estimation model, using historical information regarding the
  nature, frequency, and average cost of claims for each vehicle line by model year. We establish our estimates of field service
  action obligations using a patterned estimation model, using historical information regarding the nature, frequency, severity,
  and average cost of claims for each model year. In addition, from time to time, we issue extended warranties at our expense,
  the estimated cost of which is accrued at the time of issuance. Warranty and field service action obligations are reported in
  Other liabilities and deferred revenue. We reevaluate the adequacy of our accruals on a regular basis.

      We recognize the benefit from a recovery of the costs associated with our warranty and field service actions when
  specifics of the recovery have been agreed with our supplier and the amount of recovery is virtually certain. Recoveries are
  reported in Trade and other receivables, net and Other assets.

     The estimate of our future warranty and field service action costs, net of estimated supplier recoveries, for the years
  ended December 31 was as follows (in millions):
                                                                                                      2021               2022

  NOTE 26. SEGMENT INFORMATION

       We report segment information consistent with the way our chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) evaluates the
  operating results and performance of the Company. Accordingly, we analyze the results of our business through the
  following segments: Automotive, Mobility, and Ford Credit. Items not included within our segments are reported and
  reviewed as part of Corporate Other, Interest on Debt, and Special Items.

       On January 1, 2023, we implemented a new operating model and reporting structure. With this change, we will analyze
  the results of our business through the following reportable segments: Ford Blue, Ford Model e, and Ford Pro (combined,
  replacing the Automotive segment); Ford Next (previously Mobility); and Ford Credit. As a result of the change, beginning
  with our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ending March 31, 2023, we will report our results in these five
  reportable segments. Company adjusted earnings before interest and taxes (“EBIT”) will include the financial results of these
  five reportable segments and Corporate Other, and net income will comprise the financial results of the five reportable
  segments and Corporate Other, as well as Interest on Debt, Special Items, and Taxes.

      Below is a description of our reportable segments and other activities as of December 31, 2022.

  Automotive Segment

       The Automotive segment primarily includes the sale of Ford and Lincoln vehicles, service parts, and accessories
  worldwide, together with the associated costs to develop, manufacture, distribute, and service the vehicles, parts, and
  accessories. This segment includes revenues and costs related to our electrification vehicle programs and enterprise
  connectivity. The segment includes the following regional business units: North America, South America, Europe, China
  (including Taiwan), and the International Markets Group.

  Mobility Segment

      The Mobility segment primarily includes development costs for Ford’s autonomous vehicles and related businesses,
  Ford’s equity ownership in Argo AI (a developer of autonomous driving systems), and other mobility businesses and
  investments. For additional information about our investment in Argo AI, see Note 14.

  Ford Credit Segment

      The Ford Credit segment is comprised of the Ford Credit business on a consolidated basis, which is primarily vehicle-
  related financing and leasing activities.

  Corporate Other

       Corporate Other primarily includes corporate governance expenses, interest income (excluding interest earned on our
  extended service contract portfolio that is included in our Automotive segment) and gains and losses from our cash, cash
  equivalents, and marketable securities (excluding gains and losses on investments in equity securities), and foreign
  exchange derivatives gains and losses associated with intercompany lending. Corporate governance expenses are primarily
  administrative, delivering benefit on behalf of the global enterprise, that are not allocated to operating segments. These
  include expenses related to setting and directing global policy, providing oversight and stewardship, and promoting the
  Company’s interests. Corporate Other assets include: cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities; tax related assets;
  other investments; and other assets managed centrally.

  Interest on Debt

      Interest on Debt is presented as a separate reconciling item and consists of interest expense on Company debt
  excluding Ford Credit. The underlying liability is reported in the Automotive segment and in Corporate Other.




                                                                   175

  NOTE 26. SEGMENT INFORMATION (Continued)

  Special Items

       Special Items are presented as a separate reconciling item. They consist of (i) pension and OPEB remeasurement gains
  and losses, (ii) gains and losses on investments in equity securities, (iii) significant personnel expenses, dealer-related costs,
  and facility-related charges stemming from our efforts to match production capacity and cost structure to market demand and
  changing model mix, and (iv) other items that we do not necessarily consider to be indicative of earnings from ongoing
  operating activities. Our management ordinarily excludes these items from its review of the results of the operating segments
  for purposes of measuring segment profitability and allocating resources. We also report these special items separately to
  help investors track amounts related to these activities and to allow investors analyzing our results to identify certain
  infrequent significant items that they may wish to exclude when considering the trend of ongoing operating results.

                                                             GLOSSARY

  The following terms are frequently used in the text of this report and have the meanings indicated below.

  “Used Core” — An automobile part which has previously been used in the operation of a vehicle. Generally, the Used Core is an
  original equipment (“OE”) automobile part installed by the vehicle manufacturer and subsequently removed for replacement. Used
  Cores contain salvageable parts, which are an important raw material in the remanufacturing process. We obtain most Used Cores
  by providing credits to our customers for Used Cores returned to us under our core exchange programs. Our customers receive
  these Used Cores from consumers who deliver a Used Core to obtain credit from our customers upon the purchase of a newly
  remanufactured automobile part. When sufficient Used Cores are not available from our customers, we purchase Used Cores from
  core brokers, who are in the business of buying and selling Used Cores. The Used Cores purchased from core brokers or returned
  to us by our customers under the core exchange programs, and which have been physically received by us, are part of our raw
  material and work-in-process inventory. Used Cores returned by consumers to our customers but not yet returned to us are
  classified as contract assets until we physically receive these Used Cores.

  “Remanufactured Core” — The Used Core underlying an automobile part that has gone through the remanufacturing process and
  through that process has become part of a newly remanufactured automobile part. The remanufacturing process takes a Used Core,
  breaks it down into its component parts, replaces those components that cannot be reused and reassembles the salvageable
  components of the Used Core and additional new components into a remanufactured automobile part. Remanufactured Cores held
  for sale at our customer locations are included in long-term contract assets. The Remanufactured Core portion of stock adjustment
  returns are classified as contract assets until we physically receive them.

  Item 1.      Business

  General

  We are a leading supplier of automotive aftermarket non-discretionary replacement parts and test solutions and diagnostic
  equipment.

  Consistent with our strategic vision statement to be “The Global Leader for Parts and Solutions that Move Our World Today and
  Tomorrow”, we have implemented a multi-pronged platform for growth in hard parts and test solutions and diagnostic equipment,
  which are discussed further in the sections below. We operate in the $130 billion market for non-discretionary automotive
  aftermarket replacement hard parts business in North America. Our current products in the hard parts business include a significant
  presence in the rotating electrical category (alternators and starters). In January 2019, we expanded our presence into the non-
  discretionary automotive aftermarket replacement parts for heavy-duty truck, industrial, marine and agricultural applications
  category with the acquisition of Dixie Electric, Ltd (“Dixie”), a privately held manufacturer and remanufacturer of alternators and
  starters, based in Ontario, Canada. This acquisition added an estimated $698 million market opportunity for heavy-duty rotating
  electrical to our existing rotating electrical business.

  We have a scalable infrastructure, and our growth opportunities remain abundant. Our growth strategy relating to hard parts
  includes growing market share in all of our existing hard parts product lines with a significant focus on our expanding line of brake
  products.

  Our premium non-discretionary automotive aftermarket replacement parts for light-duty applications are primarily sold to
  automotive retail chain stores and warehouse distributors throughout North America, and to major automobile manufacturers for
  both their aftermarket programs and warranty replacement programs (“OES”). The current population of light-duty vehicles in the
  U.S. is approximately 280 million, and the average age of these vehicles is approximately 12 years and is expected to continue to
  grow, in particular during recession years. The aged vehicle population provides favorable opportunities for sales of our products.
  Although miles driven can fluctuate for various reasons, including fuel prices, they have been generally increasing for several
  years prior to 2020. Demand for replacement parts generally increases with the age of vehicles and miles driven.

  The automotive aftermarket is divided into two markets. The first is the do-it-yourself (“DIY”) market, which is generally serviced
  by the large retail chain outlets and on-line resellers. Consumers who purchase parts from the DIY market generally install parts
  into their vehicles themselves. In most cases, this is a less expensive alternative than having the repair performed by a professional
  installer. The second is the professional installer market, commonly known as the do-it-for-me (“DIFM”) market. Traditional
  warehouse distributors, dealer networks, and commercial divisions of retail chains service this market. Generally, the consumer in
  this market is a professional parts installer. Our products are distributed to both the DIY and DIFM markets. The distinction
  between these two markets has become less defined over the years, as retail outlets leverage their distribution strength and store
  locations to attract customers.

  Our non-discretionary automotive aftermarket replacement parts for heavy-duty truck, industrial, marine, and agricultural
  applications, which have some overlap with the automotive aftermarket, are also sold via specialty distribution channels through
  OES, fleet, and auto electric outlets.

  In addition to our hard parts business, our position within the test solutions and diagnostic equipment market is particularly
  promising. We are focused on expanding our test solutions and diagnostic equipment for performance, endurance, and production
  of multiple components in the electric power train – providing simulation, emulation, and production applications for the
  electrification of both automotive and aerospace industries, including electric vehicle charging systems. We have expanded our test
  solutions and diagnostic equipment applications for combustion engine vehicles, including bench top testers for alternators and
  starters, and offer test solutions and diagnostic equipment for the pre- and post-production of electric vehicles, as well as software
  emulation of power systems applications for the electrification of all forms of transportation, including automobiles, trucks and the
  emerging electrification of systems with the aerospace industry including electric vehicle charging systems.


                                                                    5

  unit test systems, test systems for alternators and starters, belt starter generators, bench-top testers, and specialized test services for
  electric vehicle inverters.

  Segment Reporting

  Pursuant to the guidance provided under the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification
  (“ASC”) for segment reporting, we have identified our chief operating decision maker (“CODM”), reviewed the documents used
  by the CODM, and understand how such documents are used by the CODM to make financial and operating decisions. We have
  determined through this review process that our business comprises three separate operating segments. All of the operating
  segments meet all the aggregation criteria, and are aggregated.

  Sales, Marketing and Distribution

  We sell our products to the largest automotive chains, including Advance (inclusive of Carquest, Autopart International, and
  Worldpac), AutoZone, Genuine Parts (NAPA), and O’Reilly with an aggregate of approximately 25,000 retail outlets. In addition,
  our products are sold to OES customers, professional installers, and a diverse group of automotive warehouse distributors. We also
  sell test solutions and diagnostic equipment via direct and indirect sales channels, technical conferences, and trade shows to some
  of the world’s leading automotive companies, and to the aerospace/aviation sector. We also offer testing services at our technical
  center located in Detroit, Michigan. During fiscal 2022, we sold approximately 99% of our products in North America, with
  approximately 1% of our products sold in Asian and European countries.

  We publish printed and electronic catalogs with part numbers and applications for our hard parts products along with a detailed
  technical glossary and informational database. In addition, we publish printed and electronic product and service brochures and
  data sheets for our test solutions and diagnostic equipment and service offerings. We believe that we maintain one of the most
  extensive catalog and product identification systems available to the market.

  We primarily ship our products from our facilities and various third-party warehouse distribution centers in North America,
  including our 410,000 square foot distribution center in Tijuana, Mexico.

  Customers: Customer Concentration. While we continually seek to diversify our customer base, we currently derive, and have
  historically derived, a substantial portion of our sales from a small number of large customers. Sales to our three largest customers
  in the aggregate represented 85%, 87%, and 84%, and sales to our largest customer, AutoZone, represented 38%, 42%, and 38% of
  our net sales during fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Any meaningful reduction in the level of sales to any of these
  customers, deterioration of the financial condition of any of these customers or the loss of any of these customers could have a
  materially adverse impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.


                                                                       7

  Customer Arrangements; Impact on Working Capital. We have various length agreements with our customers. Under these
  agreements, which in most cases have initial terms of at least four years, we are designated as the exclusive or primary supplier for
  specified categories of our products. Because of the very competitive nature of the market and the limited number of customers for
  these products, our customers have sought and obtained price concessions, significant marketing allowances and more favorable
  delivery and payment terms in consideration for our designation as a customer’s exclusive or primary supplier. These incentives
  differ from contract to contract and can include: (i) the purchase of Remanufactured Core inventory on customer shelves, (ii) the
  issuance of a specified amount of credits against receivables in accordance with a schedule set forth in the relevant contract, (iii)
  support for a particular customer’s research or marketing efforts provided on a scheduled basis, (iv) discounts granted in
  connection with each individual shipment of product, and (v) store expansion or product development support. These contracts
  typically require that we meet ongoing performance standards.

  While these longer-term agreements strengthen our customer relationships, the increased demand for our products often requires
  that we increase our inventories and personnel. Customer demands that we purchase and maintain their Remanufactured Core
  inventory also requires the use of our working capital. The marketing and other allowances we typically grant our customers in
  connection with our new or expanded customer relationships adversely impact near-term revenues, profitability and associated
  cash flows from these arrangements. However, we believe the investment we make in these new or expanded customer
  relationships will improve our overall liquidity and cash flow from operations over time.

  Competition

  Our business is highly competitive. We compete with several large and medium-sized companies, including BBB Industries and
  Cardone Industries for hard parts, and AVL and Horiba for test solutions and diagnostic equipment, and a large number of smaller
  regional and specialty companies. We also compete with other overseas manufacturers, particularly those located in China who are
  increasing their operations and could become a significant competitive force in the future.

  We believe that the reputations for quality, reliability, and customer service that a supplier provides are significant factors in our
  customers’ purchase decisions. We continuously strive to increase our competitive and technical advantages as the industry and
  technologies rapidly evolve. Our advanced power emulators are protected by U.S. patents that provide us a strong competitive
  barrier for a large segment of the market and allow us to be lower cost and more efficient.

  We believe our ability to educate also helps to distinguish us from many of our competitors. We have created an online library of
  video courses, aimed at supporting our customers as they seek to train the next generation of technicians. We also offer live and
  web-based training courses via our education center within our Torrance, California headquarters. We believe our ability to provide
  quality replacement automotive parts, rapid and reliable delivery capabilities as well as promotional support also distinguishes us
  from many of our competitors. In addition, favorable pricing, our core exchange programs, and extended payment terms are also
  very important competitive factors in customers’ purchase decisions.

  We seek to protect our proprietary processes and other information by relying on trade secret laws and non-disclosure and
  confidentiality agreements with certain of our employees and other persons who have access to that information.

  Operations

  Production Process for Non-discretionary Replacement Parts. The majority of our products are remanufactured at our facilities
  in Mexico, Canada, and to a lesser extent in Malaysia. We continue to maintain production of certain remanufactured units that
  require specialized service and/or rapid turnaround in our Torrance, California facility. We also manufacture and assemble new
  products at our facilities in Malaysia and India. Our remanufacturing process begins with the receipt of Used Cores from our
  customers or core brokers. The Used Cores are evaluated for inventory control purposes and then sorted by part number. Each
  Used Core is completely disassembled into its fundamental components. The components are cleaned in an environmentally sound
  process that employs customized equipment and cleaning materials in accordance with the required specifications of the particular
  component. All components known to be subject to major wear and those components determined not to be reusable or repairable
  are replaced by new components. Non-salvageable components of the Used Core are sold as scrap.


                                                                      8

26/04/23, 09:07                     https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/918251/000114036122022893/brhc10038580_10k.htm
  Table of Contents

  After the cleaning process is complete, the salvageable components of the Used Core are inspected and tested as prescribed by our
  IATF 16949 and ISO 9001:2015 approved quality programs, which have been implemented throughout the production processes.
  IATF 16949 and ISO 9001:2015 are internationally recognized, world class, quality programs. Upon passage of all tests, which are
  monitored by designated quality control personnel, all the component parts are assembled in a work cell into a finished product.
  Inspection and testing are conducted at multiple stages of the remanufacturing process, and each finished product is inspected and
  tested on equipment designed to simulate performance under operating conditions. To maximize remanufacturing efficiency, we
  store component parts ready for assembly in our production facilities.

  Our remanufacturing processes combine product families with similar configurations into dedicated factory work cells. This
  remanufacturing process, known as “lean manufacturing,” eliminated a large number of inventory moves and the need to track
  inventory movement through the remanufacturing process. This lean manufacturing process has been fully implemented at our
  existing production facilities and we expect to implement this process at our recently acquired facilities. This manufacturing
  enables us to significantly reduce the time it takes to produce a finished product. We continue to explore opportunities for
  improving efficiencies in our remanufacturing process.

  Production Process for Test Solutions and Diagnostic Equipment. Our test solutions and diagnostic equipment are engineered
  and manufactured in North America at facilities in Toronto, Canada and Binghamton, New York, U.S. Our facility in Canada is
  certified under ISO 9001:2015 quality management system, which mandates that we foster continuous improvement to our
  manufacturing processes. Materials for custom systems are purchased in a “just-in-time” environment while materials for standard
  systems are purchased in economic quantities. All materials and components are inspected and tested when required. Certain
  components require certificates of compliance or test results from our vendors prior to shipping to us. Our manufacturing process
  combines skilled labor from certified and licensed technicians with raw materials, manufactured components, purchased
  components, and purchased capital components to complete our test solutions and diagnostic equipment. All test solutions and
  diagnostic equipment are inspected and tested per our quality control program, which has been approved by the ISO 9001:2015
  quality management system.

  Our facility in New York, U.S., manufactures test solutions and diagnostic equipment using purchased electronic and custom
  components that are primarily assembled at this facility. While some circuit card assemblies are handled by outside subcontractors,
  most of the assemblies are manufactured in-house along with the fabrication of electronic subassemblies. Quality control and
  testing is completed on these subassemblies prior to their final installation into the overall equipment rack that includes
  mechanical, electrical and thermal management operations. Final inspection and acceptance testing are performed to predefined
  procedures prior to the equipment being packaged in a crate for shipment.

  Used Cores. The majority of our Used Cores are obtained from customers through the core exchange programs. To supplement
  Used Cores received from our customers we purchase Used Cores from core brokers. Although this is not a primary source of
  Used Cores, it is a critical source for meeting our raw material demands. Remanufacturing consumes, on average, more than one
  Used Core for each remanufactured unit produced since not all Used Cores are reusable. The yield rates depend upon both the
  product and customer specifications.

  We recycle materials, including metal from the Used Cores and corrugated packaging, in keeping with our focus as a
  remanufacturer to lessen our footprint on the environment.

  Purchased Finished Goods. In addition to our remanufactured goods, we also purchase finished goods from various approved
  suppliers, including several located in Asia. We perform supplier qualification, product inspection and testing according to our
  IATF 16949 or ISO 9001:2015 certified quality systems to assure product quality levels. We also perform periodic site audits of
  our suppliers’ manufacturing facilities.


                                                                   9

  Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) and Human Capital

  Our Culture. Our Company was founded in 1968 on the values of integrity, common decency and respect for others. Our core
  values are Excellence, Passion/Productivity, Innovation/Integrity, Community and Quality (“EPICQ”) and characterize our daily
  corporate focus. These values are embodied in our Code of Ethics, which has been adopted by our Board of Directors to serve as a
  statement of principles to guide our decision-making and reinforce our commitment to these values in all aspects of our business.
  We believe that our commitment to our Company, our employees and the communities within which we operate has led to high
  employee satisfaction and low employee turnover, and our commitment to our customers, suppliers and business partners has
  resulted in high customer satisfaction, as evidenced by the customer awards that we routinely win, and decades-long customer
  relationships.

  Environmental. Environmental and sustainable processes have been our hallmark since the Company’s establishment. We take our
  commitment to environmental stewardship seriously. The use of Remanufactured Cores results in a substantial reduction of raw
  materials and energy consumption. With the potential to significantly reduce material and energy consumption, industry sources
  believe that remanufacturing is the most efficient and sustainable process for producing aftermarket replacement parts – making
  our business practices green by nature. See more information on this at investors.motorcarparts.com/esg. Highlights of our eco-
  friendly remanufacturing processes include:

            •     sorting the Used Cores returned by customers utilizing an innovative and efficient core-sorting process;
            •     reconditioning and re-utilizing durable components after passing rigorous testing processes;
            •     savings of raw materials due to a reduction in the required materials used in the remanufacturing production process,
                  compared with new product processes; and
            •     recycling of water, cardboard, and metal.

  Human Capital. We regard our team members as integral to our strategic growth and success. We recognize that safety, inclusion,
  and offering exciting opportunities are fundamental to facilitating high retention and satisfaction of high performance team
  members. Equally important, we provide competitive compensation and excellent benefit programs, and support numerous
  programs that build connections between our team members and their communities. We believe our team members share our
  corporate ethics and values, as demonstrated in their daily interactions with customers, co-workers, vendors, and the public at
  large.

  As of March 31, 2022, we employed approximately 5,800 people, with 400 people in the United States, 4,900 people in Mexico,
  200 people Canada, and 300 people in Malaysia and China. Approximately 5,400 people are production employees. We have non-
  union and unionized facilities. Approximately 4,800 production employees are covered by a local union. We believe we have a
  strong relationship with the union that represents our employees.

  Our facilities are located in labor markets with readily available access to skilled and unskilled workers. Our relationship and
  communication with our unionized and non-represented workforce is good.

  Inclusion and Diversity. Our board is ethnically diverse and comprised of 10 independent directors, including three women. We
  believe an inclusive workforce is critical to our success, with an ongoing focus on the hiring, retention, and advancement of
  women and other underrepresented ethnic groups. The Company employs 37% women and 63% men globally. In the United
  States, 76% of our workforce are considered ethnic minorities.

  Health, Safety and Wellness. The success of our business is connected to the safety and well-being of our team members and their
  families. We provide our employees and their families with flexible and convenient health and wellness programs – including
  protection and security to lessen concerns about missing work and the potential financial impact. Our programs are intended to
  support the physical and mental well-being with the tools and resources for employees to improve or maintain their health, and we
  encourage engagement in healthy behaviors for team members and their families.

  In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented numerous changes in the interest of our team members. All of these
  changes meet and/or exceed Centers for Disease Control, World Health Organization, and other government regulations. These
  programs involve providing employees with flexible working arrangements – including, where appropriate, the ability to work
  from home, and the implementation of numerous safety policies and practices at all of our facilities. Please see the discussion in
  Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” as well as in Item 1A “Risk
  Factors” for further information regarding the COVID-19 pandemic.

  Compensation and benefits. We provide competitive compensation and benefit programs that meet the needs of our employees,
  and are tailored to their local markets. In addition to wages and salaries, these programs may include annual cash bonuses, stock
  awards, a 401(k) Plan, healthcare, and insurance, and implemented methodologies to manage performance, provide feedback and
  develop talent.

  Social Responsibility. We are firmly committed to social responsibility. While safety, respect, and inclusion have always been
  fundamental to our company, these qualities are more important than ever given the global pandemic and the impact it is having on
  our employees, family members, and the community at large. Medical professionals are onsite or within close proximity to our
  operations, and management is doing everything possible to address the challenges. In addition, our socially responsible initiatives
  include subsidized food programs for certain employees, donations to community organizations, sponsorship of sport teams and
  weekend family events, which hopefully, will become possible again as our Company and the world recovers. In addition, we have
  plans to launch an Agri-farm organic food and community program in Mexico to enhance our social responsibility practices on a
  global basis.

  Information Security and Risk Oversight

  We have an information security risk program committed to regular risk management practices surrounding the protection of
  confidential data. This program includes various technical controls, including security monitoring, data leakage protection,
  network segmentation and access controls around the computer resources that house confidential or sensitive data. We have also
  implemented employee awareness training programs around phishing, malware, and other cyber risks. We continually evaluate the
  security environment surrounding the handling and control of our critical data and have instituted additional measures to help
  protect us from system intrusion or data breaches.

  Our Board of Directors appointed the Audit Committee with direct oversight of Company’s: (i) information security policies,
  including periodic assessment of risk of information security breach, training program, significant threat changes and
  vulnerabilities and monitoring metrics and (ii) effectiveness of information security policy implementation. Our Audit Committee
  is comprised entirely of independent directors, one of whom has significant work experience related to information security issues
  or oversight. Management will report information security instances to the Audit Committee as they occur, if material, and will
  provide a summary multiple times per year to the Audit Committee.

  Governmental Regulation

  Item 1A. Risk Factors

  While we believe the risk factors described below are all the material risks currently facing our business, additional risks we are
  not presently aware of or that we currently believe are immaterial may also impair our business operations. Our financial condition
  or results of operations could be materially and adversely impacted by these risks, and the trading price of our common stock could
  be adversely impacted by any of these risks. In assessing these risks, you should also refer to the other information included in or
  incorporated by reference into this Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto appearing
  elsewhere or incorporated by reference in this Form 10-K.

  Risks Related to Economic, Political and Health Conditions

  Developments in global and local conditions, such as slowing growth, inflation, the Russia/Ukraine conflict and the COVID-19
  pandemic, have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition, and the continuation of or worsening of
  such conditions could have a similar or worse impact.

  Several conditions have led to adverse impacts on the U.S. and global economies and created uncertainty regarding the potential
  effects on our employees, supply chain, operations, and customer demand. These conditions impact our operations and the
  operations of our customers, suppliers, and vendors because of quarantines, facility closures, travel, logistics restrictions and
  supply chain issues. The extent to which these conditions impact us will depend on numerous factors and future developments,
  which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including, but not limited to: (i) general economic and growth conditions, (ii)
  the impact of inflation on our expenses, (iii) the effects of the Russia/Ukraine conflict on international trade, customers, suppliers,
  and vendors, (iv) public health crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, (v) actions and stimulus measures adopted by local, state
  and federal governments, and (vi) the extent to which normal economic and operating conditions can resume. Even if some of
  these conditions subside, we may continue to experience adverse impacts to our business because of an economic recession or
  depression that has occurred or may occur in the future, as well as the lingering effects on logistics, supply chain and the social
  norms of society. We could experience adverse impacts from these conditions in a number of ways, including, but not limited to,
  the following which have occurred to some extent during this fiscal year:

  •         supply chain delays or stoppages due to shipping delays (cargo ship, train and truck shortages as well as staffing
            shortages) resulting in increased freight costs, closed supplier facilities or distribution centers, reduced workforces,
            scarcity of raw materials and scrutiny or embargoing of goods produced in infected areas;
  •         reduced and/or deferred consumer demand for our products as a result of the economic downturn;
  •         change in demand for or availability of our products as a result of our customers modifying their restocking, fulfillment,
            or shipping practices;
  •         increased raw material, and other input costs resulting from market volatility;
  •         increased working capital needs and/or an increase in trade accounts receivable write-offs as a result of increased financial
            pressures on our suppliers or customers; and
  •         fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates or interest rates resulting from market uncertainties.

  At this time, we are unable to predict accurately the impact these conditions will have on our business and financial condition in
  the future.

  Unfavorable economic conditions may adversely affect our business.

  Adverse changes in economic conditions, including inflation, recession, increased fuel prices, tariffs, and unemployment levels,
  availability of consumer credit, taxation or instability in the financial markets or credit markets may either lower demand for our
  products or increase our operational costs, or both. In addition, elections and other changes in the political landscape could have
  similar effects. Such conditions may also materially impact our customers, suppliers and other parties with whom we do business.
  Our revenue will be adversely affected if demand for our products declines. The impact of unfavorable economic conditions may
  also impair the ability of our customers to pay for products they have purchased. As a result, reserves for doubtful accounts and
  write-offs of accounts receivables may increase and failure to collect a significant portion of amounts due on those receivables
  could have a material adverse effect upon our business, results of operations, and financial condition. In addition, we also get
  pressure from our suppliers to pay them faster and our customers to pay us slower, which could impact our cash flows.


                                                                     12

  Risks Related to Our Business and Industry

  We rely on a few large customers for a majority of our business, and the loss of any of these customers, significant changes in
  the prices, marketing allowances or other important terms provided to any of these customers or adverse developments with
  respect to the financial condition of these customers could reduce our net income and operating results.

  Our net sales are concentrated among a small number of large customers. Sales to our three largest customers in the aggregate
  represented 85%, and sales to our largest customer represented 38% of our net sales during fiscal 2022. We are under ongoing
  pressure from our major customers to offer lower prices, extended payment terms, increased marketing and other allowances and
  other terms more favorable to these customers because our sales to these customers are concentrated, and the market in which we
  operate is very competitive. These customer demands have put continued pressure on our operating margins and profitability,
  resulted in periodic contract renegotiation to provide more favorable prices and terms to these customers and significantly
  increased our working capital needs. In addition, this customer concentration leaves us vulnerable to any adverse change in the
  financial condition of these customers. Changes in terms with, significant allowances for and collections from these customers
  could affect our operating results and cash flows. The loss of or a significant decline in sales to any of these customers could
  adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.

  Failure to compete effectively could reduce our market share and significantly harm our financial performance.

  Our industry is highly competitive, and our success depends on our ability to compete with suppliers of automotive aftermarket
  products, some of which may have substantially greater financial, marketing and other resources than we do. The automotive
  aftermarket industry is highly competitive, and our success depends on our ability to compete with domestic and international
  suppliers of automotive aftermarket products. Due to the diversity of our product offering, we compete with several large and
  medium-sized companies, including BBB Industries and Cardone Industries for hard parts, and AVL and Horiba for test solutions
  and diagnostic equipment and a large number of smaller regional and specialty companies and numerous category specific
  competitors. In addition, we face competition from original equipment manufacturers, which, through their automotive dealerships,
  supply many of the same types of replacement parts we sell.

  Some of our competitors may have larger customer bases and significantly greater financial, technical and marketing resources
  than we do. These factors may allow our competitors to:

  •         respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements by devoting
            greater resources than we can to the development, promotion and sale of automotive aftermarket products;
  •         engage in more extensive research and development; and
  •         spend more money and resources on marketing and promotion.

  In addition, other overseas competitors, particularly those located in China, are increasing their operations and could become a
  significant competitive force in the future. Increased competition could put additional pressure on us to reduce prices or take other
  actions, which may have an adverse effect on our operating results. We may also lose significant customers or lines of business to
  competitors.


                                                                    13

  If we do not respond appropriately, the evolution of the automotive industry could adversely affect our business.

  The automotive industry is increasingly focused on the development of hybrid and electric vehicles and of advanced driver
  assistance technologies, with the goal of developing and introducing a commercially-viable, fully-automated driving experience.
  There has also been an increase in consumer preferences for mobility on demand services, such as car and ride sharing, as opposed
  to automobile ownership, which may result in a long-term reduction in the number of vehicles per capita. In addition, some
  industry participants are exploring transportation through alternatives to automobiles. These evolving areas have also attracted
  increased competition from entrants outside the traditional automotive industry. If we do not continue to innovate and develop, or
  acquire, new and compelling products that capitalize upon new technologies in response to consumer preferences, it could have an
  adverse impact on our results of operations.

  Work stoppages, production shutdowns and similar events could significantly disrupt our business.

  Because the automotive industry relies heavily on just-in-time delivery of components during the assembly and manufacture of
  vehicles, a work stoppage or production shutdown at one or more of our manufacturing and assembly facilities could have adverse
  effects on our business. During fiscal 2022, our production capacity at our Malaysian facility was impacted due to local
  government mandated restrictions in connection with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Due to this reduction in production
  capacity, we were required to outsource certain finished goods purchases to meet demand, which resulted in incremental tariffs.
  Similarly, if one or more of our customers were to experience a work stoppage, that customer would likely halt or limit purchases
  of our products. We have also experienced significant disruptions in the supply of several key components from Asia due to work
  stoppages, production shutdowns, government closures, and other supply chain issues at many of our suppliers, leading to an
  adverse effect on our financial results.

  Interruptions or delays in obtaining component parts could impair our business and adversely affect our operating results.

  In our remanufacturing processes, we obtain Used Cores, primarily through the core exchange programs with our customers, and
  component parts from third-party manufacturers. To supplement Used Cores received from our customers we purchase Used Cores
  from core brokers. Historically, the Used Core returned from customers together with purchases from core brokers have provided
  us with an adequate supply of Used Cores. If there was a significant disruption in the supply of Used Cores, whether as a result of
  increased Used Core acquisitions by existing or new competitors or otherwise, our operating activities could be materially and
  adversely impacted. In addition, a number of the other components used in the remanufacturing process are available from a very
  limited number of suppliers. We are, as a result, vulnerable to any disruption in component supply, and any meaningful disruption
  in this supply would materially and adversely impact our operating results.

  Increases in the market prices of key component raw materials could increase the cost of our products and negatively impact
  our profitability.

  In light of the continuous pressure on pricing which we have experienced from our large customers, we may not be able to recoup
  the higher costs of our products due to changes in the prices of raw materials, including, but not limited to, aluminum, copper,
  steel, and cardboard. If we are unable to recover a substantial portion of our raw materials from Used Cores returned to us by our
  customers through the core exchange programs, the prices of Used Cores that we purchase may reflect the impact of changes in the
  cost of raw materials. Sustained raw material price increases has had an impact on our product costs and profitability to date, but
  we are unable to determine the overall impact, in the future, at this time.


                                                                   14

  Our financial results are affected by automotive parts failure rates that are outside of our control.

  Our operating results are affected over the long term by automotive parts failure rates. These failure rates are impacted by a
  number of factors outside of our control, including product designs that have resulted in greater reliability, the number of miles
  driven by consumers, and the average age of vehicles on the road. A reduction in the failure rates of automotive parts would
  adversely affect our sales and profitability.

  Our reliance on foreign suppliers for some of the automotive parts we sell to our customers or included in our products
  presents risks to our business.

  A significant portion of automotive parts and components we use in our remanufacturing process are imported from suppliers
  located outside the U.S., including China and other countries in Asia. As a result, we are subject to various risks of doing business
  in foreign markets and importing products from abroad, such as the following, which we have experienced in the last fiscal year:

  •         significant delays in the delivery of cargo due to port security and over-crowding considerations;
  •         imposition of duties, taxes, tariffs or other charges on imports;
  •         financial or political instability in any of the countries in which our product is manufactured;
  •         potential recalls or cancellations of orders for any product that does not meet our quality standards;
  •         disruption of imports by labor disputes or strikes and local business practices;
  •         inability of our non-U.S. suppliers to obtain adequate credit or access liquidity to finance their operations; and
  •         natural disasters, disease epidemics and health related concerns, which could result in closed factories, reduced
            workforces, scarcity of raw materials and scrutiny or embargoing of goods produced in infected areas.

  It is also possible, in the future, that we may experience the following risks related to doing business in foreign markets and
  importing products from abroad, such as the following:

  •         imposition of new legislation relating to import quotas or other restrictions that may limit the quantity of our product that
            may be imported into the U.S. from countries or regions where we do business;
  •         political or military conflict involving the U.S., which could cause a delay in the transportation of our products and an
            increase in transportation costs;
  •         heightened terrorism security concerns, which could subject imported goods to additional, more frequent or more
            thorough inspections, leading to delays in deliveries or impoundment of goods for extended periods; and
  •         our ability to enforce any agreements with our foreign suppliers.

  Any of the foregoing factors, or a combination of them, could increase the cost or reduce the supply of products available to us and
  materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.

  In addition, because we depend on independent third parties to manufacture a significant portion of our wheel hub, brake-related
  products, and other purchased finished goods, we cannot be certain that we will not experience operational difficulties with such
  manufacturers, such as reductions in the availability of production capacity, errors in complying with merchandise specifications,
  insufficient quality controls and failure to meet production deadlines or increases in manufacturing costs.


                                                                     15

  An increase in the cost or a disruption in the flow of our imported products may significantly decrease our sales and profits.

  Merchandise manufactured offshore represents a significant portion of our total product purchases. A disruption in the shipping or
  cost of such merchandise may significantly decrease our sales and profits. In addition, if imported merchandise becomes more
  expensive or unavailable, the transition to alternative sources may not occur in time to meet our demands. Merchandise from
  alternative sources may also be of lesser quality and more expensive than those we currently import. Risks associated with our
  reliance on imported merchandise include disruptions in the shipping and importation or increase in the costs of imported products.
  For example, common risks include:

  •         raw material shortages;
  •         problems with oceanic shipping, including shipping container shortages;
  •         increased customs inspections of import shipments or other factors causing delays in shipments; and
  •         increases in shipping rates, all of which we experienced.

  As well as the following common risks, which we may experience in the future:

  •         work stoppages;
  •         strikes and political unrest;
  •         economic crises;
  •         international disputes and wars;
  •         loss of “most favored nation” trading status by the U. S. in relations to a particular foreign country;
  •         import duties; and
  •         import quotas and other trade sanctions.

  Products manufactured overseas and imported into the U.S. and other countries are subject to import restrictions and duties, which
  could delay their delivery or increase their cost. Following an audit in fiscal 2019, the U.S. Customs and Border Protection stated
  that it believed that we owed additional duties of approximately $17 million from 2011 through mid-2018 relating to products that
  we imported from Mexico. We do not believe that this amount is correct and believe that we have numerous defenses and are
  disputing this amount vigorously. We cannot assure you that the U.S. Customs and Border Protection will agree or that we will not
  need to accrue or pay additional amounts in the future.

  Our operating results may continue to fluctuate significantly.

  We have experienced significant variations in our annual and quarterly results of operations. These fluctuations have resulted from
  many factors, including shifts in the demand and pricing for our products, general economic conditions, including changes in
  prevailing interest rates, and the introduction of new products. Our gross profit percentage fluctuates due to numerous factors,
  some of which are outside of our control. These factors include the timing and level of marketing allowances provided to our
  customers, actual sales during the relevant period, pricing strategies, the mix of products sold during a reporting period, and
  general market and competitive conditions. We also incur allowances, accruals, charges and other expenses that differ from period
  to period based on changes in our business, which causes our operating income to fluctuate.

  Regulations related to conflict minerals could adversely impact our business.

  The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (“Dodd-Frank”) contains provisions to improve transparency
  and accountability concerning the supply of certain minerals, known as “conflict minerals”, originating from the Democratic
  Republic of Congo (“DRC”) and adjoining countries. These rules could adversely affect the sourcing, supply, and pricing of
  materials used in our products, as the number of suppliers who provide conflict-free minerals may be limited. We may also suffer
  reputational harm if we determine that certain of our products contain minerals not determined to be conflict-free or if we are
  unable to modify our products to avoid the use of such materials. We may also face challenges in satisfying customers who may
  require that our products be certified as containing conflict-free minerals.

  The products we manufacture or contract to manufacture contain small quantities of Tin and Gold. We manufacture or contract to
  manufacture one product with small quantities of Tantalum. For the reporting year ending December 31, 2021, we surveyed 283
  smelters, refiners, or metal processing facilities for these minerals that are, or could be, in our supply chain. Of these, 69% were
  validated as conflict-free, per publicly available information on the Conflict Free Sourcing Initiative website. We have not been
  able to ascertain the conflict-free status of the remaining smelters or refiners.


                                                                     16

  Table of Contents

  Our strategy for managing risks associated with conflict minerals in products includes continuing to encourage our suppliers to
  engage in conflict-free sourcing and obtaining data from our suppliers that is more applicable to the products we purchase. We
  continue to monitor progress on industry efforts to ascertain whether some facilities that suppliers identified are actually smelters.
  We do not believe conflict minerals pose risk to our operations. We are a member of the Automobile Industry Action Group
  (AIAG) and support their efforts in the conflict minerals area.

  Natural disasters or other disruptions in our business in California and Baja California, Mexico could increase our operating
  expenses or cause us to lose revenues.

  A substantial portion of our operations are located in California and Baja California, Mexico, including our headquarters,
  remanufacturing and warehouse facilities. Any natural disaster, such as an earthquake, or other damage to our facilities from
  weather, fire or other events could cause us to lose inventory, delay delivery of orders to customers, incur additional repair-related
  expenses, disrupt our operations or otherwise harm our business. These events could also disrupt our information systems, which
  would harm our ability to manage our operations worldwide and compile and report financial information. As a result, we could
  incur additional expenses or liabilities or lose revenues, which could exceed any insurance coverage and would adversely affect
  our financial condition and results of operations.

  Our past material weakness, and any future failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, may affect
  our ability to accurately report our financial results and could materially and adversely affect the market price of our common
  stock.

  Under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, we must maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial
  reporting, which requires significant resources and management oversight. Effective internal and disclosure controls are necessary
  for us to provide reliable financial reports and effectively prevent fraud and to operate successfully as a public company. If we
  cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, our reputation and operating results would be harmed. We cannot assure
  you that our internal control over financial reporting will be effective in the future or that other material weakness will not be
  discovered in the future. Any failure to maintain effective controls or timely effect any necessary improvement of our internal and
  disclosure controls could harm operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations, which could affect our ability
  to remain listed with the NASDAQ Global Select Market or subject us to adverse regulatory consequences. Ineffective internal and
  disclosure controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which would likely have a
  negative effect on the trading price of our stock.

  Risks Related to Our Overseas Operations

  Our offshore remanufacturing and logistic activities expose us to increased political and economic risks and place a greater
  burden on management to achieve quality standards.

  Our overseas operations, especially our operations in Mexico, increase our exposure to political, criminal or economic instability
  in the host countries and to currency fluctuations. Risks are inherent in international operations, including:

  •         exchange controls and currency restrictions;
  •         currency fluctuations and devaluations;
  •         changes in local economic conditions;
  •         repatriation restrictions (including the imposition or increase of withholding and other taxes on remittances and other
            payments by foreign subsidiaries);
  •         global sovereign uncertainty and hyperinflation in certain foreign countries;


                                                                    17

  •         laws and regulations relating to export and import restrictions;
  •         exposure to government actions;
  •         increased required employment related costs; and
  •         exposure to local political or social unrest including resultant acts of war, terrorism or similar events.

  These and other factors may have a material adverse effect on our offshore activities and on our business, results of operations and
  financial condition. Our overall success as a business depends substantially upon our ability to manage our foreign operations. We
  may not continue to succeed in developing and implementing policies and strategies that are effective in each location where we do
  business, and failure to do so could materially and adversely impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition.

  Unfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuations could adversely affect us.

  We are exposed to market risk from material movements in foreign exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the currencies of
  the foreign countries in which we operate. In fiscal 2022, approximately 24% of our total expenses were in currencies other than
  the U.S. dollar. As a result of our extensive operations in Mexico, our primary risk relates to changes in the rates between the U.S.
  dollar and the Mexican peso. To mitigate this currency risk, we enter into forward foreign exchange contracts to exchange U.S.
  dollars for Mexican pesos. We also enter into forward foreign exchange contracts to exchange U.S. dollars for Chinese yuan in
  order to mitigate risk related to our purchases and payments to our Chinese vendors. The extent to which we use forward foreign
  exchange contracts is periodically reviewed in light of our estimate of market conditions and the terms and length of anticipated
  requirements. The use of derivative financial instruments allows us to reduce our exposure to the risk that the eventual net cash
  outflow resulting from funding the expenses of the foreign operations will be materially affected by changes in the exchange rates.
  We do not engage in currency speculation or hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. These contracts generally
  expire in a year or less. Any change in the fair value of foreign exchange contracts is accounted for as an increase or decrease to
  “foreign exchange impact of lease liabilities and forward contracts” in the consolidated statements of operations. We recorded a
  non-cash loss of $316,000 and a non-cash gain of $7,713,000 due to the change in the fair value of the forward foreign currency
  exchange contracts during fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively. In addition, we recorded gains of $1,989,000 and $9,893,000 in
  connection with the remeasurement of foreign currency-denominated lease liabilities during fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively.

  Changes in trade policy and other factors beyond our control could materially adversely affect our business.

  The former presidential administration advocated for greater restrictions on international trade generally, including with respect to
  the North American Free Trade Agreement (“NAFTA”) and the World Trade Organization (the “WTO”). In December 2019, the
  United States, Mexico and Canada signed the amended United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (the “USMCA”), which replaced
  NAFTA. In July 2020, the U.S. notified the United Nations of its intention to withdraw from the WTO. While the current
  presidential administration has rejoined the WTO, it remains difficult to predict what affect the USMCA, the WTO or other trade
  agreements and organizations will have on our business. If the U.S. were to withdraw from or materially modify any other
  international trade agreements to which it is a party or if the U.S. imposes significant additional tariffs on imports from China or
  other restrictions, it could have an adverse impact on our business.

  Possible new tariffs that might be imposed by the United States government could have a material adverse effect on our results
  of operations.

  The U.S. government has placed tariffs on certain goods imported from China and may impose new tariffs on goods imported from
  China and other countries, including products that we import. In retaliation, China has responded by imposing tariffs on a wide
  range of products imported from the U.S. and by adjusting the value of its currency. If renegotiations of existing tariffs are
  unsuccessful or additional tariffs or trade restrictions are implemented by the U.S. or other countries in connection with a global
  trade war, the resulting escalation of trade tensions could have a material adverse effect on world trade and the global economy.
  Even in the absence of further tariffs or trade restrictions, the related uncertainty and the market’s fear of an economic slowdown
  could lead to a decrease in consumer spending and we may experience lower net sales than expected. Reduced net sales may result
  in reduced operating cash flows if we are not able to appropriately manage inventory levels or leverage expenses.

  Risks Related to Our Indebtedness

  Our debt can impact our operating results and cash flows and limit our operations.

  As of March 31, 2022, we had $171,694,000 of debt outstanding, most of which is at variable interest rates. Fluctuations in those
  rates could impact our operating results and cash flows. In particular, interest rates have been rising recently, which increases our
  interest expense. In addition, our credit facility has covenants that limit aspects of our operations. We may also incur additional
  debt in the future, which could further increase our leverage, reduce our cash flow or further restrict our business.

  Our lenders may not waive future defaults under our credit agreements.

  Our credit agreement with our lenders contains certain financial and other covenants. If we fail to meet any of these covenants in
  the future, there is no assurance that our lenders will waive any such defaults. If obtained, any such waiver may impose significant
  costs or covenants on us. In addition, as the capital markets get more volatile, it may become more difficult to obtain such waivers
  or refinance our debt.

  Risks Related to Owning Our Stock

  Our stock price may be volatile and could decline substantially.

  Our stock price has fluctuated in the past and may decline substantially in the future as a result of developments in our business,
  the volatile nature of the stock market, and other factors beyond our control. Our stock price and the stock market generally has,
  from time to time, experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations. Many factors may cause the market price for our common
  stock to decline, including: (i) our operating results failing to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors in any
  period, (ii) downward revisions in securities analysts’ estimates, (iii) market perceptions concerning our future earnings prospects,
  (iv) public or private sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock, (v) adverse changes in general market
  conditions or economic trends, and (vi) market shocks generally or in our industry, such as what has recently occurred.

  General Risk Factors

  We may continue to make strategic acquisitions of other companies or businesses and these acquisitions introduce significant
  risks and uncertainties, including risks related to integrating the acquired businesses and achieving benefits from the
  acquisitions.

  In order to position ourselves to take advantage of growth opportunities, we have made, and may continue to make, strategic
  acquisitions that involve significant risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties include:

  •         the difficulty in integrating newly-acquired businesses and operations in an efficient and effective manner;
  •         the challenges in achieving strategic objectives, cost savings and other benefits from acquisitions;
  •         the potential loss of key employees of the acquired businesses;
  •         the risk of diverting the attention of senior management from our operations;
  •         risks associated with integrating financial reporting and internal control systems;
  •         difficulties in expanding information technology systems and other business processes to accommodate the acquired
            businesses; and
  •         future impairments of any goodwill of an acquired business.


                                                                    19

  We may also incur significant expenses to pursue and consummate acquisitions. Any of the foregoing, or a combination of them,
  could cause us to incur additional expenses and materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of
  operations, or liquidity.

  Increasing attention to environmental, social, and governance matters may impact our business, financial results, or stock
  price.

  In recent years, increasing attention has been given to corporate activities related to environmental, social, and governance
  (“ESG”) matters in public discourse and the investment community. A number of advocacy groups, both domestically and
  internationally, have campaigned for governmental and private action to promote change at public companies related to ESG
  matters, including through the investment and voting practices of investment advisers, public pension funds, universities, and other
  members of the investing community. These activities include increasing attention and demands for action related to climate
  change and promoting the use of energy saving building materials. A failure to comply with investor or customer expectations and
  standards, which are evolving, or if we are perceived to not have responded appropriately to the growing concern for ESG issues,
  regardless of whether there is a legal requirement to do so, could also cause reputational harm to our business and could have a
  material adverse effect on us.

  If our technology and telecommunications systems were to fail, or we were not able to successfully anticipate, invest in or adopt
  technological advances in our industry, it could have an adverse effect on our operations.

  We rely on computer and telecommunications systems to communicate with our customers and vendors and manage our business.
  The temporary or permanent loss of our computer and telecommunications equipment and software systems, through casualty,
  operating malfunction, software virus or service provider failure, could disrupt our operations. In addition, our future growth may
  require additional investment in our systems to keep up with technological advances in our industry. If we are not able to invest in
  or adopt changes to our systems, or such upgrades take longer or cost more than anticipated, our business, financial condition and
  operating results may be adversely affected.

  Cyber-attacks or other breaches of information technology security could adversely impact our business and operations.

  The incidence of cyber-attacks and other breaches of information technology security have increased worldwide. Cyber-attacks or
  other breaches of network or information technology security may cause equipment failure or disruption to our operations. Such
  attacks, which include the use of malware, computer viruses and other means for disruption or unauthorized access, on companies
  have increased in frequency, scope and potential harm in recent years. While, to the best of our knowledge, we have not been
  subject to cyber-attacks or to other cyber incidents which, individually or in the aggregate, have been material to our operations or
  financial conditions, the preventive actions we take to reduce the risk of cyber incidents and protect our information technology
  and networks may be insufficient to repel a major cyber-attack in the future. To the extent that any disruption or security breach
  results in a loss or damage to our data or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information, it could cause significant damage to
  our reputation, affect our relationship with our customers, suppliers and employees, and lead to claims against us and ultimately
  harm our business. Additionally, we may be required to incur significant costs to protect against damage caused by these
  disruptions or security breaches in the future. While we maintain specific cyber insurance coverage, which may apply in the event
  of various breach scenarios, the amount of coverage may not be adequate in any particular case. Furthermore, because cyber threat
  scenarios are inherently difficult to predict and can take many forms, some breaches may not be covered under our cyber insurance
  coverage.

  Weakness in conditions in the global credit markets and macroeconomic factors could adversely affect our financial condition
  and results of operations.

  Any weakness in the credit markets could result in significant constraints on liquidity and availability of borrowing terms from
  lenders and accounts payable terms with vendors. Modest economic growth in most major industrial countries in the world and
  uncertain prospects for continued growth threaten to cause tightening of the credit markets, more stringent lending standards and
  terms, and higher interest rates. The persistence of these conditions could have a material adverse effect on our borrowings and the
  availability, terms and cost of such borrowings. In addition, deterioration in the U.S. economy could materially and adversely
  impact our operating results.

  business. Following an audit in fiscal 2019, the U.S. Customs and Border Protection stated that it believed that we owed additional
  duties of approximately $17 million from 2011 through mid-2018 relating to products that we imported from Mexico. We do not
  believe that this amount is correct and believe that we have numerous defenses and are disputing this amount vigorously. We
  cannot assure you that the U.S. Customs and Border Protection will agree or that we will not need to accrue or pay additional
  amounts in the future.

  The following discussion contains forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, our expectations and statements
  regarding our outlook and future revenues, expenses, results of operations, liquidity, plans, strategies and objectives of
  management and any assumptions underlying any of the foregoing. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected
  in the forward-looking statements. Our forward-looking statements and factors that might cause future actual results to differ
  materially from our recent results or those projected in the forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, those
  discussed in the section titled “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” and “Risk Factors” of this Annual
  Report on Form 10-K. Except as required by law, we assume no obligation to update the forward-looking statements or our risk
  factors for any reason.

  Management Overview

  We have a multi-pronged platform for growth within the automotive aftermarket for non-discretionary replacement hard parts and
  test solutions. In addition, we offer diagnostic equipment applications focused on the fast-evolving electric mobility markets. Our
  investments in infrastructure and human resources during the past few years reflects the significant expansion of manufacturing
  capacity to support multiple product lines and continues to be transformative and scalable. These investments included (i) a
  410,000 square foot distribution center, (ii) two buildings totaling 372,000 square feet for remanufacturing and core sorting of
  brake calipers, and (iii) the realignment of production at our initial 312,000 square foot facility in Mexico.

  New products introduced through our growth strategies include: (i) the addition of brake calipers in August 2019; (ii) alternators
  and starters for heavy-duty truck, industrial, marine, and agriculture applications, through an acquisition in January 2019; (iii)
  brake power boosters in August 2016; and (iv) turbochargers through an acquisition in July 2016. In addition, our test solutions and
  diagnostic equipment include: (a) the design and manufacture of test solutions and diagnostic equipment for alternators, starters,
  belt-start generators (stop start and hybrid technology), and electric power trains for electric vehicles through an acquisition in July
  2017 and (b) the design and manufacture of advanced power emulators (AC and DC) and custom power electronic products for the
  automotive and aerospace industries through an acquisition in December 2018.

       •    Equally important, we continued our social responsibility initiatives with plans to launch an Agri-farm organic food and
            community program in Mexico and continued our focus on opportunities to enhance our Environmental, Social and
            Governance practices on a global basis.

  Impact of the Novel Coronavirus (“COVID-19”)

  The COVID-19 pandemic has spread globally and created significant volatility, uncertainty and economic disruption in many
  countries, including the countries in which we operate. National, state and local governments in these countries continue to
  implement a variety of measures in response that have the effect of restricting or limiting, among other activities, the operations of
  certain businesses.

  We continue to experience disruptions with worldwide supply chain and logistics services. We are unable to predict accurately the
  ultimate long-term impact that COVID-19 will have on our business and financial condition. While the near-term outlook appears
  positive, any additional government shutdowns or the emergence and spread of new variants of the virus, including the Delta or
  Omicron variant, the likelihood of a resurgence of positive cases, the development, availability and public acceptance of effective
  treatments and vaccines, the speed at which such vaccines are administered, the efficacy of current vaccines against evolving
  strains or variants of the virus, could negatively impact our business and financial condition.

  There have been no serious outbreaks in any of our production facilities; however, a serious outbreak could affect our production
  capabilities. We experienced inefficiencies in operations due to the implementation of additional personnel safety measures
  throughout our facilities.

  Enhanced levels of communication at all levels within the organization are critical to address the ever-changing landscape brought
  on by COVID-19, especially with most of our office staff continuing to work from home partially. Such efforts have included,
  additional board check-in meetings, executive committee meetings, and town hall style communications with all employees, as
  appropriate.

  We continue to incur costs as a result of COVID-19, including employee costs, such as expanded benefits and frontline incentives,
  and other operating costs associated with the provision of personal protective equipment, which have negatively impacted our
  profitability. These expanded benefits, supply costs and other COVID-19 related costs resulted in total expense, included in cost of
  goods sold and operating expenses in the consolidated statements of operations, of $3,368,000 and $7,316,000 during fiscal 2022
  and 2021, respectively. Our Asian subsidiaries received $71,000 and $171,000 from their local assistance programs during fiscal
  2022 and 2021, respectively. We received payments from the Canadian Government under the Canadian Emergency Wage Subsidy
  program of $1,130,000 during fiscal 2021. These payments are recorded as a reduction of cost of goods sold and operating
  expenses in the consolidated statements of income.

  Segment Reporting

  Pursuant to the guidance provided under the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification
  (“ASC”) for segment reporting, we have identified our chief operating decision maker (“CODM”), reviewed the documents used
  by the CODM, and understand how such documents are used by the CODM to make financial and operating decisions. We have
  determined through this review process that our business comprises three separate operating segments. All of the operating
  segments meet all the aggregation criteria, and are aggregated.


                                                                    26

  Critical Accounting Policies

  We prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, in the
  United States. Our significant accounting policies are discussed in detail below and in Note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial
  statements.

  In preparing our consolidated financial statements, we use estimates and assumptions for matters that are inherently uncertain. We
  base our estimates on historical experiences and reasonable assumptions. Our use of estimates and assumptions affect the reported
  amounts of assets, liabilities and the amount and timing of revenues and expenses we recognize for and during the reporting
  period. Actual results may differ from our estimates.

  There continues to be uncertainty and disruption in the global economy and financial markets in connection with the COVID-19
  pandemic. We are not currently aware of any specific event or circumstance that would require an update to our estimates or
  judgments or a revision of the carrying value of our assets or liabilities as of March 31, 2022. These estimates may change, as new
  events occur and additional information is obtained. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different
  assumptions or conditions.

  Our remanufacturing operations include core exchange programs for the core portion of the finished goods. The Used Cores that
  we acquire and are returned to us from our customers are a necessary raw material for remanufacturing. We also offer our
  customers marketing and other allowances that impact revenue recognition. These elements of our business give rise to more
  complex accounting than many businesses our size or larger.

  Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements

  In December 2019, the FASB issued guidance that simplifies the accounting for income taxes, eliminates certain exceptions within
  ASC 740, Income Taxes, and clarifies certain aspects of the current guidance to promote consistent application. This guidance is
  effective for annual and interim periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020. The adoption of this guidance on April
  1, 2021 did not have any material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

  Inventory

  Inventory is comprised of: (i) Used Core and component raw materials, (ii) work-in-process, and (iii) remanufactured and
  purchased finished goods.

  Used Core, component raw materials, and purchased finished goods are stated at the lower of average cost or net realizable value.

  Work-in-process is in various stages of production and is valued at the average cost of Used Cores and component raw materials
  issued to work orders still open, including allocations of labor and overhead costs. Historically, work-in-process inventory has not
  been material compared to the total inventory balance.

  Remanufactured finished goods include: (i) the Used Core cost and (ii) the cost of component raw materials, and allocations of
  labor and variable and fixed overhead costs (the “Unit Cost”). The allocations of labor and variable and fixed overhead costs are
  based on the actual use of the production facilities over the prior 12 months which approximates normal capacity. This method
  prevents the distortion in allocated labor and overhead costs that would occur during short periods of abnormally low or high
  production. In addition, we exclude certain unallocated overhead such as severance costs, duplicative facility overhead costs, start-
  up costs, training, and spoilage from the calculation and expenses these unallocated overhead costs as period costs. Purchased
  finished goods also include an allocation of fixed overhead costs.

  The estimate of net realizable value is subjective and based on our judgment and knowledge of current industry demand and
  management’s projections of industry demand. The estimates may, therefore, be revised if there are changes in the overall market
  for our products or market changes that in our judgment impact our ability to sell or liquidate potentially excess or obsolete
  inventory. Net realizable value is determined at least quarterly as follows:

  •     Net realizable value for finished goods by customer, by product line are determined based on the agreed upon selling price
        with the customer for a product in the trailing 12 months. We compare the average selling price, including any discounts and
        allowances, to the finished goods cost of on-hand inventory, less any reserve for excess and obsolete inventory. Any
        reduction of value is recorded as cost of goods sold in the period in which the revaluation is identified.


                                                                   27

  •     Net realizable value for Used Cores are determined based on current core purchase prices from core brokers to the extent that
        core purchases in the trailing 12 months are significant. Remanufacturing consumes, on average, more than one Used Core
        for each remanufactured unit produced since not all Used Cores are reusable. The yield rates depend upon both the product
        and customer specifications. We purchase Used Cores from core brokers to supplement our yield rates and Used Cores not
        returned under the core exchange programs. We also consider the net selling price our customers have agreed to pay for Used
        Cores that are not returned under our core exchange programs to assess whether Used Core cost exceeds Used Core net
        realizable value on a by customer, by product line basis. Any reduction of core cost is recorded as cost of goods sold in the
        period in which the revaluation is identified.

  •     We record an allowance for potentially excess and obsolete inventory based upon recent sales history, the quantity of
        inventory on-hand, and a forecast of potential use of the inventory. We periodically review inventory to identify excess
        quantities and part numbers that are experiencing a reduction in demand. Any part numbers with quantities identified during
        this process are reserved for at rates based upon our judgment, historical rates, and consideration of possible scrap and
        liquidation values which may be as high as 100% of cost if no liquidation market exists for the part. As a result of this
        process, we recorded reserves for excess and obsolete inventory of $13,520,000 and $13,246,000 at March 31, 2022 and
        2021, respectively.

  We record vendor discounts as a reduction of inventories and are recognized as a reduction to cost of sales as the inventories are
  sold.

  Inventory Unreturned

  Inventory unreturned represents our estimate, based on historical data and prospective information provided directly by the
  customer, of finished goods shipped to customers that we expect to be returned, under our general right of return policy, after the
  balance sheet date. Inventory unreturned includes only the Unit Cost of a finished goods. The return rate is calculated based on
  expected returns within the normal operating cycle, which is generally one year. As such, the related amounts are classified in
  current assets. Inventory unreturned is valued in the same manner as our finished goods inventory.

  Contract Assets

  Contract assets consists of: (i) the core portion of the finished goods shipped to customers, (ii) upfront payments to customers in
  connection with customer contracts, (iii) core premiums paid to customers, (iv) finished goods premiums paid to customers, and
  (v) long-term core inventory deposits.

  Remanufactured Cores held at customers’ locations as a part of the finished goods sold to the customer are classified as long-term
  contract assets. These assets are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value of Used Cores on hand (See Inventory above).
  For these Remanufactured Cores, we expect the finished good containing the Remanufactured Core to be returned under our
  general right of return policy or a similar Used Core to be returned to us by the customer, under our core exchange programs, in
  each case for credit. Remanufactured Cores and Used Cores returned by consumers to our customers but not yet returned to us are
  classified as “Cores expected to be returned by customers”, which are included in short-term contract assets until we physically
  receive them during our normal operating cycle, which is generally one year.

  Upfront payments to customers represent the marketing allowances, such as sign-on bonuses, slotting fees, and promotional
  allowances provided to our customers. These allowances are recognized as an asset and amortized over the appropriate period of
  time as a reduction of revenue if we expect to generate future revenues associated with the upfront payment. If we do not expect to
  generate additional revenue, then the upfront payment is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations when payment
  occurs as a reduction of revenue. Upfront payments expected to be amortized during our normal operating cycle, which is
  generally one year, are classified as short-term contract assets.


                                                                    28

  Core premiums paid to customers represent the difference between the Remanufactured Core acquisition price paid to customers
  generally in connection with new business, and the related Used Core cost, which is treated as an asset and recognized as a
  reduction of revenue through the later of the date at which related revenue is recognized or the date at which the sales incentive is
  offered. We consider, among other things, the length of our largest ongoing customer relationships, duration of customer contracts,
  and the average life of vehicles on the road in determining the appropriate period of time over which to amortize these premiums.
  These core premiums are amortized over a period typically ranging from six to eight years, adjusted for specific circumstances
  associated with the arrangement. Core premiums are recorded as long-term contract assets. Core premiums expected to be
  amortized within our normal operating cycle, which is generally one year, are classified as short-term contract assets.

  Finished goods premiums paid to customers represent the difference between the finished good acquisition price paid to customers,
  generally in connection with new business, and the related finished good cost, which is treated as an asset and recognized as a
  reduction of revenue through the later of the date at which related revenue is recognized or the date at which the sales incentive is
  offered. We consider, among other things, the length of our largest ongoing customer relationships, duration of customer contracts,
  and the average life of vehicles on the road in determining the appropriate period of time over which to amortize these premiums.
  Finished goods premiums are amortized over a period typically ranging from six to eight years, adjusted for specific circumstances
  associated with the arrangement. Finished goods premiums are recorded as long-term contract assets. Finished goods premiums
  expected to be amortized within our normal operating cycle, which is generally one year, are classified as short-term contract
  assets.

  Long-term core inventory deposits represent the cost of Remanufactured Cores we have purchased from customers, which are held
  by the customers and remain on the customers’ premises. The costs of these Remanufactured Cores were established at the time of
  the transaction based on the then current cost. The selling value of these Remanufactured Cores was established based on agreed
  upon amounts with these customers. We expect to realize the selling value and the related cost of these Remanufactured Cores
  should our relationship with a customer end, a possibility that we consider remote based on existing long-term customer
  agreements and historical experience.

  Revenue Recognition

  Revenue is recognized when performance obligations under the terms of a contract with our customers are satisfied; generally, this
  occurs with the transfer of control of our products. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration we expect to receive in
  exchange for transferring goods or providing services. Revenue is recognized net of all anticipated returns, marketing allowances,
  volume discounts, and other forms of variable consideration. Revenue is recognized either when products are shipped or when
  delivered, depending on the applicable contract terms.

  The price of a finished remanufactured product sold to customers is generally comprised of separately invoiced amounts for the
  Remanufactured Core included in the product (“Remanufactured Core value”) and the unit portion included in the product (“Unit
  Value”), for which revenue is recorded based on our then current price list, net of applicable discounts and allowances. The
  Remanufactured Core value is recorded as a net revenue based upon the estimate of Used Cores that will not be returned by the
  customer for credit. These estimates are subjective and based on management’s judgment and knowledge of historical, current, and
  projected return rates. As reconciliations are completed with the customers the actual rates at which Used Cores are not being
  returned may differ from the current estimates. This may result in periodic adjustments of the estimated contract asset and liability
  amounts recorded and may impact the projected revenue recognition rates used to record the estimated future revenue. These
  estimates may also be revised if there are changes in contractual arrangements with customers, or changes in business practices. A
  significant portion of the remanufactured automotive parts sold to customers are replaced by similar Used Cores sent back for
  credit by customers under the core exchange programs (as described in further detail below). The number of Used Cores sent back
  under the core exchange programs is generally limited to the number of similar Remanufactured Cores previously shipped to each
  customer.


                                                                   29

  Revenue Recognition — Core Exchange Programs

  Full price Remanufactured Cores: When remanufactured products are shipped, certain customers are invoiced for the
  Remanufactured Core value of the product at the full Remanufactured Core sales price. For these Remanufactured Cores, revenue
  is only recognized based upon an estimate of the rate at which these customers will pay cash for Remanufactured Cores in lieu of
  sending back similar Used Cores for credits under the core exchange programs. The remainder of the full price Remanufactured
  Core value invoiced to these customers is established as a long-term contract liability rather than being recognized as revenue in
  the period the products are shipped as we expect these Remanufactured Cores to be returned for credit under our core exchange
  programs.

  Nominal price Remanufactured Cores: Certain other customers are invoiced for the Remanufactured Core value of the product
  shipped at a nominal (generally $0.01 or less) Remanufactured Core price. For these nominal Remanufactured Cores, revenue is
  only recognized based upon an estimate of the rate at which these customers will pay cash for Remanufactured Cores in lieu of
  sending back similar Used Cores for credits under the core exchange programs. Revenue amounts are calculated based on
  contractually agreed upon pricing for these Remanufactured Cores for which the customers are not returning similar Used Cores.
  The remainder of the nominal price Remanufactured Core value invoiced to these customers is established as a long-term contract
  liability rather than being recognized as revenue in the period the products are shipped as we expect these Remanufactured Cores
  to be returned for credit under our core exchange programs.

  Revenue Recognition; General Right of Return

  Customers are allowed to return goods that their end-user customers have returned to them, whether or not the returned item is
  defective (warranty returns). In addition, under the terms of certain agreements and industry practice, customers from time to time
  are allowed stock adjustments when their inventory of certain product lines exceeds the anticipated sales to end-user customers
  (stock adjustment returns). Customers have various contractual rights for stock adjustment returns, which are typically less than
  5% of units sold. In some instances, a higher level of returns is allowed in connection with significant restocking orders. The
  aggregate returns are generally limited to less than 20% of unit sales.

  The allowance for warranty returns is established based on a historical analysis of the level of this type of return as a percentage of
  total unit sales. The allowance for stock adjustment returns is based on specific customer inventory levels, inventory movements,
  and information on the estimated timing of stock adjustment returns provided by customers. Stock adjustment returns do not occur
  at any specific time during the year. The return rate for stock adjustments is calculated based on expected returns within the normal
  operating cycle, which is generally one year.

  The Unit Value of the warranty and stock adjustment returns are treated as reductions of revenue based on the estimations made at
  the time of the sale. The Remanufactured Core value of warranty and stock adjustment returns are provided for as indicated in the
  paragraph “Revenue Recognition – Core Exchange Programs”.

  As is standard in the industry, we only accept returns from on-going customers. If a customer ceases doing business with us, we
  have no further obligation to accept additional product returns from that customer. Similarly, we accept product returns and grant
  appropriate credits to new customers from the time the new customer relationship is established.

  Contract Liability

  Contract liability consists of: (i) customer allowances earned, (ii) accrued core payments, (iii) customer core returns accruals, (iv)
  core bank liability, (v) finished goods liabilities, and (vi) customer deposits.

  Customer allowances earned includes all marketing allowances provided to customers. Such allowances include sales incentives
  and concessions. Voluntary marketing allowances related to a single exchange of product are recorded as a reduction of revenues at
  the time the related revenues are recorded or when such incentives are offered. Other marketing allowances, which may only be
  applied against future purchases, are recorded as a reduction to revenues in accordance with a schedule set forth in the relevant
  contract. Sales incentive amounts are recorded based on the value of the incentive provided. Customer allowances to be provided
  to customers within our normal operating cycle, which is generally one year, are considered short-term contract liabilities and the
  remainder are recorded as long-term contract liabilities.

  Accrued core payments represent the sales price of Remanufactured Cores purchased from customers, generally in connection with
  new business, which are held by these customers and remain on their premises. The sales price of these Remanufactured Cores will
  be realized when our relationship with a customer ends, a possibility that we consider remote based on existing long-term customer
  agreements and historical experience. The payments to be made to customers for purchases of Remanufactured Cores within our
  normal operating cycle, which is generally one year, are considered short-term contract liabilities and the remainder are recorded
  as long-term contract liabilities.

  Customer core returns accruals represent the full and nominally priced Remanufactured Cores shipped to our customers. When we
  ship product, we recognize an obligation to accept a similar Used Core sent back under the core exchange programs based upon
  the Remanufactured Core price agreed upon by us and our customer. The contract liability related to Used Cores returned by
  consumers to our customers but not yet returned to us are classified as short-term contract liabilities until we physically receive
  these Used Cores as they are expected to be returned during our normal operating cycle, which is generally one year and the
  remainder are recorded as long-term contract liabilities.

  The core bank liability represents the full Remanufactured Core sales price for cores returned under our core exchange programs.
  The payment for these returned cores are made over a contractual repayment period pursuant to our agreement with this customer.
  Payments to be made within our normal operating cycle, which is generally one year, are considered short-term contract liabilities
  and the remainder are recorded as long-term contract liabilities.

  Finished goods liabilities represents the agreed upon price of finished goods acquired from customers, generally in connection with
  new business. The payment for these finished goods are made over a contractual repayment period pursuant to our agreement with
  the customer. Payments to be made within our normal operating cycle, which is generally one year, are considered short-term
  contract liabilities and the remainder are recorded as long-term contract liabilities.

  Customer deposits represent the receipt of prepayments from customers for the obligation to transfer goods or services in the
  future. We classify these customer deposits as short-term contract liabilities as we expect to satisfy these obligations within our
  normal operating cycle, which generally one year.

  Customer Finished Goods Returns Accrual

  The customer finished goods returns accrual represents our estimate of our exposure to customer returns, including warranty
  returns, under our general right of return policy to allow customers to return items that their end user customers have returned to
  them and from time to time, stock adjustment returns when the customers’ inventory of certain product lines exceeds the
  anticipated sales to end-user customers. The customer finished goods returns accrual represents the Unit Value of the estimated
  returns and is classified as a current liability due to the expectation that these returns will occur within the normal operating cycle
  of one year. Our customer finished goods returns accrual was $38,086,000 and $31,524,000 at March 31, 2022 and 2021,
  respectively. The increase in the customer finished goods returns accrual primarily resulted from the timing of returned goods
  authorizations (“RGAs”) issued at March 31, 2022 compared with March 31, 2021.

  Income Taxes

  We account for income taxes using the liability method, which measures deferred income taxes by applying enacted statutory rates
  in effect at the balance sheet date to the differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the
  financial statements. The resulting asset or liability is adjusted to reflect changes in the tax laws as they occur. A valuation
  allowance is provided to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax asset will not
  be realized.


                                                                     31

  Realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income. Significant judgment
  is required in determining our provision for income taxes, our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance
  recorded against our net deferred tax assets. We make these estimates and judgments about our future taxable income that are
  based on assumptions that are consistent with our future plans. A valuation allowance is established when we believe it is not more
  likely than not all or some of a deferred tax assets will be realized. In evaluating our ability to recover deferred tax assets within
  the jurisdiction in which they arise, we consider all available positive and negative evidence. Deferred tax assets arising primarily
  as a result of net operating loss carry-forwards and research and development credits in connection with our Canadian operations
  have been offset completely by a valuation allowance due to the uncertainty of their utilization in future periods. Should the actual
  amount differ from our estimate, the amount of our valuation allowance could be impacted.

  We have made an accounting policy election to recognize the U.S. tax effects of global intangible low-taxed income as a
  component of income tax expense in the period the tax arises.

  Results of Operations

  The following discussion and analysis should be read together with the financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere
  herein.

  The following summarizes certain key operating data for the periods indicated:

                                                                                               Fiscal Years Ended March 31,
                                                                                             2022           2021        2020

  Cash flows (used in) provided by operations                                            $(44,862,000) $ 56,089,000      $ 18,795,000
  Finished goods turnover (1)                                                                      3.8           4.1               4.1

  (1) Finished goods turnover is calculated by dividing the cost of goods sold for the year by the average between beginning and
      ending non-core finished goods inventory values, for each fiscal year. We believe that this provides a useful measure of our
      ability to turn our inventory into revenues. The decrease in finished goods turnover for fiscal 2022 reflects our continued
      investment in inventory to address disruptions related to the worldwide supply chain and logistics challenges to meet higher
      anticipated future sales.

  Fiscal 2022 Compared with Fiscal 2021

  Net Sales and Gross Profit

  The following summarizes net sales and gross profit:

                                                                                                        Fiscal Years Ended March

  Net sales                                                                                           $650,308,000 $540,782,000
  Cost of goods sold                                                                                   532,443,000  431,321,000
  Gross profit                                                                                         117,865,000  109,461,000
  Gross profit percentage                                                                                     18.1%        20.2%

  Net Sales. Our net sales for fiscal 2022 were $650,308,000, which represents an increase of $109,526,000, or 20.3%, from fiscal
  2021 of $540,782,000. While our net sales increased across all product lines due to strong demand for our products, we continued
  to experience a number of challenges related to the global COVID-19 pandemic, including disruptions with worldwide supply
  chain and logistics services during both periods. Net sales for fiscal 2022 and 2021 include $13,327,000 and $12,779,000,
  respectively, in core revenue due to a realignment of inventory at certain customer distribution centers. We expect this realignment
  will benefit our future sales as product mix changes.

  Gross Profit. Our gross profit increased $8,404,000, or 7.7%, to $117,865,000 for fiscal 2022 from $109,461,000 for fiscal 2021.
  Our gross profit increased due to strong demand across all product lines.

  Our gross margin was 18.1% of net sales for fiscal 2022 compared with 20.2% of net sales for fiscal 2021. The decrease in our
  gross margin was primarily due to inflationary costs related to the global pandemic, including disruptions with worldwide supply
  chain, logistics services, and related higher freight costs. During fiscal 2022 and 2021, higher freight costs, net of certain price
  increases that went into effect during the latter part of the current year, impacted gross margin by approximately $9,135,000, and
  $1,785,000, respectively. During fiscal 2022, we also incurred additional expenses of $8,759,000 due to COVID-19 related costs
  for disruptions in the supply chain, increased salaries associated with COVID-19 vulnerable employee pay, and personal protective
  equipment. During fiscal 2021, we incurred additional expenses of $5,268,000 due to increased salaries associated with COVID-19
  bonuses, vulnerable employee pay, and personal protective equipment in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic.

  Our gross margin for fiscal 2022 and 2021 was also impacted by (i) transition expenses in connection with the expansion of our
  brake-related operations in Mexico of $2,744,000 and $16,353,000, respectively, and (ii) amortization of core and finished goods
  premiums paid to customers related to new business of $11,960,000 and $6,691,000, respectively. Expansion of our brake-related
  operations in Mexico was completed during the second quarter of fiscal 2022.

  In addition, gross margin was impacted by (i) non-cash quarterly revaluation of cores that are part of the finished goods on the
  customers’ shelves (which are included in contract assets) to the lower of cost or net realizable value and gain due to realignment
  of inventory at customer distribution centers, which resulted in a net gain of $75,000 and net write-down of $209,000 for fiscal
  2022 and 2021, respectively, (ii) customer allowances and return accruals related to new business of $307,000 recorded during
  fiscal 2021, (iii) net tariff costs of $332,000 not passed through to customers for fiscal 2021, and (iv) a $3,561,000 benefit for
  revised tariff costs recorded during fiscal 2021.

  General and Administrative. Our general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2022 were $57,499,000, which represents an
  increase of $3,652,000, or 6.8%, from fiscal 2021 of $53,847,000, however, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of
  net sales decreased to 8.8% for fiscal 2022 from 10.0% for the prior year. The increase in general and administrative expense was
  primarily due to (i) $2,040,000 of increased share-based compensation due to equity grants made to employees in fiscal 2022, (ii)
  $353,000 of increased employee related expenses, primarily due to the reinstatement of salary reductions in the prior year in
  response to the COVID-19 pandemic, (iii) $905,000 of decreased gain resulting from foreign currency transactions, (iv) $705,000
  of increased costs at our offshore locations, (vi) $305,000 of increased information technology costs in connection with
  cybersecurity and other productivity tools, and (vii) $292,000 of increased general insurance costs. These increases in general and
  administrative expenses were partially offset by $1,329,000 of decreased professional services.

  Sales and Marketing. Our sales and marketing expenses for fiscal 2022 were $22,833,000, which represents an increase of
  $4,809,000, or 26.7%, from fiscal 2021 of $18,024,000. This increase in sales and marketing expense during fiscal 2022 was
  primarily due to (i) $1,500,000 of increased commissions due to higher sales, (ii) $1,304,000 of increased employee related
  expenses, primarily due to the reinstatement of salary reductions in the prior year in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and
  increased headcount in the current year, (iii) $1,027,000 of increased marketing in connection with new business and advertising
  expense, (iv) $501,000 of increased travel as normal business operations resume, and (v) $261,000 of increased trade shows
  expense as normal business operations resume.

  Research and Development. Our research and development expenses for fiscal 2022 were $10,502,000, which represents an
  increase of $1,939,000, or 22.6%, from fiscal 2021 of $8,563,000. This increase in research and development expenses during
  fiscal 2022 was primarily due to (i) $1,274,000 of increased employee related expenses, primarily due to the reinstatement of
  salary reductions in the prior year in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and increased headcount during the current year, (ii)
  $504,000 of increased outside services primarily due to development projects, and (iii) $110,000 of increased samples for our core
  library and other research and development supplies.

  Foreign Exchange Impact of Lease Liabilities and Forward Contracts. Our foreign exchange impact of lease liabilities and
  forward contracts for fiscal 2022 was a non-cash gain of $1,673,000 compared with a non-cash gain for fiscal 2021 of
  $17,606,000. This change in gain was primarily due to (i) the remeasurement of our foreign currency-denominated lease liabilities
  which resulted in non-cash gains of $1,989,000 compared with $9,893,000 for fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively, due to foreign
  currency exchange rate fluctuations and (ii) the forward foreign currency exchange contracts which resulted in a non-cash loss of
  $316,000 compared with a non-cash gain of $7,713,000 for fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively, due to the changes in their fair
  values.

  Interest Expense

  Interest Expense, net. Our interest expense, net for fiscal 2022 was $15,555,000, which represents a decrease of $215,000, or 1.3%,
  from fiscal 2021 of $15,770,000. The decrease in interest expense was primarily due to lower interest rates on our accounts
  receivable discount programs partially offset by increased borrowing under our credit facility.

  Provision for Income Taxes

  Income Tax. We recorded income tax expense of $5,788,000, or an effective tax rate of 44.0%, for fiscal 2022 and $9,387,000, or
  an effective tax rate of 30.4%, for fiscal 2021. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2022 was primarily impacted by (i) non-deductible
  executive compensation under Internal Revenue Code Section 162(m), (ii) income taxes associated with uncertain tax positions,
  (iii) specific jurisdictions that we do not expect to recognize the benefit of losses, and (iv) foreign income taxed at rates that are
  different from the federal statutory rate.

  March 31, 2020, has been omitted from this Form 10-K but may be found in Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
  Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of the annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2021, filed with
  the SEC on June 14, 2021, which is available free of charge on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov by searching with our ticker

  Liquidity and Capital Resources

  Overview

  We had working capital (current assets minus current liabilities) of $110,580,000 and $96,725,000, a ratio of current assets to
  current liabilities of 1.3:1.0, at March 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The increase in working capital resulted from our
  investment in inventory to address disruptions related to the worldwide supply chain and logistics challenges to meet higher
  anticipated sales.

  We generated cash during fiscal 2022 from the use of receivable discount programs and credit facility. In addition, we have access
  to our existing cash, as well as our available credit facilities to meet short-term liquidity needs. We believe our cash and cash
  equivalents, short-term investments, use of receivable discount programs, amounts available under our credit facility, and other
  sources are sufficient to satisfy our expected future working capital needs, repayment of the current portion of our term loans, and
  lease and capital expenditure obligations over the next 12 months.


                                                                     35

  Fiscal 2022 Compared with Fiscal 2021

  Net cash used in operating activities was $44,862,000 for fiscal 2022 compared with net cash provided by operating activities of
  $56,089,000 for fiscal 2021. The significant change in our operating activities was due primarily to (i) increased sales for fiscal
  2022 compared with fiscal 2021, resulting in a higher accounts receivable balance which will be collected in future periods and (ii)
  higher inventory purchases during the current year compared with the prior year as we increased our inventory levels as a result of
  disruptions with worldwide supply chain and logistics services to meet higher anticipated sales, however, our days payable
  outstanding did not increase proportionately to our purchases during the current year as compared with the prior year. Our
  operating results (net income plus the net add-back for non-cash transactions in earnings) were higher during fiscal 2022 as
  compared with fiscal 2021.

  Net cash used in investing activities was $7,938,000 and $14,214,000 for fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively. The significant
  change in our investing activities was due primarily to decreased capital expenditures in connection with the completion of our
  expansion of our brake-related operations in Mexico during the second quarter of fiscal 2022.

  Net cash provided by financing activities was $60,215,000 for fiscal 2022 compared with net cash used in financing activities
  $76,567,000 for fiscal 2021. The significant change in our financing activities was due mainly to additional net borrowings under
  our credit facility during fiscal 2022 to support the investment in our inventory compared with repayments under our credit facility
  during fiscal 2021.

  Fiscal 2021 Compared with Fiscal 2020

  Capital Resources

  Debt

  We are party to a $268,620,000 senior secured financing, (as amended from time to time, the “Credit Facility”) with a syndicate of
  lenders, and PNC Bank, National Association, as administrative agent, consisting of (i) a $238,620,000 revolving loan facility,
  subject to borrowing base restrictions, a $24,000,000 sublimit for borrowings by Canadian borrowers, and a $20,000,000 sublimit
  for letters of credit (the “Revolving Facility”) and (ii) a $30,000,000 term loan facility (the “Term Loans”). The loans under the
  Credit Facility mature on June 5, 2023. The Credit Facility currently permits the payment of up to $29,430,000 of dividends and
  share repurchases for fiscal year 2022, subject to pro forma compliance with financial covenants. In connection with the Credit
  Facility, the lenders have a security interest in substantially all of our assets.


                                                                   36

  In May 2021, we entered into a third amendment to the Credit Facility (the “Third Amendment”). The Third Amendment, among
  other things, (i) extended the maturity date from June 5, 2023 to May 28, 2026, (ii) modified the fixed charge coverage ratio
  financial covenant, and (iii) modified the definition of “Consolidated EBITDA”. We capitalized $1,159,000 of new debt issuance
  costs in connection with the Third Amendment.

  The Term Loans require quarterly principal payments of $937,500. The Credit Facility bears interest at rates equal to either LIBOR
  plus a margin of 2.25%, 2.50% or 2.75% or a reference rate plus a margin of 1.25%, 1.50% or 1.75%, in each case depending on
  the senior leverage ratio as of the applicable measurement date. There is also a facility fee of 0.375% to 0.50%, depending on the
  senior leverage ratio as of the applicable measurement date. The interest rate on our Term Loans and Revolving Facility was 2.99%
  and 3.13%, respectively, at March 31, 2022, and 2.62% at March 31, 2021.

  The Credit Facility, among other things, requires us to maintain certain financial covenants including a maximum senior leverage
  ratio and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio. We were in compliance with all financial covenants as of March 31, 2022. Our
  Consolidated EBITDA for the purposes of bank covenant calculations was $62,540,000 for fiscal 2022.

  The following summarizes the financial covenants required under the Credit Facility:

                                                                                           Financial covenants
                                                                                         required per the Credit Calculation as of
                                                                                                Facility         March 31, 2022

  Maximum senior leverage ratio                                                                              3.00                 2.74
  Minimum fixed charge coverage ratio                                                                        1.10                 1.27

  We had cash of $23,016,000 at March 31, 2022, however, the Credit Facility only allows up to $6,000,000 of credit for cash when
  computing the senior leverage ratio. Our senior leverage ratio would have been 2.55 had we paid down the Revolving Facility with
  cash on hand. In addition to other covenants, the Credit Facility places limits on our ability to incur liens, incur additional
  indebtedness, make loans and investments, engage in mergers and acquisitions, engage in asset sales, redeem or repurchase capital
  stock, alter the business conducted by us and our subsidiaries, transact with affiliates, prepay, redeem or purchase subordinated
  debt, and amend or otherwise alter debt agreements.

  We had $155,000,000 and $84,000,000 outstanding under the Revolving Facility at March 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. In
  addition, $6,370,000 was reserved for letters of credit at March 31, 2022. At March 31, 2022, after certain adjustments,
  $77,250,000 was available under the Revolving Facility.

  Receivable Discount Programs

  We use receivable discount programs with certain customers and their respective banks. Under these programs, we have options to
  sell those customers’ receivables to those banks at a discount to be agreed upon at the time the receivables are sold. These discount
  arrangements allow us to accelerate receipt of payment on customers’ receivables. While these arrangements have reduced our
  working capital needs, there can be no assurance that these programs will continue in the future. Interest expense resulting from
  these programs would increase if interest rates rise, if utilization of these discounting arrangements expands, if customers extend
  their payment to us, or if the discount period is extended to reflect more favorable payment terms to customers.


                                                                   37

  Multi-year Customer Agreements

  We have or are renegotiating long-term agreements with many of our major customers. Under these agreements, which in most
  cases have initial terms of at least four years, we are designated as the exclusive or primary supplier for specified categories of our
  products. Because of the very competitive nature of the market and the limited number of customers for these products, our
  customers have sought and obtained price concessions, significant marketing allowances and more favorable delivery and payment
  terms in consideration for our designation as a customer’s exclusive or primary supplier. These incentives differ from contract to
  contract and can include (i) the issuance of a specified amount of credits against receivables in accordance with a schedule set forth
  in the relevant contract, (ii) support for a particular customer’s research or marketing efforts provided on a scheduled basis, (iii)
  discounts granted in connection with each individual shipment of product, and (iv) other marketing, research, store expansion or
  product development support. These contracts typically require that we meet ongoing performance standards.

  While these longer-term agreements strengthen our customer relationships, the increased demand for our products often requires
  that we increase our inventories and personnel. Customer demands that we purchase their Remanufactured Core inventory also
  require the use of our working capital. The marketing and other allowances we typically grant our customers in connection with
  our new or expanded customer relationships adversely impact the near-term revenues, profitability and associated cash flows from
  these arrangements. However, we believe the investment we make in these new or expanded customer relationships will improve
  our overall liquidity and cash flow from operations over time.

  Share Repurchase Program

  In August 2018, our board of directors approved an increase in our share repurchase program from $20,000,000 to $37,000,000 of
  our common stock. During fiscal 2022 and 2021, we repurchased 106,486 and 54,960 shares of our common stock, respectively,
  for $1,914,000 and $1,139,000, respectively. During fiscal 2020, we did not repurchase any shares of our common stock. As of
  March 31, 2022, $18,745,000 was utilized and $18,255,000 remains available to repurchase shares under the authorized share
  repurchase program, subject to the limit in our Credit Facility. We retired the 837,007 shares repurchased under this program
  through March 31, 2022. Our share repurchase program does not obligate us to acquire any specific number of shares and shares
  may be repurchased in privately negotiated and/or open market transactions.

  Capital Expenditures and Commitments

  Our total capital expenditures, including capital leases and non-cash capital expenditures, were $8,150,000 for fiscal 2022 and
  $16,806,000 for fiscal 2021. These capital expenditures primarily include the purchase of equipment for our current operations and
  the expansion of our operations in Mexico, which was completed during the second quarter of fiscal 2022. We expect to incur
  approximately $10,000,000 of capital expenditures primarily to support our current operations during fiscal 2023. We have used
  and expect to continue using our working capital and additional capital lease obligations to finance these capital expenditures.

  (1) Finance lease obligations represent amounts due under finance leases for various types of equipment.

  (2) Operating lease obligations represent amounts due for rent under our leases for all our facilities, certain equipment, and our
      Company automobile.

  (3) Obligations under our Revolving Facility mature on May 28, 2026. This debt is classified as a short term liability on our
      balance sheet as we expect to use our working capital to repay the amounts outstanding under our revolving loan.

  (4) Term Loan obligations represent the amounts due for principal payments as well as interest payments to be made. Interest
      payments were calculated based upon the interest rate for our Term Loan using the LIBOR option at March 31, 2022, which
      was 2.99%.

  (5) Accrued core payment represents the amounts due for principal of $2,607,000 and interest payments of $106,000 to be made in
      connection with the purchases of Remanufactured Cores from our customers, which are held by these customers and remain on
      their premises.

  (6) The core bank liability represents the amounts due for principal of $16,901,000 and interest payments of $1,264,000 to be
      made in connection with the return of Used Cores from our customers.

  (7) Finished goods liabilities represents the amounts due for principal of $3,125,000 and interest payments of $64,000 to be made
      in connection with the purchase of finished goods from our customers.

  (8) We are unable to reliably estimate the timing of future payments related to uncertain tax position liabilities at March 31, 2022;
      therefore, future tax payment accruals related to uncertain tax positions in the amount of $1,975,000 have been excluded from
      the table above.

  (9) Other long-term obligations represent commitments we have with certain customers to provide marketing allowances in
      consideration for multi-year customer agreements to provide products over a defined period. We are not obligated to provide
      these marketing allowances should our business relationships end with these customers.

  Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

  Our primary market risk relates to changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, and customer credit. We do not enter
  into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. As our overseas operations expand, our exposure
  to the risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations will continue to increase.

  Interest rate risk

  We are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily as a result of our borrowing and receivable discount programs, which have
  interest costs that vary with interest rate movements. Our credit facility bears interest at variable base rates, plus an applicable
  margin. At March 31, 2022, our net debt obligations totaled $171,694,000. If interest rates were to increase 1%, our net annual
  interest expense would have increased by approximately $1,717,000. In addition, for each $10,000,000 of accounts receivable we
  discount over a period of 180 days, a 1% increase in interest rates would increase our interest expense by $50,000.

  Foreign currency risk

  We are exposed to foreign currency exchange risk inherent in our anticipated purchases and expenses denominated in currencies
  other than the U.S. dollar. We transact business in the following foreign currencies; Mexican pesos, Malaysian ringgit, Singapore
  dollar, Chinese yuan, and the Canadian dollar. Our primary currency risks result from fluctuations in the value of the Mexican peso
  and to a lesser extent the Chinese yuan. To mitigate these risks, we enter into forward foreign currency exchange contracts to
  exchange U.S. dollars for these foreign currencies. The extent to which we use forward foreign currency exchange contracts is
  periodically reviewed in light of our estimate of market conditions and the terms and length of anticipated requirements. The use of
  derivative financial instruments allows us to reduce our exposure to the risk that the eventual net cash outflow resulting from
  funding the expenses of the foreign operations will be materially affected by changes in exchange rates. These contracts generally
  expire in a year or less. Any changes in the fair values of our forward foreign currency exchange contracts are reflected in current
  period earnings. Based upon our forward foreign currency exchange contracts related to these currencies, an increase of 10% in
  exchange rates at March 31, 2022 would have increased our operating expenses by approximately $4,189,000. During fiscal 2022
  and fiscal 2021, a loss of $316,000 and a gain of $7,713,000, respectively, was recorded due to the change in the value of the
  forward foreign currency exchange contracts subsequent to entering into the contracts. In addition, we recorded gains $1,989,000
  and $9,893,000 in connection with the remeasurement of foreign currency-denominated lease liabilities during fiscal 2022 and
  fiscal 2021, respectively.

  Credit Risk

  We regularly review our accounts receivable and allowance for credit losses by considering factors such as historical experience,
  credit quality and age of the accounts receivable, and the current economic conditions that may affect a customer’s ability to pay
  such amounts owed to us. The majority of our sales are to leading automotive aftermarket parts suppliers. We believe the credit
  risk with respect to trade accounts receivable is limited due to our credit evaluation process and the nature of our customers.
  However, should our customers experience significant cash flow problems, our financial position and results of operations could be
  materially and adversely affected, and the maximum amount of loss that would be incurred would be the outstanding receivable
  balance, Used Cores expected to be returned by customers, and the value of the Remanufactured Cores held at customers’
  locations. We maintain an allowance for credit losses that, in our opinion, provides for an adequate reserve to cover losses that may
  be incurred.

  Item 9A. Controls and Procedures

  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

  Management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”), Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”) and Chief
  Accounting Officer (“CAO”), has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-
  15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the “Exchange Act,”) as of the end of the period
  covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

  Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose
  in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our CEO,
  CFO and CAO, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures, and is recorded, processed, summarized,
  and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Based on this evaluation, our CEO, CFO and CAO
  have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of March 31, 2022.

  Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

  Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rules
  13a-15(f) and 15d- 15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide
  reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of our financial statements for external
  purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

  Management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2022 using the criteria set
  forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control—Integrated Framework
  (2013). Based on its assessment, our management, including our CEO and CFO, has concluded that our internal control over
  financial reporting was effective as of March 31, 2022.

  The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2022 has been audited by the Company’s
  independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP. Their assessment is included in the accompanying Report of
  Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.

  Change in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

  There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the
  Exchange Act) identified in connection with the evaluation of our internal control performed during the period covered by this
  report, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

  Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls

  Management recognizes that a control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not
  absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact
  that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent
  limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of
  fraud or error, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be
  faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake.

  Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by
  management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the
  likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all
  potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of
  compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system,
  misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.

                          REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

  To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Motorcar Parts of America, Inc.

  Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

  We have audited Motorcar Parts of America, Inc. and subsidiaries’ internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2022,
  based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of
  the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Motorcar Parts of America, Inc. and subsidiaries
  (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2022, based
  on the COSO criteria.

  We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)
  (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of March 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of
  operations, comprehensive income (loss), shareholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
  March 31, 2022, and the related notes and financial statement schedule and our report dated June 14, 2022 expressed an
  unqualified opinion thereon.

  Basis for Opinion

  The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its
  assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on
  Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over
  financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be
  independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and
  regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

  We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the
  audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
  respects.

  Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material
  weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and
  performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
  basis for our opinion.

  Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

  A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
  reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally
  accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that
  (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of
  the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
  financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
  company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
  reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s
  assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

  Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,
  projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because
  of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

                                                                      /s/ Ernst & Young LLP

                         REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

  To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Motorcar Parts of America, Inc.

  Opinion on the Financial Statements

  We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Motorcar Parts of America, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company)
  as of March 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), shareholders’
  equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended March 31, 2022, and the related notes and financial statement
  schedule listed in the Index at Item 15 (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the
  consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at March 31, 2022
  and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended March 31, 2022, in
  conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

  We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)
  (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal
  Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013
  framework), and our report dated June 14, 2022 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

  Basis for Opinion

  These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the
  Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required
  to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and
  regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

  We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the
  audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error
  or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements,
  whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a
  test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the
  accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the
  financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

  Critical Audit Matters

  The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that
  were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are
  material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The
  communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a
  whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters
  or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.

                                    Contractual Agreements with Core Exchange Programs

  Description of the matter         As more fully described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company enters
                                    into contractual arrangements with customers (core exchange programs) which represent the

                                    programs included, among others, (i) reviewing agreements and amendments for significant
                                    customers, (ii) testing the completeness of management’s identification of contractual terms, (iii)

                                    Marketing Allowances

  Description of the matter         As more fully described in Note 2 and Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements, revenue
                                    is recognized net of applicable marketing allowances. These marketing allowances vary by
                                    contract and can include (i) the issuance of a specified amount of credits against receivables, (ii)
                                    support for research or marketing efforts, (iii) discounts granted in connection with shipments of
                                    product, and (iv) other marketing, research, store expansion or product development support. At
                                    March 31, 2022, marketing allowances recorded on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet
                                    was $22,059,000, which is presented within contract liabilities.

                                    Auditing the completeness of marketing allowances was complex because marketing allowances
                                    vary by contract and could be impacted by unrecorded marketing allowances provided to
                                    customers.

  How we addressed the              We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of
  matter in our audit               controls over the marketing allowances processes. For example, we tested controls over
                                    management’s review of contracts with customers containing marketing allowances,
                                    management’s review of the completeness and accuracy of data used in the marketing accrual
                                    analysis at period end and management’s review of credits issued to customers subsequent to the
                                    balance sheet date.

                                    Our audit procedures to test marketing allowances included, among others, reviewing significant
                                    contracts with customers, obtaining confirmations of contractual terms and conditions from a
                                    sample of the Company’s customers, and testing credits issued or payments made to customers
                                    throughout the year. We tested the completeness and accuracy of data used in the calculation of
                                    the marketing allowance by agreeing contractual terms to the underlying agreements. In
                                    addition, we evaluated the relationship between revenue and marketing allowances and assessed
                                    subsequent events to determine whether there was any new information that would require
                                    adjustments to the amounts recorded.

                                                                    /s/ Ernst & Young LLP

  We have served as the Company’s auditor since 2007.

                                  MOTORCAR PARTS OF AMERICA, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
                                        Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

  1. Company Background and Organization

  Motorcar Parts of America, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the “Company”, or “MPA”) is a leading supplier of automotive aftermarket
  non-discretionary replacement parts, and test solutions and diagnostic equipment. These replacement parts are primarily sold to
  automotive retail chain stores and warehouse distributors throughout North America and to major automobile manufacturers for
  both their aftermarket programs and warranty replacement programs (“OES”). The Company’s test solutions and diagnostic
  equipment primarily serves the global automotive component and powertrain testing market. The Company’s products include (i)
  rotating electrical products such as alternators and starters, (ii) wheel hub assemblies and bearings, (iii) brake-related products,
  which include brake calipers, brake boosters, brake rotors, brake pads, and brake master cylinders, and (iv) other products, which
  include (a) turbochargers and (b) test solutions and diagnostic equipment used for electric vehicle powertrain development and
  manufacturing including electric motor test systems, e-axle test systems, advanced power emulators, charging unit test systems,
  test systems for alternators and starters, belt starter generators, bench-top testers, and specialized test services for electric vehicle
  inverters.

  The Company primarily ships its products from its facilities, including the Company’s 410,000 square foot distribution center in
  Tijuana, Mexico, and various third-party warehouse distribution centers in North America.

  Impact of the Novel Coronavirus (“COVID-19”)

  The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic continues to adversely impact the U.S. and global economies – creating uncertainty
  regarding the potential effects on the Company’s employees, supply chain, operations, and customer demand. The COVID-19
  pandemic could impact the Company’s operations and the operations of its customers, suppliers, and vendors because of
  quarantines, facility closures, travel, and logistics restrictions. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts the Company
  will depend on numerous factors and future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including, but not
  limited to: (i) the severity of the virus, (ii) the occurrence and duration of additional spikes in infections, (iii) the effects of the
  pandemic on customers, suppliers, and vendors, (iv) the remedial actions and stimulus measures adopted by local, state and federal
  governments, (v) the availability and acceptance of vaccines, and (vi) the extent to which normal economic and operating
  conditions can resume. Even after the COVID-19 pandemic has subsided, the Company may continue to experience adverse
  impacts to its business because of an economic recession or depression that has occurred or may occur in the future.

  2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

  Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements

  Income Taxes

  In December 2019, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued guidance that simplifies the accounting for income
  taxes, eliminates certain exceptions within Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 740, Income Taxes, and clarifies certain
  aspects of the current guidance to promote consistent application. This guidance is effective for annual and interim periods in fiscal
  years beginning after December 15, 2020. The adoption of this guidance on April 1, 2021 did not have any material impact on the
  Company’s consolidated financial statements.

  Reclassifications

  Certain reclassifications have been made to the presentation of the prior year consolidated financial statements to conform to the
  current year presentation.


                                                                      F-6

  Principles of Consolidation

  The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Motorcar Parts of America, Inc. and its wholly owned
  subsidiaries. All significant inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated.

  Segment Reporting

  Pursuant to the guidance provided under the FASB ASC for segment reporting, the Company has identified its chief operating
  decision maker (“CODM”), reviewed the documents used by the CODM, and understands how such documents are used by the
  CODM to make financial and operating decisions. The Company has determined through this review process that its business
  comprises three separate operating segments. All of the operating segments meet all the aggregation criteria and are aggregated.

  Cash and Cash Equivalents

  Cash primarily consists of cash on hand and bank deposits. Cash equivalents consist of money market funds. The Company
  considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an original or remaining maturity of less than three months at the date of
  purchase to be cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents are maintained with various financial institutions.

  Accounts Receivable

  The Company’s accounts receivable are recorded at amortized cost less an allowance for credit losses that are not expected to be
  recovered. The net amount of accounts receivable and corresponding allowance for credit losses are presented in the consolidated
  balance sheets. The Company maintains allowances for credit losses resulting from the expected failure or inability of its
  customers to make required payments. The Company does not require collateral for accounts receivable. The Company believes its
  credit risk with respect to trade accounts receivable is limited due to its credit evaluation process and the long-term nature of its
  relationships with its largest customers. The Company utilizes a historical loss rate method, adjusted for any changes in economic
  conditions or risk characteristics, to estimate its expected credit losses each period. When developing an estimate of expected
  credit losses, the Company considers all available relevant information regarding the collectability of cash flows, including
  historical information, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions over the
  contractual life of the receivable. The historical loss rate method considers past write-offs of trade accounts receivable over a
  period commensurate with the initial term of the Company’s contracts with its customers. The Company recognizes the allowance
  for credit losses at inception and reassesses quarterly based on management’s expectation of the asset’s collectability. The
  Company’s accounts receivable are short-term in nature and written off only when all collection attempts have failed.

  The Company has receivable discount programs that have been established with certain major customers and their respective
  banks. Under these programs, the Company has the option to sell those customers’ receivables to those banks at a discount to be
  agreed upon at the time the receivables are sold. Once the customer chooses which outstanding invoices are going to be made
  available for discounting, the Company can accept or decline the bundle of invoices provided. The receivable discount programs
  are non-recourse, and funds cannot be reclaimed by the customer or its bank after the related invoices have been discounted.

  Inventory

  Inventory is comprised of: (i) Used Core and component raw materials, (ii) work-in-process, (iii) remanufactured finished goods
  and purchased finished goods.

  Used Core, component raw materials, and purchased finished goods are stated at the lower of average cost or net realizable value.

  Work-in-process is in various stages of production and is valued at the average cost of Used Cores and component raw materials
  issued to work orders still open, including allocations of labor and overhead costs. Historically, work-in-process inventory has not
  been material compared to the total inventory balance.

  Remanufactured finished goods include: (i) the Used Core cost and (ii) the cost of component raw materials, and allocations of
  labor and variable and fixed overhead costs (the “Unit Cost”). The allocations of labor and variable and fixed overhead costs are
  based on the actual use of the production facilities over the prior 12 months which approximates normal capacity. This method
  prevents the distortion in allocated labor and overhead costs that would occur during short periods of abnormally low or high
  production. In addition, the Company excludes certain unallocated overhead such as severance costs, duplicative facility overhead
  costs, start-up costs, training, and spoilage from the calculation and expenses these unallocated overhead costs as period costs.
  Purchased finished goods also include an allocation of fixed overhead costs.

  The estimate of net realizable value is subjective and based on management’s judgment and knowledge of current industry demand
  and management’s projections of industry demand. The estimates may, therefore, be revised if there are changes in the overall
  market for the Company’s products or market changes that in management’s judgment impact its ability to sell or liquidate
  potentially excess or obsolete inventory. Net realizable value is determined at least quarterly as follows:

       •    Net realizable value for finished goods by customer, by product line are determined based on the agreed upon selling
            price with the customer for a product in the trailing 12 months. The Company compares the average selling price,
            including any discounts and allowances, to the finished goods cost of on-hand inventory, less any reserve for excess and
            obsolete inventory. Any reduction of value is recorded as cost of goods sold in the period in which the revaluation is
            identified.

       •    Net realizable value for Used Cores are determined based on current core purchase prices from core brokers to the extent
            that core purchases in the trailing 12 months are significant. Remanufacturing consumes, on average, more than one Used
            Core for each remanufactured unit produced since not all Used Cores are reusable. The yield rates depend upon both the
            product and consumer specifications. The Company purchases Used Cores from core brokers to supplement its yield rates
            and Used Cores not returned under the core exchange programs. The Company also considers the net selling price its
            customers have agreed to pay for Used Cores that are not returned under its core exchange programs to assess whether
            Used Core cost exceeds Used Core net realizable value on a by customer, by product line basis. Any reduction of core
            cost is recorded as cost of goods sold in the period in which the revaluation is identified.

       •    The Company records an allowance for potentially excess and obsolete inventory based upon recent sales history, the
            quantity of inventory on-hand, and a forecast of potential use of the inventory. The Company periodically reviews
            inventory to identify excess quantities and part numbers that are experiencing a reduction in demand. Any part numbers
            with quantities identified during this process are reserved for at rates based upon management’s judgment, historical rates,
            and consideration of possible scrap and liquidation values which may be as high as 100% of cost if no liquidation market
            exists for the part. As a result of this process, the Company recorded reserves for excess and obsolete inventory of
            $13,520,000 and $13,246,000 at March 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

  The Company records vendor discounts as a reduction of inventories and are recognized as a reduction to cost of sales as the
  inventories are sold.

  Inventory Unreturned

  Inventory unreturned represents the Company’s estimate, based on historical data and prospective information provided directly by
  the customer, of finished goods shipped to customers that the Company expects to be returned under its general right of return
  policy, after the balance sheet date. Inventory unreturned includes only the Unit Cost of a finished good. The return rate is
  calculated based on expected returns within the normal operating cycle, which is generally one year. As such, the related amounts
  are classified in current assets. Inventory unreturned is valued in the same manner as the Company’s finished goods inventory.


                                                                    F-8

  Contract Assets

  Contract assets consists of: (i) the core portion of the finished goods shipped to customers, (ii) upfront payments to customers in
  connection with customer contracts, (iii) core premiums paid to customers, (iv) finished goods premiums paid to customers, and
  (v) long-term core inventory deposits.

  Remanufactured Cores held at customers’ locations as a part of the finished goods sold to the customer are classified as long-term
  contract assets. These assets are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value of Used Cores on hand (See Inventory above).
  For these Remanufactured Cores, the Company expects the finished good containing the Remanufactured Core to be returned
  under the Company’s general right of return policy or a similar Used Core to be returned to the Company by the customer, under
  the Company’s core exchange programs, in each case for credit. The Remanufactured Cores and Used Cores returned by
  consumers to the Company’s customers but not yet returned to the Company are classified as “Cores expected to be returned by
  customers”, which are included in short-term contract assets until the Company physically receives them during its normal
  operating cycle, which is generally one year.

  Upfront payments to customers represent the marketing allowances, such as sign-on bonuses, slotting fees, and promotional
  allowances provided by the Company to its customers. These allowances are recognized as an asset and amortized over the
  appropriate period of time as a reduction of revenue if the Company expects to generate future revenues associated with the
  upfront payment. If the Company does not expect to generate additional revenue, then the upfront payment is recognized in the
  consolidated statements of operations when payment occurs as a reduction of revenue. Upfront payments expected to be amortized
  during the Company’s normal operating cycle, which is generally one year, are classified as short-term contract assets.

  Core premiums paid to customers represent the difference between the Remanufactured Core acquisition price paid to customers,
  generally in connection with new business, and the related Used Core cost, which is treated as an asset and recognized as a
  reduction of revenue through the later of the date at which related revenue is recognized or the date at which the sales incentive is
  offered. The Company considers, among other things, the length of its largest ongoing customer relationships, duration of customer
  contracts, and the average life of vehicles on the road in determining the appropriate period of time over which to amortize these
  premiums. These core premiums are amortized over a period typically ranging from six to eight years, adjusted for specific
  circumstances associated with the arrangement. Core premiums are recorded as long-term contract assets. Core premiums expected
  to be amortized within the Company’s normal operating cycle, which is generally one year, are classified as short-term contract
  assets.

  Finished goods premiums paid to customers represent the difference between the finished good acquisition price paid to customers,
  generally in connection with new business, and the related finished good cost, which is treated as an asset and recognized as a
  reduction of revenue through the later of the date at which related revenue is recognized or the date at which the sales incentive is
  offered. The Company considers, among other things, the length of its largest ongoing customer relationships, duration of customer
  contracts, and the average life of vehicles on the road in determining the appropriate period of time over which to amortize these
  premiums. Finished goods premiums are amortized over a period typically ranging from six to eight years, adjusted for specific
  circumstances associated with the arrangement. Finished goods premiums are recorded as long-term contract assets. Finished
  goods premiums expected to be amortized within our normal operating cycle, which is generally one year, are classified as short-
  term contract assets.

  Long-term core inventory deposits represent the cost of Remanufactured Cores the Company has purchased from customers, which
  are held by the customers and remain on the customers’ premises. The costs of these Remanufactured Cores were established at the
  time of the transaction based on the then current cost. The selling value of these Remanufactured Cores was established based on
  agreed upon amounts with these customers. The Company expects to realize the selling value and the related cost of these
  Remanufactured Cores should its relationship with a customer end, a possibility that the Company considers remote based on
  existing long-term customer agreements and historical experience.


                                                                   F-9

  Customer Finished Goods Returns Accrual

  The customer finished goods returns accrual represents the Company’s estimate of its exposure to customer returns, including
  warranty returns, under its general right of return policy to allow customers to return items that their end user customers have
  returned to them and from time to time, stock adjustment returns when the customers’ inventory of certain product lines exceeds
  the anticipated sales to end-user customers. The customer finished goods returns accrual represents the Unit Value of the estimated
  returns and is classified as a current liability due to the expectation that these returns will occur within the normal operating cycle
  of one year.

  Income Taxes

  The Company accounts for income taxes using the liability method, which measures deferred income taxes by applying enacted
  statutory rates in effect at the balance sheet date to the differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported
  amounts in the financial statements. The resulting asset or liability is adjusted to reflect changes in the tax laws as they occur. A
  valuation allowance is provided to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax asset
  will not be realized.

  The primary components of the Company’s income tax expense were (i) federal income taxes, (ii) state income taxes, (iii) foreign
  income taxed at rates that are different from the federal statutory rate, (iv) change in realizable deferred tax items, (v) impact of the
  non-deductible executive compensation under Internal Revenue Code Section 162(m), and (vi) income taxes associated with
  uncertain tax positions.

  Realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the Company’s ability to generate sufficient future taxable income. Significant
  judgment is required in determining the Company’s provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation
  allowance recorded against the Company’s net deferred tax assets. The Company makes these estimates and judgments about its
  future taxable income that are based on assumptions that are consistent with the Company’s future plans. A valuation allowance is
  established when the Company believes it is not more likely than not all or some deferred tax assets will be realized. In evaluating
  the Company’s ability to recover deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction in which they arise, the Company considers all
  available positive and negative evidence. Deferred tax assets arising primarily as a result of net operating loss carry-forwards and
  research and development credits in connection with the Company’s Canadian operations have been offset completely by a
  valuation allowance due to the uncertainty of their utilization in future periods. Should the actual amount differ from the
  Company’s estimates, the amount of the valuation allowance could be impacted.

  The Company has made an accounting policy election to recognize the U.S. tax effects of global intangible low-taxed income as a
  component of income tax expense in the period the tax arises.

  Plant and Equipment

  Plant and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation. The cost of additions and improvements are capitalized,
  while maintenance and repairs are charged to expense when incurred. Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis in amounts
  sufficient to relate the cost of depreciable assets to operations over their estimated service lives. Machinery and equipment are
  depreciated over a range from five to ten years. Office equipment and fixtures are depreciated over a range from three to ten years.
  Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the lives of the respective leases or the service lives of the leasehold improvements,
  whichever is shorter. Depreciation of assets recorded under finance leases is included in depreciation expense. The Company
  evaluates plant and equipment, including leasehold improvements, equipment, construction in progress, and right-of-use assets for
  impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable.
  There was no impairment recorded during the years ended March 31, 2022, 2021, or 2020.


                                                                     F-10

  Leases

  The Company determines if an arrangement contains a lease at inception. Lease assets and lease liabilities are recorded based on
  the present value of lease payments over the lease term, which includes the minimum unconditional term of the lease. Certain of
  the Company’s leases include options to extend the leases for up to five years. When the Company has the option to extend the
  lease term, terminate the lease before the contractual expiration date, or purchase the leased asset, and it is reasonably certain that it
  will exercise the option, the option is considered in determining the classification and measurement of the lease. The lease assets
  are recorded net of any lease incentives received. The Company exempts leases with an initial term of 12 months or less from
  balance sheet recognition and, for all classes of assets, combines non-lease components with lease components. Lease assets are
  tested for impairment in the same manner as long-lived assets used in operations.

  The Company uses its incremental borrowing rate for each of its leases in determining the present value of its expected lease
  payments based on the information available at the lease commencement date as the rate implicit for each of its leases is not
  readily detainable. The Company’s incremental borrowing rate is determined by analyzing and combining (i) an applicable risk-
  free rate, (ii) a financial spread adjustment, and (iii) any lease specific adjustment. Certain leases contain provisions for property-
  related costs that are variable in nature for which the Company is responsible, including common area maintenance and other
  property operating services, which are expensed as incurred and not included in the determination of lease assets and lease
  liabilities. These costs are calculated based on a variety of factors including property values, tax and utility rates, property services
  fees, and other factors. The Company records rent expense for operating leases, some of which have escalating rent payments, on a
  straight-line basis over the lease term.

  The Company has material non-functional currency leases. As required for other monetary liabilities, lessees shall remeasure a
  foreign currency-denominated lease liability using the exchange rate at each reporting date, but the lease assets are nonmonetary
  assets measured at historical rates, which are not affected by subsequent changes in the exchange rates. The Company recorded
  gains of $1,989,000 and $9,893,000 during the years ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and a loss of $11,710,000
  during the year ended March 31, 2020, which are included in “foreign exchange impact of lease liabilities and forward contracts”
  in the consolidated statements of operations. See Note 10 for additional information regarding the Company’s leases.

  Goodwill

  The Company evaluates goodwill for impairment at least annually during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or more frequently
  when an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. The goodwill impairment
  test is performed at the reporting unit level, which represents the Company’s operating segments. In testing for goodwill
  impairment, the Company may elect to utilize a qualitative assessment to evaluate whether it is more likely than not that the fair
  value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If the Company’s qualitative assessment indicates that goodwill
  impairment is more likely than not, it will proceed with performing the quantitative assessment. If the fair value of the reporting
  unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill is not considered impaired. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair
  value an impairment loss will be recognized for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value. The
  Company completes the required annual testing of goodwill impairment for each of the reporting units during the fourth quarter of
  the year. No impairment was recorded during the years ended March 31, 2022, 2021, or 2020.

  Intangible Assets

  The Company’s intangible assets other than goodwill are finite–lived and amortized on a straight-line basis over their respective
  useful lives. The Company analyzes its finite-lived intangible assets for impairment when and if indicators of impairment exist. No
  impairment was recorded during the years ended March 31, 2022, 2021, or 2020.

  Debt Issuance Costs

  Debt issuance costs include fees and costs incurred to obtain financing. Debt issuance costs related to the Company’s term loans
  are presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the term loans. Debt issuance costs related to
  the Company’s revolving loan are presented in prepaid expenses and other current assets in the accompanying consolidated
  balance sheets, regardless of whether or not there are any outstanding borrowings under the revolving loan. These fees and costs
  are amortized using the straight-line method, which approximates the effective interest rate method, over the terms of the related
  loans and are included in interest expense in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations.


                                                                     F-11

  Foreign Currency Translation

  For financial reporting purposes, the functional currency of the foreign subsidiaries is the local currency. The assets and liabilities
  of foreign operations for which the local currency is the functional currency are translated into the U.S. dollar at the exchange rate
  in effect at the balance sheet date, while revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates during the year. The
  accumulated foreign currency translation adjustment is presented as a component of comprehensive income or loss in the
  consolidated statements of shareholders’ equity. During the years ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, aggregate foreign currency
  transaction gains of $239,000 and $1,144,000, respectively, and a loss of $789,000 for the year ended March 31, 2020, were
  recorded in general and administrative expenses.

  Revenue Recognition

  Revenue is recognized when performance obligations under the terms of a contract with its customers are satisfied; generally, this
  occurs with the transfer of control of its products. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration the Company expects to
  receive in exchange for transferring goods or providing services. Revenue is recognized net of all anticipated returns, marketing
  allowances, volume discounts, and other forms of variable consideration. Revenue is recognized either when products are shipped
  or when delivered, depending on the applicable contract terms.

  The price of a finished remanufactured product sold to customers is generally comprised of separately invoiced amounts for the
  Remanufactured Core included in the product (“Remanufactured Core value”) and the unit portion included in the product (“Unit
  Value”), for which revenue is recorded based on our then current price list, net of applicable discounts and allowances. The
  Remanufactured Core value is recorded as a net revenue based upon the estimate of Used Cores that will not be returned by the
  customer for credit. These estimates are subjective and based on management’s judgment and knowledge of historical, current, and
  projected return rates. As reconciliations are completed with the customers the actual rates at which Used Cores are not being
  returned may differ from the current estimates. This may result in periodic adjustments of the estimated contract asset and liability
  amounts recorded and may impact the projected revenue recognition rates used to record the estimated future revenue. These
  estimates may also be revised if there are changes in contractual arrangements with customers, or changes in business practices. A
  significant portion of the remanufactured automotive parts sold to customers are replaced by similar Used Cores sent back for
  credit by customers under the core exchange programs (as described in further detail below). The number of Used Cores sent back
  under the core exchange programs is generally limited to the number of similar Remanufactured Cores previously shipped to each
  customer.

  Revenue Recognition — Core Exchange Programs

  Full price Remanufactured Cores: When remanufactured products are shipped, certain customers are invoiced for the
  Remanufactured Core value of the product at the full Remanufactured Core sales price. For these Remanufactured Cores, revenue
  is only recognized based upon an estimate of the rate at which these customers will pay cash for Remanufactured Cores in lieu of
  sending back similar Used Cores for credits under the core exchange programs. The remainder of the full price Remanufactured
  Core value invoiced to these customers is established as a long-term contract liability rather than being recognized as revenue in
  the period the products are shipped as the Company expects these Remanufactured Cores to be returned for credit under its core
  exchange programs.

  Nominal price Remanufactured Cores: Certain other customers are invoiced for the Remanufactured Core value of the product
  shipped at a nominal (generally $0.01 or less) Remanufactured Core price. For these nominal Remanufactured Cores, revenue is
  only recognized based upon an estimate of the rate at which these customers will pay cash for Remanufactured Cores in lieu of
  sending back similar Used Cores for credits under the core exchange programs. Revenue amounts are calculated based on
  contractually agreed upon pricing for these Remanufactured Cores for which the customers are not returning similar Used Cores.
  The remainder of the nominal price Remanufactured Core value invoiced to these customers is established as a long-term contract
  liability rather than being recognized as revenue in the period the products are shipped as the Company expects these
  Remanufactured Cores to be returned for credit under its core exchange programs.


                                                                    F-12

  Revenue Recognition; General Right of Return

  Customers are allowed to return goods that their end-user customers have returned to them, whether or not the returned item is
  defective (warranty returns). In addition, under the terms of certain agreements and industry practice, customers from time to time
  are allowed stock adjustments when their inventory of certain product lines exceeds the anticipated sales to end-user customers
  (stock adjustment returns). Customers have various contractual rights for stock adjustment returns, which are typically less than
  5% of units sold. In some instances, a higher level of returns is allowed in connection with significant restocking orders. The
  aggregate returns are generally limited to less than 20% of unit sales.

  The allowance for warranty returns is established based on a historical analysis of the level of this type of return as a percentage of
  total unit sales. The allowance for stock adjustment returns is based on specific customer inventory levels, inventory movements,
  and information on the estimated timing of stock adjustment returns provided by customers. Stock adjustment returns do not occur
  at any specific time during the year. The return rate for stock adjustments is calculated based on expected returns within the normal
  operating cycle, which is generally one year.

  The Unit Value of the warranty and stock adjustment returns are treated as reductions of revenue based on the estimations made at
  the time of the sale. The Remanufactured Core value of warranty and stock adjustment returns are provided for as indicated in the
  paragraph “Revenue Recognition – Core Exchange Programs”.

  As is standard in the industry, the Company only accepts returns from on-going customers. If a customer ceases doing business
  with the Company, it has no further obligation to accept additional product returns from that customer. Similarly, the Company
  accepts product returns and grants appropriate credits to new customers from the time the new customer relationship is established.

  Shipping Costs

  The Company includes shipping and handling charges in the gross invoice price to customers and classifies the total amount as
  revenue. All shipping and handling costs are expensed as cost of sales as inventory is sold.

  Contract Liability

  Contract liability consists of: (i) customer allowances earned, (ii) accrued core payments, (iii) customer core returns accruals, (iv)
  core bank liability, (v) finished goods liabilities, and (vi) customer deposits.

  Customer allowances earned includes all marketing allowances provided to customers. Such allowances include sales incentives
  and concessions. Voluntary marketing allowances related to a single exchange of product are recorded as a reduction of revenues at
  the time the related revenues are recorded or when such incentives are offered. Other marketing allowances, which may only be
  applied against future purchases, are recorded as a reduction to revenues in accordance with a schedule set forth in the relevant
  contract. Sales incentive amounts are recorded based on the value of the incentive provided. See Note 14 for a description of all
  marketing allowances. Customer allowances to be provided to customers within the Company’s normal operating cycle, which is
  generally one year, are considered short-term contract liabilities and the remainder are recorded as long-term contract liabilities.

  Accrued core payments represent the sales price of Remanufactured Cores purchased from customers, generally in connection with
  new business, which are held by these customers and remain on their premises. The sales price of these Remanufactured Cores will
  be realized when the Company’s relationship with a customer ends, a possibility that the Company considers remote based on
  existing long-term customer agreements and historical experience. The payments to be made to customers for purchases of
  Remanufactured Cores within the Company’s normal operating cycle, which is generally one year, are considered short-term
  contract liabilities and the remainder are recorded as long-term contract liabilities.

  Customer core returns accruals represent the full and nominally priced Remanufactured Cores shipped to the Company’s
  customers. When the Company ships the product, it recognizes an obligation to accept a similar Used Core sent back under the
  core exchange programs based upon the Remanufactured Core price agreed upon by the Company and its customer. The Contract
  liability related to Used Cores returned by consumers to the Company’s customers but not yet returned to the Company are
  classified as short-term contract liabilities until the Company physically receives these Used Cores as they are expected to be
  returned during the Company’s normal operating cycle, which is generally one year and the remainder are recorded as long-term
  contract liabilities.

  The core bank liability represents the full Remanufactured Core sales price paid for cores returned under the core exchange
  programs. The payment for these cores are made over a contractual repayment period pursuant to the Company’s agreement with
  this customer. Payments to be made within the Company’s normal operating cycle, which is generally one year, are considered
  short-term contract liabilities and the remainder are recorded as long-term contract liabilities.

  Finished goods liabilities represents the agreed upon price of finished goods purchased from customers, generally in connection
  with new business. The payment for these finished goods are made over a contractual repayment period pursuant to the Company’s
  agreement with the customer. Payments to be made within the Company’s normal operating cycle, which is generally one year, are
  considered short-term contract liabilities and the remainder are recorded as long-term contract liabilities.

  Customer deposits represent the receipt of prepayments from customers for the obligation to transfer goods or services in the
  future. The Company classifies these customer deposits as short-term contract liabilities as the Company expects to satisfy these
  obligations within its normal operating cycle, which is generally one year.

  Advertising Costs

  The Company expenses all advertising costs as incurred. Advertising expenses for the years ended March 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020
  were $1,007,000, $507,000 and $773,000, respectively.

  Net Income (Loss) Per Share

  Basic net income (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of shares of common
  stock outstanding during the period. Diluted net income (loss) per share includes the effect, if any, from the potential exercise or
  conversion of securities, such as stock options and warrants, which would result in the issuance of incremental shares of common
  stock to the extent such impact is not anti-dilutive.

  The following presents a reconciliation of basic and diluted net income (loss) per share.

                                                                                                 Years Ended March 31,

  Potential common shares that would have the effect of increasing diluted net income per share or decreasing diluted net loss per
  share are considered to be anti-dilutive and as such, these shares are not included in calculating diluted net income (loss) per share.
  For the years ended March 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, there were 725,998, 1,279,251, and 1,738,106, respectively, of potential
  common shares not included in the calculation of diluted net income (loss) per share because their effect was anti-dilutive.

  Use of Estimates

  The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
  States (“GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the consolidated
  financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. On an on-going basis, the Company
  evaluates its estimates, including allowances for credit losses, valuation of inventory, valuation of long-lived assets, goodwill and
  intangible assets, depreciation and amortization of long-lived assets, litigation matters, valuation of deferred tax assets, share-based
  compensation, sales returns and other customer marketing allowances, and the incremental borrowing rate used in determining the
  present value of lease liabilities. Although the Company does not believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a
  material change in the future estimate or in the assumptions used in calculating the estimate, unforeseen changes in the industry, or
  business could materially impact the estimate and may have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and
  results of operations.

  Financial Instruments

  The carrying amounts of cash, short-term investments, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate
  their fair value due to the short-term nature of these instruments. The carrying amounts of the revolving loan, term loan and other
  long-term liabilities approximate their fair value based on current rates for instruments with similar characteristics.

  Share-Based Payments

  The Company has share-based compensation plans and recognizes compensation expense over the requisite service period for its
  share-based plans based on the fair value of the awards on the date of the grant, award or issuance and accounts for forfeitures as
  they occur. Share-based plans include stock option awards, restricted stock units, restricted stock awards, and performance stock
  units issued under the Company’s incentive plans. The cost is measured at the grant date, based on the estimated fair value of the
  award using the Black-Scholes option pricing model for stock options, based on the closing share price of the Company’s stock on
  the grant date for restricted stock units and restricted stock awards, based on the closing share price of the Company’s stock on the
  grant date for performance stock units subject to performance conditions, and based on the estimated fair value of the award using
  the Monte Carlo valuation model for performance stock units subject to market conditions. See Note 18 for further information
  concerning the Company’s share-based payments.

  The Black-Scholes option-pricing model and Monte Carlo valuation model require the input of subjective assumptions including
  the expected volatility of the underlying stock and the expected holding period of the option. These subjective assumptions are
  based on both historical and other information. Changes in the values assumed and used in the model can materially affect the
  estimate of fair value.

  Credit Risk

  The Company regularly reviews its accounts receivable and allowance for credit losses by considering factors such as historical
  experience, credit quality and age of the accounts receivable, and the current economic conditions that may affect a customer’s
  ability to pay. The majority of the Company’s sales are to leading automotive aftermarket parts suppliers. Management believes the
  credit risk with respect to trade accounts receivable is limited due to the Company’s credit evaluation process, the nature of its
  customers, and its accounts receivable discount programs. However, should the Company’s customers experience significant cash
  flow problems, its financial position and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected, and the maximum
  amount of loss that would be incurred would be the outstanding receivable balance, Used Cores expected to be returned by
  customers, and the value of the Remanufactured Cores held at customers’ locations. The Company maintains an allowance for
  credit losses that, in its opinion, provides for an adequate reserve to cover losses that may be incurred.

  Deferred Compensation Plan

  The Company has a deferred compensation plan for certain members of management. The plan allows participants to defer salary
  and bonuses. The assets of the plan, which are held in a trust and are subject to the claims of the Company’s general creditors
  under federal and state laws in the event of insolvency, are recorded as short-term investments in the consolidated balance sheets.
  Consequently, the trust qualifies as a Rabbi trust for income tax purposes. The plan’s assets consist primarily of mutual funds and
  are recorded at market value with any unrealized gain or loss recorded as general and administrative expense. The carrying value
  of plan assets was $2,202,000 and $1,652,000, and the deferred compensation liability, which is included in other current liabilities
  in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, was $2,202,000 and $1,652,000 at March 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
  During the years ended March 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, the Company made contributions of $119,000, $96,000 and $79,000,
  respectively.

  During the year ended March 31, 2022, the Company did not redeem any of its short-term investments for the payment of deferred
  compensation liabilities. During the year ended March 31, 2021, the Company redeemed $46,000 of its short-term investments for
  the payment of deferred compensation liabilities.

  8. Debt

  The Company is party to a $268,620,000 senior secured financing, (as amended from time to time, the “Credit Facility”) with a
  syndicate of lenders and PNC Bank, National Association, as administrative agent, consisting of (i) a $238,620,000 revolving loan
  facility, subject to borrowing base restrictions, a $24,000,000 sublimit for borrowings by Canadian borrowers, and a $20,000,000
  sublimit for letters of credit (the “Revolving Facility”) and (ii) a $30,000,000 term loan facility (the “Term Loans”). The loans
  under the Credit Facility mature on June 5, 2023. The Credit Facility currently permits the payment of up to $29,430,000 of
  dividends and share repurchases for fiscal year 2022, subject to pro forma compliance with financial covenants. In connection with
  the Credit Facility, the lenders have a security interest in substantially all of the assets of the Company.

  In May 2021, the Company entered into a third amendment to the Credit Facility (the “Third Amendment”). The Third
  Amendment, among other things, (i) extended the maturity date from June 5, 2023 to May 28, 2026, (ii) modified the fixed charge
  coverage ratio financial covenant, and (iii) modified the definition of “Consolidated EBITDA”. The Company capitalized
  $1,159,000 of new debt issuance costs in connection with the Third Amendment.

  The Term Loans require quarterly principal payments of $937,500. The Credit Facility bears interest at rates equal to either LIBOR
  plus a margin of 2.25%, 2.50% or 2.75% or a reference rate plus a margin of 1.25%, 1.50% or 1.75%, in each case depending on
  the senior leverage ratio as of the applicable measurement date. There is also a facility fee of 0.375% to 0.50%, depending on the
  senior leverage ratio as of the applicable measurement date. The interest rate on the Company’s Term Loans and Revolving
  Facility was 2.99% and 3.13% respectively, at March 31, 2022, and 2.62% at March 31, 2021.

  The Credit Facility, among other things, requires the Company to maintain certain financial covenants including a maximum senior
  leverage ratio and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio. The Company was in compliance with all financial covenants at March
  31, 2022.

  The Company had cash of $23,016,000 at March 31, 2022, however, the Credit Facility allows up to $6,000,000 of credit for cash
  when computing the senior leverage ratio. In addition to other covenants, the Credit Facility places limits on the Company’s ability
  to incur liens, incur additional indebtedness, make loans and investments, engage in mergers and acquisitions, engage in asset
  sales, redeem, or repurchase capital stock, alter the business conducted by the Company and its subsidiaries, transact with
  affiliates, prepay, redeem, or purchase subordinated debt, and amend or otherwise alter debt agreements.

  10. Leases

  The Company leases various facilities in North America and Asia under operating leases expiring through August 2033. During the
  first quarter of fiscal 2022, the Company renewed the lease for its corporate headquarters in Torrance, California, for an additional
  10-year period, which resulted in an increase in the operating lease liability of $15,537,000. The Company also has finance leases
  for certain office and manufacturing equipment, which generally range from three to five years.

  The Company has material non-functional currency leases, which resulted in a remeasurement gains of $1,989,000 and $9,893,000
  during the years ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and a loss of $11,710,000 during the year ended March 31, 2020.
  These remeasurement gains are included in “foreign exchange impact of lease liabilities and forward contracts” in the consolidated
  statements of operations.

  11. Accounts Receivable Discount Programs

  The Company uses receivable discount programs with certain customers and their respective banks. Under these programs, the
  Company may sell those customers’ receivables to those banks at a discount to be agreed upon at the time the receivables are sold.
  These discount arrangements allow the Company to accelerate receipt of payment on customers’ receivables.

  The following is a summary of the Company’s accounts receivable discount programs:

                                                                                                     Fiscal Years Ended March 31,

  12. Financial Risk Management and Derivatives

  Purchases and expenses denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, which are primarily related to the Company’s
  facilities overseas, expose the Company to market risk from material movements in foreign exchange rates between the U.S. dollar
  and the foreign currencies. The Company’s primary risk exposure is from fluctuations in the value of the Mexican peso and to a
  lesser extent the Chinese yuan. To mitigate these risks, the Company enters into forward foreign currency exchange contracts to
  exchange U.S. dollars for these foreign currencies. The extent to which forward foreign currency exchange contracts are used is
  modified periodically in response to the Company’s estimate of market conditions and the terms and length of anticipated
  requirements.

  The Company enters into forward foreign currency exchange contracts in order to reduce the impact of foreign currency
  fluctuations and not to engage in currency speculation. The use of derivative financial instruments allows the Company to reduce
  its exposure to the risk that the eventual cash outflow resulting from funding the expenses of the foreign operations will be
  materially affected by changes in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the foreign currencies. The Company does not hold
  or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. The forward foreign currency exchange contracts are designated for forecasted
  expenditure requirements to fund foreign operations.

  The Company had forward foreign currency exchange contracts with a U.S. dollar equivalent notional value of $44,968,000 and
  $41,819,000 at March 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. These contracts generally have a term of one year or less, at rates agreed at
  the inception of the contracts. The counterparty to this derivative transaction is a major financial institution with investment grade
  credit rating; however, the Company is exposed to credit risk with this institution. The credit risk is limited to the potential
  unrealized gains (which offset currency fluctuations adverse to the Company) in any such contract should this counterparty fail to
  perform as contracted. Any changes in the fair values of forward foreign currency exchange contracts are included in “foreign
  exchange impact of lease liabilities and forward contracts” in the consolidated statements of operations.

  the consolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended March 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020.

  13. Fair Value Measurements

  The Company defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in
  the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the
  measurement date. The Company uses a three-tier valuation hierarchy based upon observable and unobservable inputs:

       •    Level 1 — Valuation is based upon quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

       •    Level 2 — Valuation is based upon quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, or other inputs that are
            observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument.

       •    Level 3 — Valuation is based upon unobservable inputs that are significant to the fair value measurement.

  The fair value hierarchy requires the use of observable market data when available. In instances in which the inputs used to
  measure fair value fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy, the fair value measurement has been determined based on
  the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The Company’s assessment of the significance
  of a particular item to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment, including the consideration of inputs specific to
  the asset or liability.

  Short-term Investments and Deferred Compensation

  The Company’s short-term investments, which fund its deferred compensation liabilities, consist of investments in mutual funds.
  These investments are classified as Level 1 as the shares of these mutual funds trade with sufficient frequency and volume to
  enable the Company to obtain pricing information on an ongoing basis.

  Forward Foreign Currency Exchange Contracts

  The forward foreign currency exchange contracts are primarily measured based on the foreign currency spot and forward rates
  quoted by the banks or foreign currency dealers (See Note 12).

  Contingent Consideration

  In December 2018, the Company completed the acquisition of certain assets and assumption of certain liabilities from Mechanical
  Power Conversion, LLC (“E&M”). The Company was contingently obligated to make additional payments to the former owners of
  E&M up to an aggregate of $5,200,000 over a three-year period. During the year ended March 31, 2022, the Company paid
  $977,000 to the former owners of E&M.

  During the years ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had no significant measurements of assets or liabilities at fair
  value on a nonrecurring basis subsequent to their initial recognition.

  The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate their
  fair value due to the short-term nature of these instruments. The carrying amounts of the revolving loan, term loan and other long-
  term liabilities approximate their fair value based on the variable nature of interest rates and current rates for instruments with
  similar characteristics.

  14. Commitments and Contingencies

  Warranty Returns

  The Company allows its customers to return goods that their consumers have returned to them, whether or not the returned item is
  defective (“warranty returns”). The Company accrues an estimate of its exposure to warranty returns based on a historical analysis
  of the level of this type of return as a percentage of total unit sales. Amounts charged to expense for these warranty returns are
  considered in arriving at the Company’s net sales.

  The following summarizes the changes in the warranty return accrual:

                                                                                                 Years Ended March 31,

  Commitments to Provide Marketing Allowances under Long-Term Customer Contracts

  The Company has or is renegotiating long-term agreements with many of its major customers. Under these agreements, which in
  most cases have initial terms of at least four years, the Company is designated as the exclusive or primary supplier for specified
  categories of the Company’s products. Because of the very competitive nature of the market and the limited number of customers
  for these products, the Company’s customers have sought and obtained price concessions, significant marketing allowances, and
  more favorable delivery and payment terms in consideration for the Company’s designation as a customer’s exclusive or primary
  supplier. These incentives differ from contract to contract and can include (i) the issuance of a specified amount of credits against
  receivables in accordance with a schedule set forth in the relevant contract, (ii) support for a particular customer’s research or
  marketing efforts provided on a scheduled basis, (iii) discounts granted in connection with each individual shipment of product,
  and (iv) other marketing, research, store expansion or product development support. These contracts typically require that the
  Company meet ongoing performance standards. While these longer-term agreements strengthen the Company’s customer
  relationships, the increased demand for the Company’s products often requires that the Company increase its inventories and
  personnel. Customer demands that the Company purchase their Remanufactured Core inventory also require the use of the
  Company’s working capital.

  The marketing and other allowances the Company typically grants its customers in connection with its new or expanded customer
  relationships adversely impact the near-term revenues, profitability, and associated cash flows from these arrangements. Such
  allowances include sales incentives and concessions and typically consist of: (i) allowances which may only be applied against
  future purchases and are recorded as a reduction to revenues in accordance with a schedule set forth in the long-term contract, (ii)
  allowances related to a single exchange of product that are recorded as a reduction of revenues at the time the related revenues are
  recorded or when such incentives are offered, and (iii) amortization of core premiums paid to customers generally in connection
  with new business.

  Contingencies

  The Company is subject to various lawsuits and claims. In addition, government agencies and self-regulatory organizations have
  the ability to conduct periodic examinations of and administrative proceedings regarding the Company’s business. Following an
  audit in fiscal 2019, the U.S. Customs and Border Protection stated that it believed that the Company owed additional duties of
  approximately $17 million from 2011 through mid-2018 relating to products that it imported from Mexico. The Company does not
  believe that this amount is correct and believes that it has numerous defenses and is disputing this amount vigorously. The
  Company cannot assure that the U.S. Customs and Border Protection will agree or that it will not need to accrue or pay additional
  amounts in the future.

  As of March 31, 2022, the Company had federal net operating loss carryforwards of $789,000 related to its January 2019
  acquisition, state net operating loss carryforwards of $537,000 and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $16,709,000. The
  federal net operating loss carryforwards expire beginning in fiscal year 2033, the state net operating loss carryforwards expire
  beginning in fiscal year 2033, and the foreign net operating loss carryforwards expire beginning in fiscal year 2038. As of March
  31, 2022, the Company also had non-US tax credit carryforwards of $2,018,000, which will expire beginning in fiscal year 2034. A
  full valuation allowance was established on the federal and foreign net operating loss and tax credits carryforward as the Company
  believes it is more likely than not these tax attributes would not be realizable in the future. The net increase in the valuation
  allowance was $653,000 during the year ended March 31, 2022.

  Realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the Company’s ability to generate sufficient future taxable income. Significant
  judgment is required in determining the Company’s provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation
  allowance recorded against the Company’s net deferred tax assets. The Company makes these estimates and judgments about its
  future taxable income that are based on assumptions that are consistent with the Company’s future plans. A valuation allowance is
  established when the Company believes it is not more likely than not all or some deferred tax assets will be realized. In evaluating
  the Company’s ability to recover deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction in which they arise, the Company considers all
  available positive and negative evidence. Deferred tax assets arising primarily as a result of non-US net operating loss carry-
  forwards and non-US research and development credits in connection with the Company’s Canadian operations have been offset
  completely by a valuation allowance due to the uncertainty of their utilization in future periods. Should the actual amount differ
  from the Company’s estimates, the amount of the valuation allowance could be impacted.

  For the years ended March 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, the primary components of the Company’s income tax expense were (i)
  federal income taxes, (ii) state income taxes, (iii) foreign income taxed at rates that are different from the federal statutory rate, (iv)
  change in realizable deferred tax items, (v) impact of the non-deductible executive compensation under Internal Revenue Code
  Section 162(m), and (vi) income taxes associated with uncertain tax positions

  The Company and its subsidiaries file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions
  with varying statutes of limitations. At March 31, 2022, the Company is not under examination in any jurisdiction and the years
  ended March 31, 2017 through 2022 remain subject to examination. The Company believes no significant changes in the
  unrecognized tax benefits will occur within the next 12 months.

  A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:

                                                                                                  Years Ended March 31,

  At March 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, there are $1,632,000, $923,000, and $823,000, respectively, of unrecognized tax benefits that
  if recognized would affect the annual effective tax rate.

  The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as part of income tax expense. During the
  years ended March 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, the Company recognized interest and penalties of approximately $112,000,
  $(16,000), and $(50,000), respectively. The Company had approximately $170,000 and $58,000 for the payment of interest and
  penalties accrued at March 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

  With the exception of its earnings from its Singapore subsidiary, the Company intends to indefinitely reinvest its undistributed
  earnings from foreign subsidiaries in foreign operations. No incremental U.S. Federal tax or withholding taxes have been provided
  for these earnings.

  been exercised on March 31, 2022 based on the Company’s closing stock price of $17.83 as of that date.

  At March 31, 2022, there was $1,065,000 of total unrecognized compensation expense from stock-based compensation granted
  under the plans, which is related to non-vested shares. The compensation expense is expected to be recognized over a weighted
  average vesting period of 1.0 year.

  Restricted Stock Units and Restricted Stock (collectively “RSUs”)

  During the years ended March 31, 2022 and 2021 the Company granted 263,703 and 251,801 shares of RSUs, respectively, with an
  estimated grant date fair value of $5,775,000 and $4,150,000, respectively, which was based on the closing market price on the
  date of grant. The fair value related to these awards is recognized as compensation expense over the vesting period. These awards
  generally vest in three equal installments beginning each anniversary from the grant date, subject to continued employment. Upon
  vesting, these awards may be net share settled to cover the required withholding tax with the remaining amount converted into an
  equivalent number of shares of common stock. Total shares withheld during the years ended March 31, 2022 and 2021 were
  84,762 and 22,202, respectively, based on the value of these awards as determined by the Company’s closing stock price on the
  vesting date.

  As of March 31, 2022, there was $4,080,000 of unrecognized compensation expense related to these awards, which will be
  recognized over the remaining vesting period of approximately 1.5 years.

  Performance Stock Units (“PSUs”)

  In June 2021, the Company granted performance-based PSUs to its executives, which typically cliff vest after three-years subject
  to continued employment. These awards are contingent and granted separately for each of the following metrics: adjusted
  EBITDA, net sales, and relative total shareholder return (“TSR”). Compensation cost is determined at the grant date and
  recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period to the extent the conditions are deemed probable. The number
  of shares earned at the end of the three-year period will vary, based only on actual performance, from 0% to 150% of the target
  number of PSUs granted. PSUs are not considered issued or outstanding ordinary shares of the Company.

  Adjusted EBITDA and net sales are considered performance conditions. The Company will reassess the probability of achieving
  each performance condition separately at each reporting period. TSR is considered a market condition because it measures the
  Company’s return against the performance of the Russell 3000, excluding companies classified as financials and real estate, over a
  given period of time. Compensation cost related to the TSR award will not be adjusted even if the market condition is not met.

  The Company calculated the fair value of the PSUs for each component individually. The fair value of PSUs subject to
  performance conditions is equal to the closing stock price on the grant date. The fair value of PSUs subject to the market condition
  is determined using the Monte Carlo valuation model.

  The aggregate market value of the voting and non-voting common equity held by non-affiliates of the registrant as of June 30, 2022, the last business
  day of the registrant’s most recently completed second fiscal quarter, was approximately $12.3 billion based upon the closing price reported for such
  date on the Nasdaq Global Select Market. For purposes of such calculation, the registrant has assumed that all outstanding shares of common equity are
  held by non-affiliates, except for shares held by each of the registrant’s executive officers, directors, and 5% or greater stockholders. In the case of 5% or
  greater stockholders, we have not deemed such stockholders to be affiliates unless there are facts and circumstances which would indicate that such
  stockholders exercise any control over the registrant. These assumptions should not be deemed to constitute an admission that all executive officers,
  directors, and 5% or greater stockholders are, in fact, affiliates of the registrant, or that there are not other persons who may be deemed to be affiliates
  of the registrant. This determination of affiliate status is not necessarily a conclusive determination for other purposes.

  As of February 14, 2023, 919,265,013 shares of the registrant's Class A common stock were outstanding, and 7,825,000 shares of the registrant's Class B
  common stock were outstanding.

  Portions of the registrant’s definitive Proxy Statement related to its 2023 Annual Meeting of Stockholders to be filed with the Securities and Exchange
  Commission within 120 days after the end of the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 are incorporated by reference into Part III of this Form 10-K.

  Forward-Looking Statements

  This Annual Report on Form 10-K (“Form 10-K”) contains forward-looking statements. We intend such forward-looking statements
  to be covered by the safe harbor provisions for forward-looking statements contained in Section 27A of the Securities Act of
  1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange
  Act”). All statements other than statements of historical facts contained in this Form 10-K may be forward-looking statements. In
  some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terms such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “expects,” “plans,”
  “anticipates,” “could,” “intends,” “targets,” “projects,” “contemplates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “forecasts,” “predicts,” “potential”
  or “continue” or the negative of these terms or other similar expressions. Forward-looking statements contained in this Form 10-
  K include, but are not limited to statements regarding our future results of operations and financial position, industry and
  business trends, equity compensation, business strategy, plans, market growth, plans and objectives relating to our climate
  commitment, and our objectives for future operations.

  The forward-looking statements in this Form 10-K are only predictions. We have based these forward-looking statements largely
  on our current expectations and projections about future events and financial trends that we believe may affect our business,
  financial condition, and results of operations. Forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and
  other important factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any
  future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements, including, but not limited
  to, the important factors discussed in Part I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors” in this Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 and
  other important factors discussed in this report and from time to time in our other filings with the SEC. The forward-looking
  statements in this Form 10-K are based upon information available to us as of the date of this Form 10-K, and while we believe
  such information forms a reasonable basis for such statements, such information may be limited or incomplete, and our
  statements should not be read to indicate that we have conducted an exhaustive inquiry into, or review of, all potentially
  available relevant information. These statements are inherently uncertain and investors are cautioned not to unduly rely upon
  these statements.

  You should read this Form 10-K and the documents that we reference in this Form 10-K and have filed as exhibits to this Form 10-
  K with the understanding that our actual future results, performance, and achievements may be materially different from what
  we expect. We qualify all of our forward-looking statements by these cautionary statements. These forward-looking statements
  speak only as of the date of this Form 10-K. Except as required by applicable law, we do not plan to publicly update or revise any
  forward-looking statements contained in this Form 10-K, whether as a result of any new information, future events or otherwise.

  As used in this Form 10-K, unless otherwise stated or the context requires otherwise, references to “Rivian,” the “Company,”
  “we,” “us,” and “our,” refer to Rivian Automotive, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.

  Summary of Risk Factors

  Our business is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those described in Part I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors” in this
  Form 10-K. The principal risks and uncertainties affecting our business include the following:

       •    We are a growth stage company with limited operating history and a history of losses and expect to incur significant
            expenses and continuing losses for the foreseeable future. We may underestimate or not effectively manage the capital
            expenditures and costs associated with our business and operations, which could have a material and adverse effect on
            our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. We may also require additional
            financing to support our business, which may not be available in a timely manner or on terms that are acceptable, or at
            all.
       •    Our ability to develop and manufacture vehicles of sufficient quality and appeal to customers on schedule and on a large
            scale is unproven, and we have experienced, and may in the future experience, significant delays in the manufacture and
            delivery of our vehicles, which could harm our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations, and cash
            flows.
       •    We have experienced, and could experience in the future, cost increases and disruptions in supply of raw materials or
            other components used in our vehicles.
       •    We are dependent on our existing suppliers, a significant number of which are single or limited source suppliers, and are
            also dependent on our ability to source suppliers, for our critical components, and to complete the building out of our
            supply chain, while effectively managing the risks due to such relationships.




                                                                    2

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1874178/000187417823000009/rivn-20221231.htm                                                 5/135
26/04/23, 09:03                                                             rivn-20221231

                                                     RIVIAN AUTOMOTIVE, INC.


       •    We depend upon third parties to manufacture and to supply key semiconductor chip components necessary for our
            vehicles. We do not have long-term agreements with all of our semiconductor chip manufacturers and suppliers, and if
            these manufacturers or suppliers become unwilling or unable to provide an adequate supply of semiconductor chips,
            with respect to which there is a global shortage, we would not be able to find alternative sources in a timely manner and
            our business would be adversely impacted.
       •    We expect that a significant portion of our near-term revenue will be from one customer that is an affiliate of one of our
            principal stockholders. If we are unable to maintain this relationship or if this customer purchases significantly fewer
            vehicles than we currently anticipate, then our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations, and cash
            flows could be materially and adversely affected.
       •    The success of our business depends on attracting and retaining a large number of customers. If we are unable to do so,
            we will not be able to achieve profitability.
       •    The automotive market is highly competitive, and we may not be successful in competing in this industry.
       •    We are highly dependent on the services and reputation of Robert J. Scaringe, our Founder and Chief Executive Officer
            (“CEO”).
       •    Our distribution model is different from the predominant current distribution model for automobile manufacturers and
            is subject to regulatory limitations on our ability to sell and service vehicles directly, which subjects us to substantial risk
            and makes evaluating our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows difficult.
       •    Breaches in data security, failure of information security systems, cyber attacks or other security or privacy-related
            incidents could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and brand, harm our business, prospects, financial
            condition, results of operations, and cash flows and subject us to legal or regulatory fines or damages.
       •    We are, and may in the future become, subject to patent, trademark and/or other intellectual property infringement
            claims, which may be time-consuming, cause us to incur significant liability, and increase our costs of doing business.
       •    Our vehicles are subject to motor vehicle safety standards and the failure to satisfy such mandated safety standards
            would have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations, and cash
            flows.
       •    We may be exposed to delays, limitations, and risks related to the environmental permits and other permits and
            approvals required to operate or expand operations at our manufacturing facility and any future facilities.

                                                                   PART I

  Item 1. Business

  Overview

  Rivian exists to create products and services that help our planet transition to carbon neutral energy and transportation. Rivian
  designs, develops, and manufactures category-defining electric vehicles (“EVs”) and accessories and sells them directly to
  customers in the consumer and commercial markets. Rivian complements its vehicles with a full suite of proprietary, value-added
  services that address the entire lifecycle of the vehicle and deepen its customer relationships.

  Starting with a clean sheet, we built a vertically integrated ecosystem comprised of our vehicle technology platform, cloud
  architecture, product development and operations, products, and services. Interconnected by our data and analytics backbone,
  our ecosystem is designed to deliver fast-paced innovation cycles, structural cost advantages, and exceptional customer
  experiences.

  Our Products and Services

  Consumer Vehicles

  Engineered for all of life’s adventures, our Electric Adventure Vehicles combine performance, utility, and efficiency. In the
  consumer market, we launched the R1 platform with our first generation of consumer vehicles: the R1T, a two-row, five-
  passenger pickup truck, and the R1S, a three-row, seven-passenger sport utility vehicle (“SUV”).




                                                                      3

                                                    RIVIAN AUTOMOTIVE, INC.


  R1T

  The R1T is a category-defining electric pickup truck, providing a combination of performance, utility, and capability without
  compromising on sustainability. The R1T is capable of carrying five passengers and large loads with a bed that is 54 inches long
  with the tailgate up (84 inches long with tailgate down) and 50 inches wide.

  R1S

  The R1S is a large format all-electric SUV, with enough space to comfortably fit up to seven passengers and their gear. Utilizing the
  same battery, propulsion, and chassis systems as the R1T, R1S customers can expect the same combination of on- and off-road
  performance.

  The R1T and R1S are equipped with a proprietary set of advanced technology systems, including vehicle electronics, battery,
  electric drive, chassis, Driver+, our advanced driver assistance system (“ADAS”), and digital user experience management. These
  technologies can continuously improve and expand functionality through cloud-enabled over-the-air (“OTA”) updates.

  The R1T and R1S introduced our brand to the world and serve as our flagship vehicles as we continue to expand our offerings. To
  accompany our vehicles, we have developed a comprehensive portfolio of vehicle accessories that further sharpen our brand’s
  focus on adventure and active lifestyles.

  Consumer Services

  Complementing our consumer vehicles, our current suite of value-added services includes digitally enabled financing, telematics-
  based insurance, proactive vehicle service (maintenance and repair), software services, and charging solutions. These services will
  generate long-term brand loyalty while also creating a recurring revenue stream for each vehicle across its lifecycle.

  Charging Solutions

  We are providing charging solutions that include Rivian Adventure Network Direct Current fast charging sites (“Rivian Adventure
  Network”) and Rivian Waypoints chargers. Our solutions are designed to be cost effective and aim to deliver clean energy to our
  customers while offering a convenient and seamless charging experience. In addition, our vehicles use the Combined Charging
  Standard (“CCS”) connection which enables our customers to leverage other nationwide networks.

  Commercial Vehicles

  In the commercial market, we launched the Rivian Commercial Vehicle (“RCV”) platform, which underpins the Electric Delivery
  Van (“EDV”), designed and engineered by Rivian in collaboration with Amazon.com, Inc. and its affiliates (collectively, “Amazon”),
  our first commercial customer. The EDV is a long-range, electric commercial step-in van designed for large-scale production and
  deployment in a centrally managed fleet. Amazon has ordered an initial volume of 100,000 vehicles globally, subject to
  modification.

  Developed to be comfortable and easy to operate for drivers, our commercial vehicles are designed to achieve lower total cost of
  ownership (“TCO”) for customers while supporting a path to carbon neutral deliveries.

  EDV-700

  The EDV-700 is the 700 cubic foot version of the EDV. The vehicle’s design is optimized for last mile delivery use cases and
  includes a rear roll-up door ideal for warehouse bulk loading, which eliminates cargo area side doors that would otherwise
  consume valuable precious cargo storage. The vehicle’s features also include an integrated automatic bulkhead door designed for
  safety and security, a tall roof to allow drivers to walk through the vehicle, driver-centric ergonomics creating space for package
  handling, and a curb-side sliding door designed for ease of package handling and safe vehicle access away from traffic.

  Our ecosystem is designed to be highly scalable, flexible, integrated, and interconnected to power an immersive customer
  journey. This will enable us to maximize our impact by addressing both the consumer and commercial markets simultaneously.
  We can deploy our offerings at scale using a shared, vertically integrated technology platform, comprised of vehicle technology
  and Rivian Cloud, with network effects that will build data insights to improve our ecosystem. By utilizing our common technology
  platform, we generate synergies and scale efficiencies, enabling us to increase our pace of innovation and create offerings that
  serve the unique needs of our customers. Our direct-to-customer relationships and connected vehicle technologies allow us to
  gather customer and product insights over the full lifecycle of our vehicles. We will utilize these insights to continuously improve
  our offerings by adding new capabilities and functionality. Enhanced offerings will attract more customers, deepen existing
  customer relationships, and expand our data repository and insights, which will further benefit our customers and Rivian.

  Manufacturing

  We currently manufacture all vehicles on the R1 and RCV platforms at our manufacturing facility in Normal, Illinois (“Normal
  Factory”), which is equipped to produce up to 150,000 vehicles annually when the equipment is operated at full rate and on
  multiple shifts. This annual installed capacity is currently comprised of approximately 65,000 vehicles for the R1 platform and
  85,000 vehicles for the RCV platform. In addition, we have announced plans to construct a second manufacturing facility near
  Atlanta, Georgia with an anticipated capacity to produce 400,000 vehicles annually. We plan to build the plant in two phases,
  each consisting of 200,000 units of annual capacity. We plan to produce our next generation consumer vehicle platform, the R2,
  at this facility.

  Supply Chain

  We procure materials and components from hundreds of suppliers across the globe that we work closely with to bring our
  vehicles to market.

  Our supplier selection process is based on a wide variety of factors, including technical expertise, product quality, cost, and
  location. With many suppliers, our relationship extends beyond the procurement of raw materials and components as we
  collaborate through the development process. We believe these strategic partnerships have led to pricing and timing advantages
  in the development of our vehicles.

  Our products contain thousands of parts that we purchase from hundreds of mostly single- or limited-source suppliers, for which
  no immediate or readily-available alternative supplier exists. In order to mitigate risks related to a single source of supply, we
  qualify alternative suppliers and manufacturers when possible, and develop contingency plans for responding to disruptions, such
  as carrying higher inventory levels where possible. Despite these actions, we have faced and may still continue to face, challenges
  with various manufacturing-related component shortages, especially as our suppliers scale their operations to match our vehicle
  ramp rate.

  Seasonality

  Historically, the automotive industry has experienced higher revenue in the spring and summer months. Additionally, we expect
  volumes of commercial vehicle sales to be less in the winter months, as customers shift their focus to making last mile deliveries
  during holidays, rather than incorporating more vehicles into their fleet. We do not expect such seasonality in demand to
  significantly impact our operations in the near-term as we scale our business due to our backlog of preorders; however, we may
  experience seasonal variations in our business in the long-term.

  Competition

  We aspire to drive meaningful change in the world’s transition to sustainable mobility. We believe multiple industry tailwinds
  such as regulatory support and shifting consumer demand will continue to drive a transition from legacy internal combustion
  engine (“ICE”) vehicles to EVs. We believe the primary competitive factors in our markets are talent and culture, technological
  innovation, product performance and quality, customer experience, brand differentiation, product design, pricing and TCO, and
  manufacturing scale and efficiency.

  Our competition includes the millions of traditional ICE vehicles and EVs sold each year in the consumer and commercial markets.
  Our competitive set also represents our total addressable market (“TAM”) which we aim to target over the long term with an
  expanded product portfolio in our current and future geographies.

  As we participate across the spectrum of the consumer and commercial value chain, our competition extends beyond providers
  that operate in the capacity of an original equipment manufacturer or dealer. Downstream competitors include a collection of
  third parties such as charging providers, vehicle service providers, vehicle remarketers, and traditional fleet management
  companies.

  Across the automotive value chain, we believe our vertically integrated business model and technology platform, focus on
  customer experience, direct-to-customer relationships, and ability to efficiently launch multiple vehicle platforms position us to
  compete effectively.

  Regulatory

  Environmental, Health and Safety Matters

  Certain of our operations, properties, and products are subject to stringent and comprehensive federal, state, and local laws and
  regulations governing matters related to environmental protection, occupational health and safety, and the release or discharge
  of materials into the environment, including air emissions and wastewater discharges. Failure to comply with these laws and
  regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, the imposition of investigatory and
  remedial obligations and the issuance of orders enjoining some or all of our operations in affected areas.

  We are also subject to permitting, registration, and other government approval requirements under environmental, health, and
  safety laws and regulations applicable in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Those requirements obligate us to obtain permits,
  registrations, and other government approvals from one or more governmental agencies to conduct our operations and sell our
  products. The requirements vary depending on the location where our regulated activities are conducted.

  The following summarizes certain existing environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations applicable to our operations
  and products. For additional information, see Part I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors.”
  Regulations in the United States of America (“United States”)

       •    National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (“NHTSA”) Safety and Self-Certification Obligations. As a manufacturer
            of EVs, our vehicles are subject to, and must comply with, numerous regulatory requirements established by NHTSA,
            including all applicable United States Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (“Safety Standards”). Under the National
            Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act, we must certify that our vehicles meet all applicable Safety Standards, as well as the
            NHTSA bumper standard, or are otherwise exempt from such standards. The categories of Safety Standards that apply to
            our vehicles include crashworthiness requirements, crash avoidance requirements, and EV requirements. The R1T, R1S,
            and EDV are fully compliant with all such Safety Standards and other NHTSA requirements without the need for any
            additional exemptions.

            We are also required to comply with or demonstrate exemptions from other requirements of federal laws administered
            by NHTSA, including the Federal Corporate Average Fuel Economy (“CAFE”) standards, Theft Prevention Act
            requirements, consumer information labeling requirements, Early Warning Reporting requirements regarding warranty
            claims, field reports, death and injury reports and foreign recalls, and owner’s manual requirements. The R1T, R1S and
            EDV are fully compliant with or exempted from compliance with the foregoing referenced standards. Rivian also has a
            system in place to ensure compliance with all reporting obligations to NHTSA.

            The Automobile Information and Disclosure Act requires manufacturers of motor vehicles to disclose certain information
            regarding the manufacturer’s suggested retail price, optional equipment, and pricing. In addition, the Automobile
            Information and Disclosure Act allows inclusion of city and highway fuel economy ratings, as determined by the United
            States Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”), as well as crash test ratings as determined by NHTSA if such tests are
            conducted.

       •    EPA Certificate of Conformity and California Executive Order. The Clean Air Act requires that we obtain both an EPA-
            issued Certificate of Conformity and a California Air Resources Board (“CARB”)-issued Executive Order with respect to
            emissions for our vehicles, and include labeling providing consumer information such as miles per gallon of gas-
            equivalent ratings and maximum range on a single charge. The R1T, R1S, and EDV have received EPA Certificates of
            Conformity and California Executive Orders for model years 2022 and 2023.

26/04/23, 09:03                                                           rivn-20221231

                                                    RIVIAN AUTOMOTIVE, INC.




       •    Battery Safety and Testing. Our battery pack conforms to mandatory regulations that govern transport of “dangerous
            goods,” defined to include lithium-ion batteries, which may present a risk in transportation. Governing regulations,
            issued by the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, are based on the United Nations (“UN”)
            Recommendations and Model Regulations on the Transport of Dangerous Goods, as well as related UN Manual of Tests
            and Criteria. The regulations vary by mode of shipping transportation, such as by ocean vessel, rail, truck, or air. We have
            completed the applicable transportation tests for our prototype and production battery packs, demonstrating our
            compliance with the UN Manual of Tests and Criteria.

            We also subject our battery packs to selected tests specified in the Society of Automotive Engineers (“SAE”) J2464 and
            J2929 standards, as well as tests defined by other standards and regulatory bodies and Rivian’s own internal tests. These
            tests evaluate battery function and performance as well as resilience to conditions including immersion, humidity, fire,
            and other potential hazards. We currently use lithium metal oxide cells in our high voltage battery packs. Our battery
            packs include certain packaging materials that contain trace amounts of hazardous chemicals whose use, storage, and
            disposal is regulated under federal and state laws.

            If a customer wishes to dispose of a battery pack from one of our vehicles, we will accept the depleted battery without
            any additional charge.

       •    Right to Repair. We are also subject to certain laws and regulations, e.g., “Right to Repair,” laws, that would require us to
            provide third-party access to our network and/or vehicle systems.

  Emission Credit Programs

  As a manufacturer devoted to the design, development, and production of all-electric, battery-powered vehicles, we will generate
  credits from regulatory mandates that we can monetize through sale to other manufacturers. For example, in connection with the
  delivery and placement into service of our zero-emission vehicles in California and a number of other states that have adopted
  the California standards applicable to light-duty and heavy-duty vehicles, we have earned and will continue to earn tradable light-
  duty and heavy-duty zero-emission vehicle (“ZEV”) credits that can be monetized.

  In addition to state level credits, the EPA and NHTSA also mandate minimum greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions and CAFE
  standards applicable to light- and heavy-duty vehicles. Under the Biden Administration, a final rule was issued in late 2021 that
  increased the stringency of these standards. These federal regulations require that manufacturers of light- and heavy-duty
  vehicles meet minimum standards pertaining to GHG emissions and fuel economy based on a vehicle’s footprint or overall
  dimensions. As the first manufacturer to produce zero-emission vehicles of this larger footprint at scale, we expect to generate
  substantial GHG and CAFE credits, and to benefit financially from these regulations. In addition, in 2022, the EPA reinstated
  California’s ability to establish its own emission standards in lieu of the federal standards. As a result, California regulators
  extended the Advanced Clean Cars rule for model years 2026 through 2035. These standards, which as many as 17 other states
  have also adopted, are more stringent than federal requirements, thus providing additional credit generating opportunities for
  Rivian through potential sales of those credits by the Company.

  Automobile Manufacturer and Dealer Regulation

  State laws regulate the manufacture, distribution, sale, and service (including delivery) of automobiles, and generally require
  motor vehicle manufacturers and dealers to be licensed in order to sell vehicles directly to customers in the state. As of
  December 31, 2022, 25 states and the District of Columbia permit us, as a manufacturer of motor vehicles, to apply for and
  receive a dealer license to conduct vehicle sales, provided we meet certain requirements. Once licensed in one or more of these
  25 states, we may sell our vehicles to any consumer in the United States as a matter of interstate commerce. By contrast, 25
  states restrict our ability to obtain a dealer license to sell within those states. To sell vehicles to residents of states where we do
  not have a license or are unable to be licensed due to our status as a manufacturer, we must conduct the sale out of state over
  the internet or telephonically. Rivian currently has dealer licenses to sell vehicles directly in four states. We also have pending
  applications for dealer licenses to sell vehicles in another five states.

  Automobile Manufacturer Regulation in Canada

  Our vehicles available for sale in the Canadian market are subject to environmental and safety certifications administered by the
  appropriate Canadian regulatory authorities, including, but not limited to Transport Canada and Environment Canada. We

  have obtained all required national certifications to enable sales in Canada for 2022 and 2023. Unlike the United States, there are
  no impediments to a manufacturer applying for and receiving a dealer license to perform sales and service, however, we must
  obtain the necessary provincial licenses to enable sales and service in each location. We have these licenses in British Columbia
  and are in the process of obtaining the remaining licenses in the other provinces of Canada.

  Federal and State Incentives in the United States
  As of December 31, 2022, incentives in the United States included:
      • United States Federal Tax Credits. The Qualified Plug-In Electric Drive Motor Vehicle Tax Credit program instituted by the
           United States government provides a tax credit of up to $7,500 for the purchase of new qualified plug-in electric drive
           motor vehicles. In August 2022, Congress modified section 30D (“30D”) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the
           “Code”) by limiting the tax credit to electric trucks, SUVs and vans priced below $80,000 and imposing certain income
           restrictions for taxpayer eligibility to receive the 30D tax credit. Eligibility for the 30D tax credit is also contingent on (i)
           the vehicle’s final assembly occurring in North America, (ii) the vehicle having a certain percentage of the battery’s
           critical minerals originating from a United States free trade agreement partner or being recycled in North America, and
           (iii) the vehicle having a certain percentage of its battery’s components being manufactured or assembled in North
           America. Moreover, if a vehicle battery’s critical minerals were extracted, processed or recycled by a “foreign entity of
           concern,” such as China or Russia, the 30D tax credit would not apply. Congress also added a new provision to the Code
           under section 45W (“45W”) that provides an incentive of between $7,500 and $40,000 depending on the Gross Vehicle
           Weight Rating and incremental cost increase between the electric commercial vehicle and a comparable internal
           combustion engine equipped vehicle. Unlike the consumer tax credit under 30D, there are no price limits, income caps,
           manufacturing mandates or content restrictions.

            In addition to 30D and 45W, Congress also extended the Alternative Fuel Infrastructure Tax Credit under section 30C
            (“30C”) to tax credits for businesses up to 30% of the cost of installing alternative fueling equipment in eligible census
            tracts, up to $100,000. Consumers who purchased residential fueling equipment but were not eligible to depreciate such
            equipment may receive a tax credit of up to $1,000 for equipment placed in service after December 31, 2022. The
            program included electricity as an alternative fuel and potentially could be used by Rivian customers to offset the cost of
            their home charging systems and by businesses to offset the costs of installing electric vehicle charging stations.
            Additionally, if Rivian sells such equipment to a tax-exempt entity, Rivian would be eligible to claim the credit for itself.
            Unused credits may be carried backward one year and carried forward 20 years. The 30C credit was extended until
            December 31, 2032.

       •    State Incentives. A number of states and municipalities in the United States, as well as certain private enterprises, offer
            incentive programs to encourage the adoption of alternative fuel vehicles, including tax exemptions, tax credits,
            exemptions, and special privileges.

            Other states have also implemented various incentives for the purchase of eligible ZEVs based on weight class and
            propulsion type. For example, New Jersey and Washington exempt the purchase of EVs from state sales tax. California,
            Colorado, Oregon, and Oklahoma provide substantial state tax credits or rebates for the purchase of EVs. Some of these
            programs have eligibility limits based on either consumer income or the manufacturer’s suggested retail price of the
            vehicle. Others will supply rebates only until a set aside amount of funding exists. Several states will also be phasing out
            incentives over time or volume of EVs are sold. Other incentives include preferential parking at reduced rates, or free, or
            single occupancy high-occupancy vehicle access on highways for EVs.

  Intellectual Property

  Rivian’s intellectual property is a core asset of our company, and an important tool to drive value and differentiation in our
  products and services. We protect, use, and defend our intellectual property in support of our business objectives to increase our
  return on investment, enhance our competitive position, and create shareholder value. Through strategic and business
  assessments of our intellectual property, we rely on a combination of patents, trade secrets, copyrights, service marks,
  trademarks, domains, contractual terms, and enforcement mechanisms across various international jurisdictions to establish and
  protect intellectual property rights related to our current and future business and operations. While we do not believe that any
  single piece of intellectual property is individually material to the entirety of our business, our intellectual property is important
  to our operations and development of technologies.

  We will pursue intellectual property protection to the extent we believe it would be advantageous to our business objectives.
  Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights, they may not be respected in the future or may be invalidated,
  circumvented, or challenged.

  Human Capital

  As of December 31, 2022, we had 14,122 employees across North America and Europe. Our global workforce is comprised of
  engineering and technology teams that are designing and developing future products and services, our operations and go-to-
  market teams that support the production, sale, and service of our launch vehicles, and our general and administrative teams.
  Our global footprint will continue to grow as we seek diverse communities to join us on our adventure.

  As a team, we strive to Keep The World Adventurous Forever by attracting the right people in the right roles and harnessing their
  adventurous spirit. Below are our Compass principles: a set of behaviors that serve as the backbone of Rivian’s organizational
  culture. Compass serves as our guide to ensure we preserve and augment our culture through the people we attract, develop,
  and inspire.

       •    Come Together. We never take for granted the magic that occurs when thinkers and doers from different industries and
            geographies, lived experiences, and perspectives surround a challenge from all sides. So, we insist that our team
            members bring their authentic selves to work every single day. At times there will be disagreements, but that’s a good
            thing. Tension strengthens ideas. The scale of our impact rests on our ability to move quickly as one team. We challenge
            each other to deliver more as a group than we can as individuals - and get it done together. Many of our decisions
            around vehicle development were built on cross-functional discussion and debates which ultimately required coming
            together to produce the right outcome.

       •    Ask Why. Innovation isn’t the job of a small group within the Company. Better ways of doing things are waiting to be
            discovered, and it’s incumbent upon all of us to approach our work from a place of curiosity. Despite the breadth of
            objectives and the complexity of our goals, all our ideas begin the same way - from first principles. When we start with
            undeniable basic truths, it opens up a world of possibility. A first-principles approach enables us to discuss ideas rather
            than debate different sets of ideologies or dogmas from previous experiences. Every part of the Rivian customer
            experience is derived from employees continuously asking why and understanding the rationale behind every decision.

       •    Stay Open. The draw toward the unknown is strong within our team. We must continue to cultivate a willingness to
            greet uncertainty with open arms, and all the other stuff that comes along with it. Difficult questions. Unexpected turns.
            Redrawn plans. Gnawed pencils. Temple rubbing. Lots and lots of temple rubbing. When we stay open, hearts stretch,
            minds grow, new ideas surface and the impossible becomes fun. As our industry rapidly evolves, we don’t stand near
            existing anchors but instead plan ahead to imagine what this could be.

       •    Zoom Out. Look up from where you are! We’re part of not one but many interdependent ecosystems, and our actions
            have ripples across our entire organization and beyond. While it’s easy to get mired in the day-to-day, so focused on the
            task in front of us, it’s important we never lose sight of what’s at stake or why we started down this path to begin with.
            As we develop our commercial roadmaps and blueprints, each team curates their share of the Rivian customer
            experience with a keen awareness of the broader ecosystem.

       •    Over Deliver. The word forever says it all. Our work is never done and that’s by design. Loving the world means always
            looking for more ways to do better. We don’t stop at good enough. In order to create the change we seek, we go beyond
            what is expected of us - respond to the problems of today while intentionally laying the groundwork for a better
            tomorrow. Multiple product launches and cutting-edge development across domains - over delivery on expectations is a
            core tenet of our strategy.




                                                                    10

  Our Commitment to Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Belonging

  At Rivian, we believe that forever is for EVERYONE and this philosophy is symbiotic with our mission to Keep the World
  Adventurous Forever. Belonging is the outcome of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion. It is a cultural imperative, is intentionally woven
  in all we do, and is a key driver of our values. Belonging is about building cultures, celebrating each other, and fostering
  communities where we feel a deep sense of connectedness, like we are a part of the larger whole and can thrive in those spaces.

  Below are our Operating Principles that anchor all of our work for Belonging:

       •    Representation Matters. There is undeniable power in representation and attracting, hiring, and retaining diverse talent
            at all levels is key.

       •    Diverse Teams are Better Teams. They bring broader perspective and experiences that enable us to innovate and solve
            big problems.

       •    Self-Awareness is the Gateway to Learning. Being the bridge to a new way of thinking and working together starts with
            us as individuals.

       •    Embedding Equitable Practices is Key. Equity is intentionally built into our broader people and talent processes with
            clear accountabilities for our leaders.

  To support, facilitate, and drive towards the goal of Belonging for all, Rivian continues to develop a full range of internal programs
  and offerings for our employees. This includes internal mobility, career development, strategic hiring programs, commitments to
  inclusion through allyship, and learning and development initiatives. In addition, we offer Belonging Resource Groups and other
  networks which facilitate the opportunity for our communities to come together in conversation, education, moments of
  celebration, and in times of change. All are welcome.

  Our Climate Commitment
  Responding effectively to climate change requires collective action and urgency. We believe we have a responsibility and
  opportunity to play a role in the global economic transition to net zero emissions. We are one of the signatories to The Climate
  Pledge, through which signatories commit to reaching net-zero carbon emissions by 2040. We aim to:

       •    measure and report our GHG emissions;
       •    implement decarbonization strategies in line with The Climate Pledge through real business change and innovations,
            including energy efficiency improvements, renewable energy use, designing for circularity of materials, and other carbon
            abatement strategies; and
       •    power charging on the Rivian Adventure Network and Rivian Waypoints Network with 100% renewable energy, which
            may be achieved by a variety of mechanisms, including, but not limited to, power purchase agreements and the
            purchase of renewable energy credits.

  Our climate commitment is backed by our current focus on applying sustainable practices across several facets of our business:

       •    Product Development. Rivian’s products are being designed to reduce impact on the environment over their life cycle.
            This includes looking to incorporate sustainable materials versus conventional, prioritizing energy efficiency, and
            recycling key materials. We are integrating recycled content, material utilization, and other sustainability metrics directly
            into the product requirements so impact can be reduced at the earliest stages of design. Advanced diagnostics allow us
            to identify areas to optimize battery and overall vehicle health which may increase the use phase of our vehicles. We
            also track and forecast the carbon footprint of design iterations throughout the product development process to provide
            teams with the ability to integrate sustainability into daily decision-making.

       •    Operations. Like any company, we use resources to operate. Our goal is to do so efficiently and thoughtfully at our
            existing facilities and new facilities as we grow and scale our business. Our team is dedicated to measuring our GHG
            emissions and decarbonizing our operations. Where possible, we utilize energy management systems, purchase recycled
            and reusable packaging materials, and actively utilize rail across our distribution channels to reduce our




                                                                    11

            logistics related carbon footprint. Rivian is pursuing a high performance, energy efficient central thermal building for our
            future production facility, which will provide higher quality and better operational performance over the life of the
            system than comparable options. Rivian evaluates operational design decisions through a lens of total cost of ownership
            to highlight the long-term value of energy reduction strategies for the business. As we expand production capacity at our
            Normal Factory and build new sites to support our growth, we intend that environmental impact will be a significant
            factor in our planning. We are making progress on powering our charging network and production facilities with
            renewable energy.

  Forever: Philanthropic Activities and Corporate Giving

  At Rivian, we believe sustainable and inclusive business is vital to society, the environment, and humanity’s continued prosperity.
  Our philanthropic mission is focused on helping to Keep the World Adventurous Forever by preserving the planet for future
  generations. Through a non-operating private foundation currently seeking 501(c)(3) designation (the “Rivian Foundation”),
  Forever by Rivian, Inc., a 501(c)(4) social welfare organization (“Forever by Rivian”), and efforts by Rivian directly (collectively,
  “Forever”), we intend to expand our impact beyond the transportation and energy products and services we make and the
  associated competition they inspire. We aim for Forever to go further to address climate change and to help preserve the critical
  biodiversity needed for our planet’s long term survival.

  Item 1A. Risk Factors

  Our business is subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those described below, that may cause actual results to differ
  materially from historical performance or projected future performance expressed in forward-looking statements made by us. We
  encourage you to consider carefully the risk factors described below in evaluating the information in this Form 10-K as the

  operations, and cash flows as well as on our reputation, business, growth, future prospects, and ability to accomplish our strategic
  objectives.

  Risks Related to Our Business

  We are a growth stage company with limited operating history and a history of losses and expect to incur significant expenses
  and continuing losses for the foreseeable future. We may underestimate or not effectively manage the capital expenditures
  and costs associated with our business and operations, which could have a material and adverse effect on

  our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. We may also require additional financing to
  support our business, which may not be available in a timely manner or on terms that are acceptable, or at all.

  We have incurred net losses since our inception, including net losses of $1.0 billion, $4.7 billion, and $6.8 billion for the years
  ended December 31, 2020, 2021 and 2022, respectively. Our costs will continue to be significant in the foreseeable future as we
  grow our go-to-market operations and sales of our vehicles, scale our operations, identify and commit resources to consider and
  address new areas of demand, including new geographies, and incur costs from operating as a public company. These
  expenditures include production costs, such as raw materials, labor and logistics costs, research and development investments
  and expenses, sales and distribution expenses, costs in connection with expanding our charging networks, and general and
  administrative expenses, and our level of expenditures will be significantly affected by consumer demand for our current
  products and services along with anticipated demand for future products and services. We do not expect to be profitable for the
  foreseeable future as we invest in our business, build capacity, and ramp up operations, and there is no assurance that we will
  ever achieve or be able to maintain profitability in the future. Our ability to become profitable in the future will depend on the
  continued successful development and commercial production and acceptance of our vehicles and services, our ability to
  maintain strong demand and average selling prices for our vehicles, as well as our capability to manufacture our vehicle portfolio
  efficiently and estimate and effectively manage both our operating expenditures and our capital expenditures. If we are unable to
  efficiently manage our costs, our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows would be
  materially and adversely affected.

  As we have transitioned from an early-stage company focused on research and development activities to the large-scale
  manufacture, sale, and support of vehicles, we have required and expect to continue to require significant capital to develop and
  grow our business, including developing our vehicles to be manufactured at volume, rolling out our go-to-market infrastructure as
  well as building our brand and investing in our next generation technologies and products. Our future capital requirements are
  subject to uncertainty, particularly since we have a limited operating history as well as limited historical data on the demand for
  our products and services and the costs that we will incur over time in delivering these products and services to our customers. In
  addition, we have limited insight into trends that may emerge and affect our business as we operate in a relatively new industry
  segment that is rapidly evolving and highly competitive. As a result, actual capital requirements may be different from or greater
  than those we currently anticipate.

  We expect that we will need to seek additional equity or debt financing in both the near- and long-term to finance a portion of
  our costs and capital expenditures. Our ability to obtain the necessary financing to carry out our business plan is subject to a
  number of factors. These include general conditions in the global economy and financial markets, which continue to experience
  volatility and disruptions as a result of inflation and interest rate changes, investor and customer acceptance of our business
  model, and market confidence in our ability to execute against our business plans. These factors may make the timing, amount,
  terms and conditions of such financing unattractive or unavailable to us. Any additional indebtedness we incur would result in
  increased debt service obligations and could involve additional restrictive covenants relating to our capital raising activities and
  other financial and operational matters, and the sale of additional equity or equity-linked securities would result in dilution for
  our stockholders. If we are unable to raise sufficient funds or obtain funding on terms satisfactory to us, we may have to
  significantly reduce our spending, delay or cancel our planned activities or substantially change our corporate structure, and we
  may not have sufficient resources to conduct our business as projected. This could mean that we would be forced to curtail or
  discontinue our operations, which could materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition, results of
  operations, and cash flows.

  Our ability to develop and manufacture vehicles of sufficient quality and appeal to customers on schedule and on a large scale
  is unproven, and we have experienced, and may in the future experience, significant delays in the manufacture and delivery of
  our vehicles, which could harm our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.

  Our business depends in large part on our ability to develop, manufacture, obtain regulatory approval for, market, and sell
  vehicles of sufficient quality and appeal to customers on schedule and on a large scale. Our vehicles may not meet customer
  expectations and may not be commercially viable. Our initial deliveries for the R1T and R1S were delayed, and our production
  ramp is taking longer than originally expected as a result of operational and supply chain challenges in addition to other related
  factors. In addition, the cascading impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and the ongoing military conflict between Russia and the
  Ukraine impacted our business and operations from facility construction to equipment installation and vehicle component supply.
  Any further delay in the manufacture or delivery of our vehicles could materially damage our brand, business, prospects, financial
  condition, results of operations, and cash flows, and could cause liquidity constraints.

  We launched our first consumer vehicles, the R1T and R1S, and first commercial vehicle, the EDV, and made our first deliveries in
  2021. In conjunction with the launch of future products we may need to manufacture our vehicles in increasingly higher volumes
  than our present production capabilities at the Normal Factory. We have limited experience as an organization in high volume
  manufacturing of EVs, and there is no certainty as to when we will reach full vehicle production rate capacity at the Normal
  Factory. Even if we are successful in developing our high-volume manufacturing capability and processes and in reliably sourcing
  our component supply, we cannot assure that we will be able to do so in a manner that avoids significant delays and cost
  overruns. The continued development of and the ability to manufacture our vehicles at scale, including the R1T, R1S, and
  commercial fleet vehicles, such as the EDV, and other commercial products are and will be subject to risks, including with respect
  to:

       •    securing in a timely manner necessary raw materials, supplies, and components that meet our quality standards;
       •     our ability to negotiate and execute definitive licenses and agreements, and maintain arrangements on reasonable
            terms, with our various suppliers for hardware, software, or services necessary to engineer or manufacture components
            of our vehicles;
       •    quality controls, including within our manufacturing operations, that prove to be ineffective or inefficient and so drive
            higher than expected warranty or other costs;
       •    our ability to accurately forecast, purchase, warehouse, and transport components at high volumes to our
            manufacturing facility;
       •    our ability to successfully implement automation, inventory management and other systems to accommodate the
            increased complexity in our supply chain and components management, which may result in unexpected production
            disruption, storage, transportation and write-off costs;
       •    defects in design and/or manufacture that cause our vehicles not to perform as expected or that require repair, field
            actions, including product recalls, and design changes;
       •    delays, disruptions or increased costs in our supply chain, including raw material supplies;
       •    scaling our production processes to reduce the number of labor hours required to manufacture each vehicle;
       •    other delays, backlog in manufacturing and research and development of new models, and cost overruns;
       •    obtaining required regulatory approvals and certifications;
       •    compliance with environmental, health, safety, and similar regulations;
       •    our ability to attract, recruit, hire, retain, and train skilled employees; and
       •    our ability to expand operations at existing facilities or future facilities, including plans to construct and operationalize a
            second manufacturing plant.

  Historically, automobile customers have expected car manufacturers to periodically introduce new and improved vehicle models.
  In order to meet these expectations, we may be required to introduce new vehicle models and enhanced versions of existing
  models. Given that for the foreseeable future our business will depend on a limited number of models and that we have limited
  experience, as a company, designing, testing, manufacturing, marketing, selling, and supporting/servicing our vehicles, there can
  be no assurance that we will be able to meet customer expectations.

  Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations,
  and cash flows.

  We have experienced, and could experience in the future, cost increases and disruptions in supply of raw materials or other
  components used in our vehicles.

  We incur significant costs related to procuring raw materials required to manufacture and assemble our vehicles. The prices we
  pay for these raw materials fluctuate depending on factors often beyond our control, including market conditions, inflation,
  changes in interest rates, and global demand for these materials, and could adversely affect our business, prospects, financial
  condition, results of operations, and cash flows. There have been very sizable increases in recent months in the cost of key
  metals, including lithium, nickel, aluminum, and cobalt with volatility in pricing expected to persist for the foreseeable future.

  Furthermore, currency fluctuations, tariffs or shortages in petroleum and other economic or political conditions may result in
  significant increases in freight charges and raw material and component costs. Substantial increases in the prices for our raw
  materials or components would increase our operating costs and could reduce our margins. For example, due to the global
  semiconductor supply shortage, other supply chain issues including the COVID-19 pandemic and the ongoing military conflict
  between Russia and the Ukraine, and the current inflationary environment, the cost of raw materials and components required to
  produce our vehicles has risen considerably, and we have increased, and may need to continue to increase, the

  prices of our vehicles in response to these and future cost pressures. Price increases and other measures taken by us to offset
  higher costs could materially and adversely affect our reputation and brand, result in negative publicity and loss of customers and
  sales, and adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.

  Changes in business or macroeconomic conditions, governmental regulations, and other factors beyond our control or that we do
  not presently anticipate could affect our ability to receive components from our suppliers. For example, impacts from COVID-19,
  including associated variants, including recent outbreaks in China that led the government to impose lockdowns and other
  restrictions, and the ongoing military conflict between Russia and the Ukraine, have caused disruptions to and delays in our
  operations. These include shortages and delays in the supply of certain parts, including semiconductors, materials and equipment
  necessary for the production of our vehicles, and the various internal designs and processes we have adopted in an effort to
  remedy or mitigate impacts of such disruptions and delays have resulted in higher costs. Also, if a supplied vehicle component
  becomes the subject of a field action, including a product recall, we may be required to find an alternative component, which
  could increase our costs, cause vehicle production delays and subject us to costly litigation surrounding the component. In
  addition, if our suppliers experience substantial financial difficulties, cease operations, or otherwise face business disruptions, or
  choose to de-prioritize their supply to us, we would be required to take measures to ensure components and materials remain
  available. There are also increasing expectations that companies monitor the environmental and/or social performance of their
  supply chains, including suppliers’ compliance with a variety of labor practices. Compliance can be costly, require us to establish
  or augment programs to diligence or monitor our suppliers, or, in the case of legislation such as the Uyghur Forced Labor
  Prevention Act, to design supply chains to avoid certain regions or suppliers altogether. Failure to comply may result in a variety
  of adverse impacts, including reputational damage, potential liability, or a denial of import for various components. In some cases
  we may not be able to find alternative suppliers on acceptable terms or for the quantities that we need. The unavailability of any
  component or supplier has resulted, and could in the future result in production delays, idle manufacturing facilities, product
  design changes, loss of access to important technology and tools for producing and supporting our products and services, and
  increased costs, any of which could increase our costs and negatively affect our business, prospects, financial condition, results of
  operations, and cash flows.

  As a key component of our vehicle products, our business depends on the continued supply of battery cells for our vehicles and
  the inability or unwillingness of battery cell manufacturers to build or operate battery cell manufacturing plants to supply the
  numbers of battery cells (including the applicable chemistries) required to support the growth of the electric or plug-in hybrid
  vehicle industry as demand for such cells increases would impact our projected manufacturing and delivery timelines, and
  adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.

  We are dependent on our existing suppliers, a significant number of which are single or limited source suppliers, and are also
  dependent on our ability to source suppliers, for our critical components, and to complete the building out of our supply chain,
  while effectively managing the risks due to such relationships.

  Our success will be dependent upon our ability to enter into supplier agreements and maintain our relationships with existing
  suppliers who are critical and necessary to the production of our vehicles. The supply agreements we have, and may enter into
  with suppliers in the future, may have provisions where such agreements can be terminated in various circumstances, including
  potentially without cause. In the ordinary course of our business, we currently have, and may in the future have, legal disputes
  with our suppliers, including litigation to enforce such supply agreements, which would adversely affect our ability to source
  components from such suppliers. If our suppliers become unable or unwilling to provide, or experience delays in providing,
  components, or if the supply agreements we have in place are terminated, or if any such litigation to enforce our supply
  agreements is not resolved in our favor, it may be difficult or impossible to find replacement components at a reasonable cost in a
  timely manner.

  Additionally, our products contain thousands of components that we purchase from hundreds of mostly single- or limited-source
  suppliers, for which no immediate or readily available alternative supplier exists. Due to scarce natural resources or other
  component availability constraints, we may not receive the full allocation of components we have requested from a particular
  supplier due to supplier allocation decisions that are outside our control. While we believe that we would be able to establish
  alternate supply relationships and can obtain or engineer replacement components for our single source components, we may be
  unable to do so in the short term (or at all) at prices or quality levels that are acceptable to us. Further, any such alternative
  suppliers may be located a long distance from the Normal Factory, which may lead to increased costs or delays. In addition, as we
  evaluate opportunities and take steps to insource certain components, supply arrangements with current or future suppliers
  (with respect to other components offered by such suppliers) may be available on less favorable terms or not at all.

  In addition, we are required to provide forecasts of our demand to our suppliers several months prior to the scheduled delivery of
  products to our prospective customers. Currently, there is limited historical basis for making judgments on the demand for our
  vehicles, our ability to develop, manufacture, and deliver vehicles, or our results of operations in the future. If we overestimate
  our requirements, our suppliers may have excess inventory, which would indirectly increase our costs. If we underestimate our
  requirements, our suppliers may have inadequate inventory, which could interrupt manufacturing of our products and result in
  delays in shipments and revenues. In addition, lead times for materials and components that our suppliers order may vary
  significantly and depend on factors such as the specific supplier, contract terms and demand for each component at a given time.
  If we fail to order sufficient quantities of product components in a timely manner, the delivery of vehicles to our customers could
  be delayed, which could materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations, and
  cash flows.

  If we do not enter into long-term supply agreements with guaranteed pricing for our components, or if those long-term supply
  agreements are not honored by our suppliers, we may be exposed to fluctuations in prices of components, materials, and
  equipment. Agreements for the purchase of battery cells contain or are likely to contain pricing provisions that are subject to
  adjustments based on changes in market prices of key commodities. Substantial increases in the prices for components,
  materials, and equipment would increase our operating costs and could reduce our margins if we cannot recoup the increased
  costs. Increasing the announced or expected prices of our vehicles in response to increased costs has previously been viewed
  negatively by our potential customers, and any future attempts to increase prices could have similar results, which could
  adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.

  We depend upon third parties to manufacture and to supply key semiconductor chip components necessary for our vehicles.
  We do not have long-term agreements with all of our semiconductor chip manufacturers and suppliers, and if these
  manufacturers or suppliers become unwilling or unable to provide an adequate supply of semiconductor chips, with respect to
  which there is a global shortage, we would not be able to find alternative sources in a timely manner and our business would
  be adversely impacted.

  Semiconductor chips are a vital input component to the electrical architecture of our consumer and commercial vehicles,
  controlling multiple aspects of the vehicles’ operations. Many of the key semiconductor chips used in our vehicles come from
  limited or single sources of supply, and therefore a disruption with any one manufacturer or supplier in our supply chain would
  have an adverse effect on our ability to effectively manufacture and timely deliver our vehicles. Due to our reliance on these
  semiconductor chips, we are subject to the risk of shortages and long lead times in their supply. We are still in the process of
  identifying alternative manufacturers for semiconductor chips. We have in the past experienced, are currently experiencing, and
  may in the future experience, semiconductor chip shortages, and the availability and cost of these components would be difficult
  to predict. For example, our manufacturers may experience temporary or permanent disruptions in their manufacturing
  operations due to equipment breakdowns, labor strikes or shortages, natural disasters, including as a result of climate change,
  global pandemics, component or material shortages, cost increases, acquisitions, insolvency, changes in legal or regulatory
  requirements, or other similar problems.

  In particular, increased demand for semiconductor chips in 2020, due in part to the COVID-19 pandemic and increased demand
  for consumer electronics that use these chips, resulted in a severe global shortage of chips in 2021, which continued in 2022 and
  we expect will continue in 2023, in part as a consequence of the continuing COVID-19 pandemic and the ongoing military conflict
  between Russia and the Ukraine. As a result, our ability to source semiconductor chips used in our vehicles was adversely
  affected. This shortage resulted and will likely continue to result in increased chip delivery lead times, delays in the production of
  our vehicles, and increased costs to source available semiconductor chips. To the extent this semiconductor chip shortage
  continues, and we are unable to mitigate the effects of this shortage, our ability to deliver sufficient quantities of our vehicles to
  fulfill our preorders and to support our growth through sales to new customers would be adversely affected. In addition, we
  expect to incur additional costs and expenses in managing ongoing chip shortages, including additional research and
  development expenses, engineering design and development costs in the event that new suppliers must be onboarded on an
  expedited basis. Further, ongoing delays in production and shipment of vehicles due to a continuing shortage of semiconductor
  chips may harm our reputation and discourage additional preorders and vehicle sales, and otherwise materially and adversely
  affect our business and operations.

  We expect that a significant portion of our near-term revenue will be from one customer that is an affiliate of one of our
  principal stockholders. If we are unable to maintain this relationship or if this customer purchases significantly fewer vehicles
  than we currently anticipate, then our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows could be
  materially and adversely affected.

  In the near-term, we expect that a significant portion of our revenue will be from Amazon Logistics, Inc. (“Logistics”). Amazon is
  the parent company of both Logistics and Amazon.com NV Investment Holdings LLC (“NV Holdings”), which beneficially owns
  shares of our capital stock (including shares issuable upon the exercise of a warrant to purchase 3,723,050 shares of Class A
  common stock, as amended) representing 16.2% of our voting power as of December 31, 2022.

  In February 2019, we entered into a commercial letter agreement with Amazon, and in September 2019, we entered into a
  related framework agreement with Logistics. We refer to these agreements, together with any work orders, purchase orders,
  related agreements, and amendments thereunder or thereto, collectively, as the “EDV Agreement.” Under the EDV Agreement,
  we and Logistics have agreed to collaborate to design, develop, manufacture, and supply EDVs and/or certain component parts
  and related services for use in Amazon’s last mile delivery operations. We also have agreed under the EDV Agreement that until
  the fourth anniversary of when Logistics first receives EDVs (the “Initial Delivery Date”), we will exclusively provide last mile
  delivery vehicles to Amazon, and from the fourth anniversary to the sixth anniversary of the Initial Delivery Date, Amazon will
  have a right of first refusal to purchase last mile delivery vehicles that we produce. Under the EDV Agreement, Logistics has the
  right to decide how many EDVs to purchase, which may be fewer than expected, or delay the delivery of such purchases. Certain
  factors outside of our control may influence Logistics’ decision as to the number of EDVs to purchase from us and the timing of
  delivery, including Logistics’ ability to deploy a charging infrastructure across their delivery stations. The EDV Agreement is non-
  exclusive for Logistics, and Logistics has purchased and may continue to purchase EVs, including last mile delivery vehicles, from
  other manufacturers, including those who are or may become competitors to us.

  While the EDV Agreement provides that we will be reimbursed for certain development costs, it does not include any minimum
  purchase requirements or otherwise restrict Logistics from developing vehicles or collaborating with, or purchasing similar
  vehicles from, third parties. The EDV Agreement may be terminated by either party with or without cause, subject to compliance
  with certain termination provisions. If we fail to adequately perform under the EDV Agreement, if fewer EDVs are purchased than
  we anticipate, or if either party terminates the EDV Agreement for any reason, our business, prospects, financial condition,
  results of operations, or cash flows would be materially and adversely affected.

  The success of our business depends on attracting and retaining a large number of customers. If we are unable to do so, we
  will not be able to achieve profitability.

  Our success depends on attracting a large number of potential customers to purchase our vehicles and the associated services we
  provide and may in the future provide to our customers. We offer our customers the ability to make preorders in the United
  States and Canada with a cancellable and fully refundable deposit of $1,000, except for those consumers who opted into a
  binding purchase agreement on or after August 10, 2022 and before the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the “IRA”) was enacted,
  for whom only a portion is refundable. Deposits paid to preorder the R1T and R1S are cancellable by the customer until the
  customer enters into a lease or purchase agreement. The potentially long wait from the time a preorder is made until the time
  the vehicle is delivered, any delays beyond expected wait times, and any changes in available configurations could also impact
  consumer decisions on whether to ultimately make a purchase or cancel a preorder. Because all of our preorders are cancellable,
  it is possible that a significant number of customers who submitted preorders for our vehicles may not purchase vehicles. Any
  cancellations could materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations, and cash
  flows.

  If our existing preorder and prospective customers do not perceive our vehicles and services to be of sufficiently high value and
  quality, cost competitive and appealing in aesthetics or performance, we may not be able to retain our current preorder
  customers or attract new customers, and our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows would
  be materially and adversely affected. In addition, we may incur significantly higher and more sustained marketing and
  promotional expenditures than we have previously incurred to attract customers. Further, our future success will also depend in
  part on securing additional commercial agreements with businesses and/or fleet operators for our commercial vehicles. If, for any
  of these reasons, we are not able to attract and maintain consumer and commercial customers, our business, prospects, financial
  condition, results of operations, or cash flows would be materially and adversely affected.

  The automotive market is highly competitive, and we may not be successful in competing in this industry.

  Both the automobile industry generally, and the EV segment in particular, are highly competitive, and we are competing for sales
  with both EV manufacturers and traditional automotive companies, including those who have or have announced consumer and
  commercial vehicles that may be directly competitive to ours. Many of our current and potential competitors may have
  significantly greater financial, technical, manufacturing, marketing, or other resources than we do and may be able to devote
  greater resources to the design, development, manufacturing, distribution, promotion, sale, and support of their products than
  we may devote to our products. We expect competition for EVs to intensify due to increased demand and a regulatory push for
  alternative fuel vehicles, continuing globalization, and consolidation in the worldwide automotive industry, as well as the
  significant volatility in oil and gasoline prices. In addition, as fleet operators begin transitioning to EVs on a mass scale, we expect
  that more competitors will enter the commercial fleet EV market. Under the EDV Agreement, we have granted Amazon certain
  exclusivity and first refusal rights which will initially restrict our ability to contract with other commercial customers. See “—We
  expect that a significant portion of our near-term revenue will be from one customer that is an affiliate of one of our principal
  stockholders. If we are unable to maintain this relationship or if this customer purchases significantly fewer vehicles than we
  currently anticipate, then our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows could be materially
  and adversely affected.” In addition, the existence of our commercial relationship with Amazon, coupled with its significant
  holdings of our securities, may deter Amazon’s competitors or other third parties from contracting with us. Further, as a result of
  new entrants in the commercial fleet EV market, we may experience increased competition for components and other parts of
  our vehicles, which may have limited or single-source supply.

  Factors affecting competition include product performance and quality, technological innovation, customer experience, brand
  differentiation, product design, pricing and TCO, and manufacturing scale and efficiency. The EV sector has recently experienced
  increasing price competition due in part to general economic conditions, including a rise in interest rates for vehicle loans. Several
  of our competitors have recently announced changes in pricing strategy, including vehicle price reductions, which may result in
  downward price pressure. We may not have the financial resources of some of our competitors to allow us to adjust pricing
  strategies, which may result in lower vehicle unit sales and increased inventory, a loss of customers and a loss in future market
  share, any of which could adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.

  We are highly dependent on the services and reputation of Robert J. Scaringe, our Founder and CEO.

  We are highly dependent on the services and reputation of Robert J. Scaringe, our Founder and CEO. Dr. Scaringe is a significant
  influence on and driver of our business plan. If Dr. Scaringe were to discontinue his service due to death, disability or any other
  reason, or if his reputation is adversely impacted by personal actions or omissions or other events within or outside his control,
  we would be significantly disadvantaged.

  In addition, Dr. Scaringe is a director of Forever by Rivian and a director and the President of the Rivian Foundation. Such
  positions with the Rivian Foundation and Forever by Rivian may give rise to fiduciary or other duties in conflict with the duties he
  owes to us. Furthermore, Dr. Scaringe may have significant duties, and may devote a substantial amount of time serving, as a
  member of the board of directors of the Rivian Foundation and Forever by Rivian which may compete with his ability to devote a
  sufficient amount of attention toward his obligations to us, or to day-to-day activities of our business.

  Our long-term results depend upon our ability to successfully introduce, integrate, and market new products and services,
  which may expose us to new and increased challenges and risks, and any inability to do so could materially and adversely
  affect our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.

  Our growth strategy depends, in part, on our ability to successfully introduce and market new products and services, such as
  financing, insurance, vehicle services, charging solutions, vehicle resale, as well as membership and software services for
  consumer customers and fleet management for commercial customers. If we experience significant future growth, we may be
  required not only to make additional investments in our ecosystem and workforce, but also to expand our distribution
  infrastructure and customer support or expand our relationships with various partners and other third parties with whom we do
  business.

  As we introduce new products and services or refine, improve, begin charging customers for, or upgrade versions of existing
  products and services, we cannot predict the level of market acceptance or the amount of market share these products or
  services will achieve, if any. There can be no assurance that we will not experience material delays in the introduction of new

  continue to use a substantial amount of capital for product refinement, research and development, and sales and marketing. We

  us, if at all, which could adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.

  To date, we have no sustained experience servicing or repairing our vehicles in the field or providing financing or insurance
  services for our vehicles. Such lack of sustained experience as well as our lack of significant, relevant user data relating to these
  new offerings may make it more difficult for us to anticipate user demand and preferences. We may misjudge user demand and
  the potential profitability of a new product or service.

  If we fail to scale our business operations or otherwise manage our future growth effectively as we attempt to rapidly grow
  our company, we may not be able to produce, market, service and sell (or lease) our vehicles successfully.

  We intend to continue to expand our operations significantly, which will require hiring, retaining and training new personnel,
  controlling expenses, efficiently and effectively expanding operational capabilities, establishing more facilities and experience
  centers, and growing administrative infrastructure, systems, and processes. For example, in order to efficiently and effectively
  operate our manufacturing processes we must stand-up complex and integrated information technology (“IT”) systems, and we
  plan to strategically expand infrastructure, including additional manufacturing capacity both domestically and internationally. Our
  future operating results depend to a large extent on our ability to manage this expansion and growth successfully. Risks that we
  face in undertaking this expansion include, among others:

       •    attracting and hiring skilled and qualified personnel to support our expanded operations at existing facilities or
            operations at any facilities we may construct or acquire in the future;
       •    constructing and operationalizing our planned second manufacturing plant;
       •    implementing IT systems that allow for efficiently scalable manufacturing operations;
       •    managing a larger organization with a greater number of employees in different divisions and geographies;
       •    training and integrating new employees into our operations to meet the growing demands of our business;
       •    controlling expenses and investments in anticipation of expanded operations;
       •    establishing or expanding design, manufacturing, sales, charging and service facilities;
       •    managing regulatory requirements and permits, labor issues and controlling costs in connection with the construction of
            additional facilities or the expansion of existing facilities;
       •    implementing and enhancing administrative infrastructure, systems and processes;
       •    facing opposition from local anti-development groups or other special interest groups that are adverse to our business
            interests;
       •    failing to receive or maintain the support of local, state, federal or international politicians or other policymakers
            necessary to support expansion or new construction plans; and
       •    addressing any new markets and potentially unforeseen challenges as they arise.

  As a newer entrant into the automotive industry, we cannot assure that we will be able to develop efficient, automated, cost-
  efficient manufacturing capabilities and processes, and reliable sources of component supply, that will enable us to meet the
  quality, price, engineering, design, and production standards, as well as the production volumes, required to successfully market
  our vehicles as our operations expand. Any failure to effectively manage our growth could materially and adversely affect our
  business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.

  We may not succeed in maintaining and strengthening our brand, which would materially and adversely affect customer
  acceptance of our vehicles, products, and services and our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations, or
  cash flows.

  Our business and prospects heavily depend on our ability to maintain and strengthen the Rivian brand. If we are not able to
  maintain and strengthen our brand, we may lose the opportunity to build a critical mass of customers. Our ability to maintain and
  strengthen the Rivian brand will depend heavily on our ability to provide high quality EVs and engage with our customers as
  intended, as well as the success of our customer development and marketing efforts.

  The automobile industry is intensely competitive. Many of our current and potential competitors, particularly automobile
  manufacturers headquartered in the United States, Japan, the EU, and China, have greater name recognition, broader

  customer relationships, and substantially greater marketing resources than we do. If we do not maintain a strong brand, our
  business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations, and/or cash flows could be materially and adversely impacted.

  In addition, if incidents occur or are perceived to have occurred, such as production delays and price increases, whether or not
  such incidents are our fault, we have in the past and could in the future be subject to adverse publicity. In particular, given the
  popularity of social media, any negative publicity, whether true or not, could quickly proliferate and harm consumer perceptions
  and confidence in the Rivian brand. Furthermore, there is the risk of potential adverse publicity related to our manufacturing,
  other partners (whether or not such publicity is related to their collaboration with us) or investors. Our ability to successfully
  position our brand could also be adversely affected by perceptions about the quality of our competitors’ vehicles. In addition,
  from time to time, our vehicles are evaluated and reviewed by third parties. Any negative reviews or reviews which compare us
  unfavorably to competitors could adversely affect consumer perception about our vehicles.

  Our passion and focus on delivering a high-quality and engaging Rivian experience may not maximize short-term financial
  results, which may yield results that conflict with the market’s expectations and could result in our stock price being negatively
  affected.

  We are passionate about continually enhancing the Rivian experience with a focus on driving long-term customer engagement
  through innovative, technologically advanced vehicles and services, which may not necessarily maximize short-term financial
  results. We frequently make business decisions that may reduce our short-term financial results if we believe that the decisions
  are consistent with our goals to improve the Rivian experience, which we believe will improve our financial results over the long-
  term. In the near-term, we will focus significant resources on research and development and sales and marketing to deliver the
  Rivian experience to our customers, which could impact our short-term financial results. These decisions may not be consistent
  with the short-term expectations of our stockholders and may not produce the long-term benefits that we expect, in which case
  our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows could be materially and adversely impacted.

  Our distribution model is different from the predominant current distribution model for automobile manufacturers and is
  subject to regulatory limitations on our ability to sell and service vehicles directly, which subjects us to substantial risk and
  makes evaluating our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows difficult.

  We are selling and financing, and plan to lease, our vehicles directly to customers rather than through franchised dealerships. This
  model of vehicle distribution is relatively new, different from the predominant current distribution model for automobile
  manufacturers and, with limited exceptions, unproven, which subjects us to substantial risk. We have limited experience in selling
  and no experience in leasing vehicles and therefore this model may require significant expenditures and provide for slower
  expansion than the traditional dealer franchise system. For example, we will not be able to utilize long established sales channels
  developed through a franchise system to increase sales volume. Moreover, we will be competing with companies with well
  established distribution channels. Our success will depend in large part on our ability to effectively develop our own sales
  channels and marketing strategies. If our direct sales and leasing model does not develop as expected, develops more slowly than
  expected, or faces significant adversity from the established industry, we may be required to modify or abandon our sales and
  leasing model, which could materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations, and
  cash flows.

  As a manufacturer engaged in sales directly to consumers, we may also face regulatory limitations on our ability to sell and
  service vehicles directly, which could materially and adversely affect our ability to sell our vehicles. Many states have laws that
  may be interpreted to impose limitations on this direct-to-consumer sales model for manufacturers. The application of these
  state laws to our operations may be difficult to predict. Laws in some states may limit our ability to obtain dealer licenses from
  state motor vehicle regulators or to own or operate our own service centers. As a result, we may not be able to sell, finance or
  lease directly to customers in each state in the United States or provide service from a location in every state. In addition,
  decisions by regulators permitting us to sell vehicles may be challenged by dealer associations and others as to whether such
  decisions comply with applicable state motor vehicle industry laws. In some states, there have also been regulatory and legislative
  efforts by dealer associations to interpret laws or propose laws that, if enacted, would prevent us from obtaining dealer licenses
  in their states given our direct sales model. Dealer associations have also resorted to lawsuits in state courts to challenge our
  ability to obtain dealer licenses and operate directly even in states that have laws that would otherwise allow us to own and
  operate retail locations. We expect dealer associations to continue to mount continued legal and legislative challenges to our
  business model. For customers residing in states in which we will not be allowed to sell, lease, or deliver vehicles, we must
  generally conduct the sale out of the state over the internet or telephonically and may have to arrange alternate methods of
  delivery of vehicles. This could include delivering vehicles to adjacent or nearby states

  in which we are allowed to directly sell or lease and ship vehicles, and arranging for the customer to transport the vehicles to
  their home states. These workarounds could add significant complexity, and as a result, costs, to our business. States may also
  restrict our ability to service vehicles once sold and delivered to customers. Some states, for example, have laws that prohibit
  manufacturers from providing warranty service in state or restrict the ability for manufacturers to own or operate service
  operations. A few states have passed legislation that clarifies our ability to operate, but at the same time limits the number of
  dealer licenses we can obtain or dealerships that we can operate.The foregoing examples of state laws governing the sale and
  servicing of motor vehicles are just some of the legal hurdles we face as we sell and service our vehicles. In many states, there is
  limited historical application of motor vehicle laws to our sales model, particularly with respect to the sale of new vehicles over
  the internet. Internationally, there may be laws in jurisdictions that may restrict our sales or other business practices. While we
  have analyzed the principal laws in the United States, Canada, EU, China, Japan, U.K., and Australia relating to our distribution
  model and believe we comply with such laws, the laws in this area can be complex, difficult to interpret and may change over
  time, and thus require ongoing review. Further, we have not performed a complete analysis of all jurisdictions in which we may
  sell vehicles. These uncertainties and complexities subject us to substantial risk and could materially and adversely affect our
  business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.

  We rely on complex machinery for our operations, and production involves a significant degree of risk and uncertainty in terms
  of operational performance, safety, security, and costs.

  We rely heavily on complex machinery for our operations and our production involves a significant degree of uncertainty and risk
  in terms of operational performance, safety, security, and costs. Our manufacturing plant consists of large-scale machinery
  combining many components, including complex software to operate such machinery and to coordinate operating activities
  across the manufacturing plant. The manufacturing plant components are likely to suffer unexpected malfunctions from time to
  time, especially as we ramp up production on new products, and will depend on repairs, spare parts, and IT solutions to resume
  operations, which may not be available when needed. Unexpected malfunctions of the manufacturing plant machinery may
  significantly affect operational efficiency.

  Operational performance and costs can be difficult to predict and are often influenced by factors outside of our control, such as,
  but not limited to, scarcity of natural resources, environmental hazards and remediation, costs associated with decommissioning
  of machines, labor disputes and strikes, difficulty or delays in obtaining governmental permits, damages or defects in electronic
  systems including the software used to control or operate them, industrial accidents, pandemics, fire, seismic activity, and natural
  disasters. For example, we have experienced several small fires in our Normal Factory. While these events were quickly contained
  and resulted in minimal damage and production delay, we cannot guarantee that similar events will not occur in the future, or
  that we will be able to contain such events without damage or delay.

  Should operational risks materialize, it may result in the personal injury to or death of workers, the loss of production equipment,
  damage to manufacturing facilities, products, supplies, tools and materials, monetary losses, delays and unanticipated
  fluctuations in production, environmental damage, administrative fines, increased insurance costs, and potential legal liabilities,
  all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations, and cash
  flows. We cannot be certain that our insurance coverage will be sufficient to cover potential costs and liabilities arising from
  operational risks or at reasonable rates. A loss that is uninsured or exceeds policy limits may require us to pay substantial
  amounts, which could adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.

  Our vehicles rely on software and hardware that is highly technical, and if these systems contain errors, bugs, vulnerabilities,
  or design defects, or if we are unsuccessful in addressing or mitigating technical limitations in our systems, our business could
  be adversely affected.

  Our vehicles rely on software and hardware that is highly technical and complex and will require modification and updates over
  the life of the vehicles. In addition, our vehicles depend on the ability of such software and hardware to store, retrieve, process
  and manage immense amounts of data. Our software and hardware may contain errors, bugs, vulnerabilities or design defects,
  and our systems are subject to certain technical limitations that may compromise our ability to meet our objectives. Some errors,
  bugs, vulnerabilities, or design defects inherently may be difficult to detect and may only be discovered after the code has been
  released for external or internal use. Although we will attempt to remedy any issues we observe in our vehicles effectively and
  rapidly, such efforts may not be timely, may hamper production or may not be to the satisfaction of our customers.




                                                                    21

  Additionally, if we deploy updates to the software (whether to address issues, deliver new features or make desired
  modifications) and our over-the-air update procedures fail to properly update the software or otherwise have unintended
  consequences to the software, the software within our customers’ vehicles will be subject to vulnerabilities or unintended
  consequences resulting from such failure of the over-the-air update until properly addressed.

  If we are unable to prevent or effectively remedy errors, bugs, vulnerabilities or defects in our software and hardware, or fail to
  deploy updates to our software properly, we would suffer damage to our reputation, loss of customers, loss of revenue or liability
  for damages, any of which could adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations, and cash
  flows.

  We must continue to develop complex software and technology systems in coordination with vendors and suppliers to reach
  mass production for our vehicles, and there can be no assurance such systems will be successfully developed or integrated.

  Our vehicles and operations use a substantial amount of complex in-house and third-party software and hardware. The continued
  development and integration of such advanced technologies are inherently complex, and requires us to coordinate with our
  vendors and suppliers to reach mass production for our vehicles. Defects and errors may be revealed over time and our control
  over the performance of third-party services and systems may be limited. Thus, our potential inability to develop and integrate
  the necessary software and technology systems may harm our competitive position.

  We rely on third-party suppliers to develop a number of emerging technologies for use in our products, including battery
  technology and the use of different battery cell chemistries. Certain of these technologies and chemistries are not today, and may
  not ever be, commercially viable. There can be no assurances that our suppliers will be able to meet the technological
  requirements, production timing, and volume requirements to support our business plan. Furthermore, if we experience delays
  by our third-party suppliers, we could experience delays in delivering on our timelines. In addition, the technology may not
  comply with the cost, performance useful life, and warranty characteristics we anticipate in our business plan. As a result, our
  business plan could be significantly impacted and we may incur significant liabilities under warranty claims which could materially
  and adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.

  If there is inadequate access to charging stations, our business will be materially and adversely affected and we may not realize
  the benefits of our charging networks.

  Demand for our vehicles will depend in part upon the availability of a charging infrastructure. We continue to deploy our Rivian
  Adventure Network and Rivian Waypoints, which are networks of charging stations in the United States designed to provide
  charging capability to owners of our vehicles. We market our ability to provide our customers with comprehensive charging
  solutions, including our networks of charging stations, the Rivian Adventure Network and Rivian Waypoints, as well as the
  installation of home chargers for users where practicable, and provide other solutions including charging through publicly
  accessible charging infrastructure. We have limited experience in the actual provision of our charging solutions to customers and
  providing these services is subject to challenges, which include:

       •    charging station performance and reliability issues;
       •    the logistics, including any delays or disruptions, of rolling out and supporting our Rivian Adventure Network and Rivian
            Waypoints and teams in appropriate areas;
       •    successful integration with existing third-party charging networks;
       •    inadequate capacity or over capacity in certain areas, security risks or risk of damage to vehicles, charging equipment or
            real or personal property;
       •    access to sufficient charging infrastructure;
       •    obtaining any required permits, land use rights and filings;
       •    the potential for lack of customer acceptance of our charging solutions; and
       •    the risk that government support for EV and alternative fuel solutions and infrastructure may not continue.

  While the prevalence of charging stations generally has been increasing, charging station locations are significantly less
  widespread than gas stations. Some potential customers may choose not to purchase our vehicles because of the lack of a more
  widespread charging infrastructure and concerns around reliability. Although we intend to expand our charging networks
  throughout the United States and eventually in other countries, with a focus on strategically deploying our charging stations in
  those regions with the highest concentration of customer preorders, major interstates as well as targeted destination areas, we
  may be unable to expand Rivian Adventure Network and Rivian Waypoints as fast as we intend or as

  the public expects, or to place the charging stations in places our customers believe to be optimal, and these networks may not
  result in increased preorders or sales of our vehicles. This could be due to a number of factors, including the inability to secure, or
  delays in securing, suitable locations and permits, problems negotiating leases with landowners, difficulties in interfacing with the
  infrastructures of various utility companies and greater than expected costs and difficulties of installing, maintaining, and
  operating the networks. If we do not realize the benefits of our charging networks, our brand and business, prospects, financial
  condition, results of operations, and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.

  Further, to provide our customers with access to sufficient charging infrastructure, we will rely on the availability of, and
  successful integration of our vehicles with, third-party charging networks. Any failure of third-party charging networks to meet
  customer expectations or needs, including quality of experience, reliability, safety, or security, could impact the demand for EVs,
  including ours. For example, where charging bays exist, the number of vehicles could oversaturate the available charging bays,
  leading to increased wait times and dissatisfaction for customers. In addition, given our limited experience in providing charging
  solutions, there could be unanticipated challenges, which may hinder our ability to provide our solutions or make the provision of
  our solutions costlier than anticipated. To the extent we are unable to meet user expectations or experience difficulties in
  providing our charging solutions, our reputation and business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows
  could be materially and adversely affected.

  Our vehicles use lithium-ion battery cells, which, if not appropriately managed and controlled, have been observed to catch
  fire or vent smoke and flame.

  The battery packs within our vehicles use lithium-ion cells. If not properly managed or subject to environmental stresses, lithium-
  ion cells can rapidly release the energy they contain by venting smoke and flames in a manner that can ignite nearby materials as
  well as other lithium-ion cells. While the battery pack is designed to contain any single cell’s release of energy without spreading
  to neighboring cells, a field or testing failure of battery packs in our vehicles could occur, which could result in bodily injury or
  death and could subject us to lawsuits, field actions (including product recalls), or redesign efforts, all of which would be time
  consuming and expensive and could harm our brand image. Also, negative public perceptions regarding the suitability of lithium-
  ion cells for automotive applications, the social and environmental impacts of mineral mining or procurement associated with the
  constituents of lithium-ion cells, or any future incident involving lithium-ion cells, such as a vehicle or other fire, could materially
  and adversely affect our reputation and business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.

  In addition, we store lithium-ion cells at our facilities and we have experienced, and may in the future experience, thermal events.
  Any mishandling of battery cells or safety issue or fire related to the cells could disrupt our operations and any prolonged or
  significant disruption would materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations or
  cash flows. Such damage or injury could also lead to adverse publicity, regulatory action, and potentially a safety recall. In
  addition, the transportation and effective storage of lithium-ion batteries is also tightly regulated by the U.S. Department of
  Transportation and other regulatory bodies, and any failure to comply with such regulation could result in fines, loss of permits
  and licenses or other regulatory consequences, which could limit our ability to manufacture and deliver our vehicles and
  negatively affect our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.

  We have limited experience servicing and repairing our vehicles. If we or our partners are unable to adequately service our
  vehicles, our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows could be materially and adversely
  affected.

  We have limited experience servicing and repairing our vehicles. Servicing EVs is different than servicing vehicles with internal
  combustion engines and requires specialized skills, including high voltage training and servicing techniques. Although we plan to
  keep core areas of vehicle service internal over time, we continue to partner strategically with third parties in order to enable
  nationwide coverage of certain important services to our customers, such as emergency roadside and off-road assistance, third
  party collision repair support, and tire distribution needs.There can be no assurance that we will be able to enter into an
  acceptable arrangement with any such third-party providers. Although such servicing partners may have experience in servicing
  other vehicles, they will initially have limited experience in servicing our vehicles. We also have a limited network of locations to
  perform service and rely upon mobile service vehicles with technicians to provide service to our customers. There can be no
  assurance that our service arrangements will adequately address the service requirements of our customers to their satisfaction,
  or that we and our servicing partners will have sufficient resources, experience, or inventory to meet these service requirements
  in a timely manner as the volume of EVs we deliver increases. This risk is enhanced by our limited operating history and our
  limited data regarding our vehicles’ real-world reliability and service requirements.




                                                                    23

  In addition, a number of states currently impose limitations on the ability of manufacturers to directly service vehicles. The
  application of these state laws to our operations would hinder or impede our ability to provide services for our vehicles from a
  location in every state. As a result, if we are unable to roll out and establish a widespread service network that complies with
  applicable laws, customer satisfaction could be adversely affected, which in turn could materially and adversely affect our
  reputation and our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.

  As we continue to grow, additional pressure may be placed on our customer support team or partners, and we may be unable to
  respond quickly enough to accommodate short-term increases in customer demand for technical support. Customer behavior
  and usage may result in higher than expected maintenance and repair costs, which may materially and adversely affect our
  business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. We also could be unable to modify the future scope
  and delivery of our technical support to compete with changes in the technical support provided by our competitors. If we are
  unable to successfully address the service requirements of our customers or establish a market perception that we do not
  maintain high-quality support our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows could be
  materially and adversely affected.

  The automotive industry and its technology are rapidly evolving and may be subject to unforeseen changes which could
  adversely affect the demand for our vehicles or increase our operating costs.

  We may be unable to keep up with changes in EV technology or alternatives to electricity as a fuel source and, as a result, our
  competitiveness may suffer. Developments in alternative technologies, such as advanced diesel, hydrogen, ethanol, fuel cells, or
  compressed natural gas, or other improvements in the fuel economy of the ICE or the cost of such fuels, may materially and
  adversely affect our business and prospects in ways we do not currently anticipate. Existing and other battery cell technologies,
  fuels or sources of energy may emerge as customers’ preferred alternative to our vehicles. Any failure by us to develop new or
  enhanced technologies or processes, or to react to changes in existing technologies, could materially delay our development and
  introduction of new and enhanced alternative fuel and EVs, which could result in the loss of competitiveness of our vehicles,
  decreased revenue, and a loss of market share to competitors. Our research and development efforts may not be sufficient to
  adapt to changes in alternative fuel and EV technology. As technologies change, we plan to upgrade or adapt our vehicles with
  the latest technology. However, our vehicles may not compete effectively with alternative systems if we are not able to source
  and integrate the latest technology into our vehicles. Additionally, the introduction and integration of new technologies into our
  vehicles may increase our costs and capital expenditures required for the production and manufacture of our vehicles and, if we
  are unable to cost efficiently implement such technologies or adjust our manufacturing operations, our business, prospects,
  financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows would be materially and adversely affected.

  We are subject to risks associated with advanced driver assistance technology.

  Our vehicles provide advanced driver assistance capabilities to our customers supported by hardware, software, and machine
  learning models. Errors in the design, implementation or execution of these components could lead to increased risk for our
  customers or third-party road users. Advanced driver assistance technologies are subject to risks and there have been accidents
  and fatalities associated with such technologies. The safety of such technologies depends in part on driver interactions, and
  drivers may not be accustomed to using or adapting to such technologies. To the extent accidents associated with our advanced
  driver assistance systems occur, we could be subject to liability, negative publicity, government scrutiny, and further regulation.
  Moreover, any incidents related to advanced driver assistance systems of our competitors could adversely affect the perceived
  safety and adoption of our vehicles and advanced driver assistance technology more broadly.

  Advanced driver assistance technology is also subject to considerable regulatory uncertainty as the law evolves to catch up with
  the rapidly evolving nature of the technology itself. Our vehicles also may not achieve the requisite level of advanced driver
  assistance required for certification and rollout to consumers or satisfy changing regulatory requirements which would require us
  to redesign, modify, or update our advanced driver assistance hardware and related software systems. We may also fail to deliver
  the level of advanced driver assistance systems that customers expect from vehicles in our class. Any of the foregoing could
  materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.

  Our future growth is dependent on the demand for, and upon consumers’ willingness to adopt, EVs.

  Our future growth is dependent on the demand for, and upon consumers’ willingness to adopt EVs, and even if EVs become more
  mainstream, consumers choosing us over other EV manufacturers is not assured. Demand for EVs may be affected by factors
  directly impacting automobile prices or the cost of purchasing and operating automobiles such as sales and financing incentives,
  prices of raw materials and components, cost of energy and governmental regulations, including tariffs, import regulation and
  other taxes. Volatility in demand may lead to lower vehicle unit sales, which may result in downward price pressure and adversely
  affect our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.

  The market for new alternative energy vehicles is still rapidly evolving, characterized by rapidly changing technologies,
  competitive pricing and competitive factors, evolving government regulation and industry standards, and changing consumer
  demands and behaviors. Other factors that may influence the adoption of alternative fuel vehicles, and specifically EVs, include:

       •    perceptions about EV quality, safety, design, performance and cost, especially if negative events or accidents occur that
            are linked to the quality or safety of EVs, whether or not such vehicles are produced by us or other manufacturers,
            resulting in adverse publicity and harm to consumer perceptions of EVs generally;
       •    perceptions about vehicle safety in general, in particular safety issues that may be attributed to the use of advanced
            technology, including EV systems;
       •    range anxiety, including the decline of an EV’s range resulting from deterioration over time in the battery’s usable
            capacity;
       •    the availability of new alternative energy vehicles;
       •    competition, including from other types of alternative fuel vehicles, plug-in hybrid EVs, and high fuel-economy ICE
            vehicles;
       •    the quality and availability of service and charging stations for EVs;
       •    the costs and challenges of installing home charging equipment, including for multi-family, rental, and densely populated
            urban housing;
       •    the environmental consciousness of consumers, and their adoption of EVs;
       •    the higher initial upfront purchase price of EVs, despite lower cost of ongoing operating and maintenance costs,
            compared to ICE vehicles;
       •    the availability of tax and other governmental incentives to purchase and operate EVs and future regulations requiring
            increased use of nonpolluting vehicles;
       •    perceptions about and the actual cost of alternative energy;
       •    volatility in the price of gasoline or other petroleum-based fuel, any extended periods of low gasoline or other
            petroleum-based fuel prices or an improved outlook for the long-term supply of oil to the United States;
       •    regulatory, legislative and political changes; and
       •    macroeconomic factors.

  We will also depend upon the adoption of EVs by operators of commercial vehicle fleets for future growth, and on our ability to
  produce, sell and service vehicles that meet their needs. The entry of commercial EVs is a relatively new development,
  particularly in the United States, and is characterized by rapidly changing technologies and evolving government regulation,
  industry standards and customer views of the merits of using EVs in their businesses. This process has been slow to date. As part
  of our sales efforts, we must educate fleet managers as to the economical savings during the life of the vehicle and the lower TCO
  of our vehicles. As such, we believe that operators of commercial vehicle fleets will consider many factors when deciding whether
  to purchase our commercial EVs (or commercial EVs generally), including the factors set forth above, as well as corporate
  sustainability initiatives, government regulations and economic incentives applicable to commercial vehicles, and the availability
  of commercial fleet charging infrastructure.

  The unavailability, reduction or elimination of government and economic incentives could have a material adverse effect on
  our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.

  Any reduction, elimination, or discriminatory application of government subsidies and economic incentives because of policy
  changes, or the reduced need for such subsidies and incentives due to the perceived success of the EV or other reasons, may
  result in the diminished competitiveness of the alternative fuel and EV industry generally or our vehicles in particular.
  Additionally, federal, state and local laws may impose additional barriers to EV adoption, including additional costs. For example,
  many states have enacted or proposed laws imposing additional registration fees for certain hybrids and EVs to support
  transportation infrastructure, such as highway repairs and improvements, which have traditionally been funded

  through federal and state gasoline taxes. Any of the foregoing could materially and adversely affect the growth of the alternative
  fuel automobile markets and our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.

  While certain tax credits and other incentives for alternative energy production, alternative fuel, and EVs have been available in
  the past, there is no guarantee these programs will be available in the future. For example, the IRA, which was enacted into law
  on August 16, 2022, modifies the 30D tax credit by limiting the tax credit to electric trucks, SUVs and vans priced below $80,000
  and imposing certain income restrictions for taxpayer eligibility to receive the 30D tax credit. Eligibility for the 30D tax credit is
  also contingent on (i) the vehicle’s final assembly occurring in North America, (ii) the vehicle having a certain percentage of the
  battery’s critical minerals originating from a United States free trade agreement partner or being recycled in North America, and
  (iii) the vehicle having a certain percentage of its battery’s components being manufactured or assembled in North America.
  Moreover, if a vehicle battery’s critical minerals were extracted, processed or recycled by a “foreign entity of concern,” such as
  China or Russia, the 30D tax credit would not apply. If our vehicles do not meet the pricing caps or satisfy the additional sourcing
  and manufacturing requirements by the deadlines set forth in the IRA, or if our customers do not fall within the specified income
  limits, some or all of the 30D tax credit may no longer be available to our customers. Failure of our vehicles to meet the 30D tax
  credit eligibility requirements may place our vehicles at a price disadvantage to competing EV manufacturers that offer EVs
  meeting all of the requirements for eligibility under the 30D tax credit. In addition, the IRA eliminates the current phase-out for
  EV manufacturers that sell 200,000 vehicles, thereby reinstating the 30D tax credit for competitors of Rivian who had previously
  been phased out. These changes to the 30D tax credit and any future changes to tax incentives that make it less likely for our EVs
  to qualify could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations, and cash
  flows.

  We may not be able to obtain or agree on acceptable terms and conditions for all or a significant portion of the government
  grants, loans and other incentives, including regulatory credits, for which we apply or on which we rely. As a result, our
  business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.

  From time to time we apply for federal and state grants, loans, and/or tax incentives under government programs designed to
  stimulate the economy and support the production of alternative fuel, and EVs and related technologies. We anticipate that there
  will be new opportunities for us to apply for grants, loans and other incentives from the United States, state and foreign
  governments. Our ability to obtain funds or incentives from government sources is subject to the availability of funds under
  applicable government programs and various levels of approval of our applications to participate in such programs. The
  application process for these funds and other incentives is often highly competitive. There can be no assurance that we will be
  successful in obtaining any of these additional grants, loans and other incentives. If we are not successful in obtaining any of
  these additional incentives and we are unable to find alternative sources of funding to meet our planned capital needs, our
  business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.

  In addition, we earn tradable credits in the operation of our business under various regulations related to ZEV, GHG, fuel
  economy, renewable energy and clean fuel. For example, CAFE, GHG emissions standards and the state-level ZEV mandates
  create a credit-trading program to reduce compliance costs for vehicle manufacturers and to allow flexibility for meeting such
  requirements. These programs allow automakers the flexibility to earn CAFE and ZEV credits by exceeding the standard in a given
  model year, which credits can either be applied to shortfalls in future years or traded to other automakers. We have sold and
  intend to sell these credits to other regulated entities who can use the credits to comply with emission standards, renewable
  energy procurement standards and other regulatory requirements. Such regulatory credits may become more difficult to obtain
  or decrease in value over time. The future of such programs is uncertain at this time.

  In 2020, the EPA and the NHTSA enacted the Safer Affordable Fuel-Efficient (“SAFE”) Vehicles rule that, among other things,
  established less stringent fuel economy and GHG standards for light duty vehicles model years 2021 through 2026, and sought to
  strip California of the ability to set its own fuel economy and vehicle emissions standards, which other states could then follow. In
  2021, changes to the SAFE Vehicles rule were finalized that increased GHG standards stringency for model years 2023 through
  2026, and in 2022, the fuel economy standards were made more stringent for model years 2024 through 2026. In addition, the
  rules reinstating California’s and other states’ authority were finalized in 2022, while California regulators extended the Advance
  Clean Cars rule for model years 2026 through 2035. Concurrently, California’s petition for an EPA Clean Air Act (“CAA”)
  preemption waiver for its new medium and heavy-duty standards has not yet been approved. The waiver process could postpone
  or eliminate the medium and heavy-duty ZEV program and the respective credits. Moreover, the new federal GHG and fuel
  economy standards as well as California’s ability to set its own light-duty standards are still being challenged in several lawsuits. If
  the courts find against EPA and NHTSA or reverse the reinstatement of California and other states’ authority, or if the California
  medium and heavy-duty programs are not granted a CAA waiver, the value of certain regulatory credits would likely decrease. As
  a result, uncertainty remains about the future of California and

  other states’ ZEV and GHG programs and the value of credits earned under them. In addition, new entrants to the EV market
  could drive down relevant compliance credit valuations. While we cannot predict such outcomes at this time, any of the above
  developments could impede our ability to earn and sell such credits and could have a material and adverse effect on our
  business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows in the future.

  Vehicle retail sales depend heavily on affordable interest rates and availability of credit for vehicle financing and a substantial
  increase in interest rates could materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition, results of
  operations, and cash flows.

  In certain regions, including North America and Europe, financing for new vehicle sales has been available at relatively low
  interest rates for several years due to, among other things, expansive government monetary policies. As interest rates have risen,
  market rates for new vehicle financing have also risen, which may make our vehicles less affordable to customers or steer
  customers to less expensive vehicles that would be less profitable for us, adversely affecting our business, prospects, financial
  condition, results of operations, and cash flows. Additionally, if consumer interest rates continue to increase substantially or if
  financial service providers tighten lending standards or restrict their lending to certain classes of credit, customers may not desire
  or be able to obtain financing to purchase or lease our vehicles. As a result, a continuing substantial increase in customer interest
  rates or tightening of lending standards could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition,
  results of operations, and cash flows.

  Insufficient warranty reserves to cover future warranty claims could materially and adversely affect our business, prospects,
  financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.

  As our vehicles are produced, we will need to maintain warranty reserves to cover warranty-related claims. If our warranty
  reserves are inadequate to cover future warranty claims on our vehicles, our business, prospects, financial condition, results of
  operations, and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. We record and adjust warranty reserves based on changes
  in estimated costs and actual warranty costs. Such estimates are inherently uncertain, particularly in light of our limited operating
  history and limited field data available to us, and changes to such estimates based on real-world observations may cause material
  changes to our warranty reserves. In the future, we may become subject to significant and unexpected warranty expenses. There
  can be no assurances that then-existing warranty reserves will be sufficient to cover all claims. In addition, if future laws or
  regulations impose additional warranty obligations on us that go beyond our manufacturer’s warranty, we may be exposed to
  materially higher warranty expenses than we expect, and our reserves may be insufficient to cover such expenses.

  Future field actions, including product recalls, could materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, financial
  condition, results of operations, and cash flows.

  Any field action, including a product recall, whether initiated by us or a supplier, and whether the field action involves our or a
  competitor’s product, may result in adverse publicity, damage our reputation, and adversely affect our business, prospects,
  financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. We and our suppliers have initiated recalls, and expect to initiate recalls
  in the future, voluntarily or involuntarily, if it is determined that a safety-related defect or noncompliance with applicable federal
  motor vehicle safety standards exist in any of our vehicles or components (including our battery cells). For example, in October
  2022 we initiated a voluntary recall of approximately 12,000 vehicles after determining that on a small percentage of vehicles, the
  fastener connecting the front upper control arm and steering knuckle may not have been sufficiently torqued. Recalls, whether
  caused by systems or components engineered or manufactured by us or our suppliers, could involve significant expense, the
  possibility of lawsuits, and diversion of management’s attention and other resources, which could adversely affect our brand and
  our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.

  We will become subject to product liability claims, which could harm our business, prospects, financial condition, results of
  operations, and cash flows if we are not able to successfully defend or insure against such claims.

  We will become subject to product liability claims, which could have a material and adverse effect on our business, prospects,
  financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. The automobile industry experiences an abundance of product liability
  claims. We face the risk of significant monetary exposure to claims in the event our vehicles do not perform as expected or
  contain design, manufacturing, or warning defects, and to claims without merit, or in connection with malfunctions resulting in
  personal injury or death. Our risks in this area are particularly pronounced given the limited field experience of our vehicles. A
  successful product liability claim against us could require us to pay a substantial monetary award. Moreover, a product liability
  claim could generate substantial negative publicity about our vehicles and business and

  inhibit or prevent commercialization of other future vehicle candidates, which would have a material adverse effect on our brand,
  business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. Any insurance coverage might not be sufficient to
  cover all potential product liability claims. Any lawsuit seeking significant monetary damages either in excess of our coverage, or
  outside of our coverage, could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and business, prospects, financial condition,
  results of operations, and cash flows. We may not be able to secure additional product liability insurance coverage on
  commercially acceptable terms or at reasonable costs when needed, particularly if we face liability for our products and are
  forced to make a claim under our policies.

  We face risks associated with establishing and maintaining international operations, including unfavorable regulatory, political,
  currency, tax, and labor conditions, which could harm our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations, and
  cash flows.

  Our business plan includes operations in international markets, including initial manufacturing and supply activities, and sales, in
  select markets in Canada and Europe, and eventual expansion into other international markets. We face risks associated with our
  international operations, including possible unfavorable regulatory, political, tax, and labor conditions, which could harm our
  business. We have established and expect to continue to establish international operations and subsidiaries that are subject to
  the legal, political, regulatory, and social requirements and economic conditions in these jurisdictions. Furthermore, conducting
  and launching operations on an international scale requires close coordination of activities across multiple jurisdictions and time
  zones and consumes significant management resources. We have very limited experience to date selling or leasing and servicing
  our vehicles internationally and international expansion requires us to make significant expenditures, including the hiring of local
  employees and establishing facilities and related systems and processes, in advance of generating any revenue. We are subject to
  a number of risks associated with international business activities that may increase our costs, impact our ability to sell or lease
  our vehicles and require significant management attention. These risks include:

       •    conforming our vehicles to various international regulatory requirements where our vehicles are sold and serviced,
            which requirements may change over time;
       •    difficulty in staffing and managing foreign operations;
       •    difficulties establishing relationships with, or disruption in the supply chain from, international suppliers;
       •    difficulties attracting customers in new jurisdictions;
       •    difficulties in adapting our advanced driver assistance system to new jurisdictions;
       •    foreign government taxes, regulations and permit requirements, including foreign taxes that we may not be able to
            offset against taxes imposed upon us in the United States, and foreign tax and other laws limiting our ability to repatriate
            funds to the United States;
       •    inflation and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, including risks related to any foreign
            currency swap or other hedging activities we undertake;
       •    United States and foreign government trade restrictions, tariffs and price or exchange controls;
       •    foreign labor laws, regulations, and restrictions, including in the areas of supply chain, labor, environmental, health and
            safety and related compliance costs;
       •    foreign data privacy and security laws, regulations and obligations;
       •    expenditures related to foreign lawsuits and liability;
       •    changes in diplomatic and trade relationships, including political risk and customer perceptions based on such changes
            and risks;
       •    concerns raised by foreign governments regarding U.S. policies that may be seen as unfair domestic subsidies contrary to
            World Trade Organization rules or other agreements to which the United States is a party;
       •    laws and business practices favoring local companies;
       •    difficulties protecting or procuring intellectual property rights;
       •    political instability, natural disasters, war (including the ongoing military conflict between Russia and the Ukraine) or
            events of terrorism, and health epidemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic; and
       •    the strength of international economies.

  If we fail to successfully address these risks, our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows
  could be materially and adversely affected.

  Our business depends substantially on the efforts of our key employees and qualified personnel, and if they are unable to
  devote a sufficient amount of time and resources to our business, or if we are unable to attract and retain key employees

  and hire qualified management, technical, electric vehicle and software engineering personnel, our ability to compete could be
  harmed.

  Our success depends substantially on the continued efforts of our executive officers, key employees, and qualified personnel. We
  believe the depth and quality of the experience of our management team in the automotive and technology industries generally,
  and EVs in particular, is key to our ability to be successful. The loss of any of these individuals could have a material adverse effect
  on our business operations. As we build our brand and become more well known, the risk that competitors or other companies
  may poach our talent increases. The failure to motivate and retain these personnel could materially and adversely affect our
  business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.

  In addition, Dr. Scaringe and Rose Marcario, current Rivian directors, are also directors of Forever by Rivian and Rivian’s Chief
  Financial Officer (“CFO”), Claire McDonough, serves as Treasurer of Forever by Rivian. Dr. Scaringe is also director of the Rivian
  Foundation and Ms. McDonough serves as its Treasurer. The positions held by these directors and executive officers may give rise
  to fiduciary or other duties in conflict with the duties they owe to us. Furthermore, such directors and officers may have
  significant duties to, and may devote a substantial amount of time serving, Forever by Rivian and the Rivian Foundation, and
  accordingly may limit their ability to devote a sufficient amount of attention toward their obligations to us, or to day-to-day
  activities of our business.

  Our success also depends, in part, on our continuing ability to identify, hire, attract, train, and develop other highly qualified
  personnel. Rivian’s rapid growth has required a focus on organizational design and ensuring we have the right leaders in place to
  manage the business. We have recruited and hired new leaders with the objective of identifying talent we believe will help scale
  our operations. Experienced and highly skilled employees are in high demand and competition for these employees can be
  intense, especially in California and for talent across product development and all engineering disciplines. In addition, we have
  hired and trained a significant number of employees from the area surrounding the Normal Factory. If there is not an adequate
  number of candidates in the local area to support our operations at full capacity, we may face higher costs to hire employees for
  the Normal Factory and our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows could be adversely affected.

  Our ability to hire, attract, and retain employees depends on our ability to provide competitive compensation and benefits. We
  issue equity awards to our employees as part of our hiring and retention efforts, and job candidates and existing employees often
  consider the value of the equity awards they receive in connection with their employment. If the actual or perceived value of our
  Class A common stock declines, it may adversely affect our ability to hire or retain employees. Any inability to attract, assimilate,
  develop, or retain qualified personnel in the future could adversely affect our business, including the execution of our business
  strategy.

  If we cannot maintain our culture as we grow, we could lose the innovation, teamwork, and passion that we believe contribute
  to our success and our business may be harmed.

  We have invested substantial time and resources into building our culture, and we believe it serves as a critical component of our
  success. As we continue to grow, including geographical expansion, and developing the infrastructure associated with being a
  public company, we will need to maintain our culture across a larger number of employees, disciplines and geographic regions.
  Any failure to preserve our culture could negatively affect our future success, including our ability to attract, engage, and retain
  the talent required to support our future success.

  From time to time, we may need to streamline our organization and adjust the size and structure of our workforce to ensure we
  are focused, agile and efficient to achieve our priorities and objectives. For example, in 2022 and 2023, we implemented certain
  cost reduction efforts to reduce material spend, operating expenses, and capital expenditures and implemented a reduction in
  our workforce. Any reduction in force may yield unintended consequences and costs, such as attrition beyond the intended
  reduction in force, the distraction of employees and reduced employee morale, which could, in turn, adversely impact
  productivity, continuity, accumulated knowledge and efficiency during transitional periods. Any of these impacts could also
  adversely affect our brand and reputation as an employer, making it more difficult for us to attract new employees in the future
  and increasing the risk that we may not achieve the anticipated benefits from the restructuring.

  Our business may be adversely affected by labor and union activities.

  Although none of our employees are currently represented by a labor union, it is common throughout the automobile industry
  generally for employees to belong to a union, which can result in the loss of a direct relationship with our employees, higher
  employee costs, operational restrictions and an increased risk of disruption to operations. If any of our employees decide to join
  or seek recognition to form a labor union, or if we are required to become a union signatory, we

  could be subject to risks as we engage to finalize negotiations with any such union, including substantial distraction from our
  business, potential work slowdowns or stoppages, delays and increased costs. We may also directly and indirectly depend upon
  other companies with unionized work forces, such as component suppliers, construction contractors and trucking and freight
  companies, and work stoppages or strikes organized by such unions could delay the manufacture and sale of our products and
  could have a material adverse impact on our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.

  Our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows may be materially and adversely affected by
  the risks related to health epidemics, including the COVID-19 pandemic.

  We face various risks related to public health issues, including epidemics, pandemics, and other outbreaks, including the COVID-
  19 pandemic. The impact of COVID-19 and associated variants, including changes in consumer and business behavior, pandemic
  fears, market downturns, and restrictions on business and individual activities, created significant volatility starting in early 2020
  in the global economy and led to reduced economic activity. The spread of COVID-19 and associated variants (some of which may
  be more transmissible) also created a disruption in the manufacturing, delivery and overall supply chain of vehicle manufacturers
  and suppliers, and led to a global decrease in vehicle sales in markets around the world.

  The pandemic also resulted in government authorities implementing numerous measures to try to contain the virus, such as
  travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, stay-at-home or shelter-in-place orders, and business shutdowns. These measures
  adversely impacted our employees and operations and the operations of our customers, suppliers, vendors and business
  partners, and negatively impacted our manufacturing plans, sales and marketing activities, business, prospects, financial
  condition, results of operations, and cash flows. Due to operational shutdowns involving certain of our direct and indirect
  suppliers as a result of COVID-19 and associated variants, we experienced and may continue to experience delays and shortages
  of certain parts and materials necessary for the production of our vehicles. In some cases, suppliers were delayed in providing the
  required parts or materials, whereas in other cases, suppliers were able only to fulfill our orders on a partial basis or not at all. As
  a result of such delays and shortages, we adapted our internal designs and processes to remedy or mitigate impacts on our
  production timeline.

  The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will impact our business going forward will depend on the duration, severity and
  potential resurgence of the pandemic, the existence, severity and spread of COVID-19 variants and their impact on us, the actions
  to contain the virus or treat its impact (including the availability of vaccines and boosters), how quickly and to what extent normal
  economic and operating activities can resume. If significant portions of our workforce are unable to work effectively, including
  due to illness, quarantines, social distancing, government actions, or other restrictions in connection with the COVID-19
  pandemic, or if government authorities institute measures such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, stay-at-home or
  shelter-in-place orders, and business shutdowns, our operations will be adversely impacted. Even after the COVID-19 pandemic
  has subsided, we may continue to experience an adverse impact to our business as a result of its global economic impact,
  including any recession that has occurred or may occur in the future, and the ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic or other
  pandemics is highly uncertain.

  Our financial results may vary significantly from period to period due to fluctuations in our product demand, production levels,
  operating costs, working capital, capital expenditures and other factors.

  We expect our period-to-period financial results to vary based on our product demand and operating costs, which we anticipate
  will fluctuate as we continue to design, develop and manufacture new EVs, increase production capacity and establish or expand
  design, research and development, production, and sales and service facilities. Additionally, our revenue from period to period
  may fluctuate as we identify and investigate areas of demand, adjust volumes and add new product derivatives based on market
  demand and margin opportunities, and develop and introduce new EVs or introduce existing EVs to new markets for the first
  time. Our production levels also depend on our ability to obtain vehicle components from our suppliers, the effective operation of
  our manufacturing facilities, our ability to expand our production capacity, and our ability to timely deliver finished vehicles to
  customers. Additionally, our revenue from period to period may fluctuate due to seasonality. Our period-to-period results of
  operations may also fluctuate because of other factors, including labor availability and costs for hourly and management
  personnel, profitability of our vehicles, changes in interest rates, impairment of long-lived assets, macroeconomic conditions,
  both nationally and locally, negative publicity relating to our vehicles, changes in consumer preferences and competitive
  conditions or investment in expansion to new markets. As a result of these factors, we believe that quarter-to-quarter
  comparisons of our financial results, especially in the short term, are not necessarily meaningful and that these comparisons
  cannot be relied upon as indicators of future performance. Significant variation in our quarterly performance could significantly
  and adversely affect the trading price of our Class A common stock.

  We have incurred a significant amount of debt and may in the future incur additional indebtedness. Our payment obligations
  under such indebtedness may limit the funds available to us, and the terms of our current or future debt agreements, contain
  or may contain restrictive covenants that may limit our operating flexibility.

  As of December 31, 2022, our total principal amount of outstanding indebtedness was $1.3 billion. As of December 31, 2022, we
  had no borrowings under our senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility (the “ABL Facility”) and $400 million of letters of
  credit outstanding. Subject to the limitations in the terms of our existing and future indebtedness, we and our subsidiaries may
  incur additional debt in the near-and long-term, secure existing or future debt, or refinance our debt.

  We will be required to use a portion of our future cash flows from operations to pay interest and principal on our indebtedness.
  Such payments will reduce the funds available to use for working capital, operating expenditures, capital expenditures and other
  corporate purposes, and limit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, operating expenditures, capital
  expenditures, expansions plans and other investments, which may in turn limit our ability to execute against our business
  strategy, heighten our vulnerability to downturns in our business, the industry, or in the general economy, and prevent us from
  taking advantage of business opportunities as they arise.

  In addition, the credit agreement governing the ABL Facility and the indenture governing our senior secured floating rate notes
  due October 2026 (the “2026 Notes”) contain, and future debt agreements may contain, restrictive covenants, that, among other
  things, limit our ability to transfer or dispose of assets, merge with other companies or consummate certain changes of control,
  acquire other companies, incur additional indebtedness and liens and enter into new businesses, and a minimum liquidity
  covenant. We therefore may not be able to engage in any of the foregoing transactions unless we obtain the consent of the
  lenders or terminate the credit agreement governing the ABL Facility or future debt agreements, which may limit our operating
  flexibility. In addition, the ABL Facility and the 2026 Notes are secured by all of our assets (however if the Fixed Asset Release
  Date (as defined in the credit agreement governing the ABL Facility) occurs, the ABL Facility will be secured only by certain assets
  until we incur certain other indebtedness that would require the grant of certain security interests) and requires us to satisfy
  certain financial covenants. There is no guarantee that we will be able to generate sufficient cash flow or sales to meet these
  financial covenants or pay the principal and interest when due under our debt agreements. Furthermore, there is no guarantee
  that future working capital, borrowings or equity financing will be available to repay or refinance any such debt. Any inability to
  comply with the terms of the credit agreement governing the ABL Facility, the indenture governing the 2026 Notes, or any future
  debt agreement, including failing to make scheduled payments or to meet the financial covenants, would adversely affect our
  business.

  If our vehicle owners customize our vehicles with aftermarket products, or attempt to modify our vehicles’ charging systems,
  the vehicles may not operate properly, which may create negative publicity and could harm our brand and business.

  Automobile enthusiasts may seek to alter our vehicles to modify their performance which could compromise vehicle safety and
  security systems. Also, customers may customize their vehicles with aftermarket parts that can compromise driver safety. We do
  not test, nor do we endorse, such changes or products. In addition, customers may attempt to modify our vehicles’ charging
  systems or use improper external cabling or unsafe charging outlets that can compromise the vehicle systems or expose our
  customers to injury from high voltage electricity. Such unauthorized modifications could reduce the safety and security of our
  vehicles and any injuries resulting from such modifications could result in adverse publicity, which would negatively affect our
  brand and could have a material and adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations, and cash
  flows.

  We rely on third-party vendors for certain product and service offerings, which exposes us to increased risks.

  We contract with third parties to provide certain products and services to our customers, including vehicle financing, insurance,
  collision repair, roadside assistance, service part processing, service visit alternative transportation, tires, windshields, and 12V
  battery replacement. Although we carefully select our third-party vendors, we cannot control their actions. If our vendors fail to
  perform as we expect, our operations and reputation could suffer if the failure harms the vendors’ ability to serve us and our
  customers. One or more of these third-party vendors may experience financial distress, staffing shortages or liquidity challenges,
  file for bankruptcy protection, go out of business, or suffer disruptions in their business. The use of third-party vendors
  represents an inherent risk to us that could materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition, results of
  operations, and cash flows.

  Certain of our principal stockholders or their affiliates are or may in the future engage in, and certain of our directors are
  affiliated with entities that may in the future engage in, commercial transactions with us, or business activities similar to those
  conducted by us which may compete directly or indirectly with us, causing such stockholders or persons to have conflicts of
  interest.

  Certain of our principal stockholders and their affiliates are engaged in similar business activities to those conducted by us, may
  engage in commercial transactions with us, and currently or in the future may invest in or otherwise hold securities of businesses
  that compete directly or indirectly with us. For example, an affiliate of Amazon.com, Inc., which through another affiliate is also
  one of our principal stockholders, has placed an order with us, subject to modification, for 100,000 vehicles. Amazon will
  continue to be able to influence matters requiring stockholder approval, including any potential change of control transaction,
  regardless of whether or not other stockholders believe that a potential transaction is in our best interest. In turn this may deter
  third parties from seeking to acquire us. These relationships also may give rise to conflicts of interest or create the appearance
  thereof, and such stockholders may take action or vote their shares other ways which could adversely impact us or our other
  stockholders, and may impact other companies’ perception of us as a potential partner, including the willingness of such other
  companies to order our future planned commercial vehicles. Our relationship with Amazon could influence our perceived ability,
  or create the appearance of such influence, to negotiate potential future commercial agreements with Amazon, to allocate our
  limited resources in how we prioritize the delivery of and support for Amazon vehicles relative to our other vehicle models, and
  to pursue other commercial customers who may be competitors to Amazon.

  Further, employees of two of our stockholders and their affiliates serve on our board of directors and retain their positions with
  our principal stockholders or their affiliates. Given such relationships, and despite their fiduciary duties as directors and the rules
  applied by our board of directors to handle conflicts of interest, these individuals’ positions may create, or create the appearance
  of, conflicts of interest when they are asked to make decisions that could have different implications for such principal
  stockholders or their affiliates than the decisions have for us or our other stockholders or customers.

  We are subject to risks associated with exchange rate fluctuations, interest rate changes, commodity and credit risk.

  We operate in numerous markets worldwide and are exposed to risks stemming from fluctuations in currency and interest rates.
  The exposure to currency risk will be mainly linked to differences in the geographic distribution of our manufacturing and
  commercial activities, resulting in cash flows from sales being denominated in currencies different from those of purchases or
  production activities. Although we may manage risks associated with fluctuations in currency and interest rates and commodity
  prices through financial hedging instruments, significant changes in currency or interest rates or commodity prices could have a
  material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. In addition, we may
  use various forms of financing to cover future funding requirements for our activities and changes in interest rates can affect our
  net revenues, finance costs, and margins. Borrowings under the ABL Facility and the 2026 Notes accrue interest at variable rates,
  which exposes us to interest rate risk.

  Risks Related to Information Technology, Intellectual Property, Data Security, and Privacy

  Breaches in data security, failure of information security systems, cyber attacks or other security or privacy-related incidents
  could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and brand, harm our business, prospects, financial condition, results of
  operations, and cash flows and subject us to legal or regulatory fines or damages.

  Threats to networks and information technology infrastructure are increasingly diverse and sophisticated. Traditional computer
  “hackers,” malicious code (such as viruses and worms), phishing attempts, employee theft or misuse, denial of service attacks,
  ransomware attacks, and sophisticated nation-state and nation-state supported actors engage in intrusions and attacks that
  create risks for our (and our suppliers’) internal networks, vehicles, infrastructure, and cloud deployed products and the
  information they store and process, including personal information of our employees and customers, including names, accounts,
  user IDs and passwords, vehicle information, and payment or transaction related information. Although we have implemented
  security measures designed to prevent such attacks, our networks and systems may be breached due to the actions of outside
  parties, employee error, malfeasance, a combination of these, or otherwise, and as a result, an unauthorized party may obtain
  access to our systems, networks, or data, resulting in data being publicly disclosed, altered, lost, or stolen, which could subject us
  to liability and adversely impact our financial condition. Further, any breach in our data security could allow malicious parties to
  access sensitive systems, such as our product lines and the vehicles themselves. Such access could adversely impact the safety of
  our employees and customers. We and our suppliers have in the past been subject to ransomware and phishing attacks. Though
  we do not believe we experienced any material losses or that

  any material sensitive information was compromised, we were unable to determine conclusively that this was the case. While we
  have implemented remedial measures in response to such incidents, we cannot guarantee that such measures will prevent all
  incidents in the future.

  Any actual, alleged or perceived failure to prevent a security breach or to comply with our privacy policies or privacy-related legal
  obligations, failure in our systems or networks, or any other actual, alleged or perceived data security incident we or our suppliers
  suffer, could result in damage to our reputation, negative publicity, loss of customers and sales, loss of competitive advantages
  over our competitors, increased costs to remedy any problems and provide any required notifications, including to regulators and
  individuals, and otherwise respond to any incident, regulatory investigations and enforcement actions, costly litigation, and other
  liabilities. In addition, we may incur significant financial and operational costs to investigate, remediate and implement additional
  tools, devices and systems designed to prevent actual or perceived security breaches, and other security or privacy-related
  incidents, as well as costs to comply with any notification obligations resulting from any such incidents. Further, we could also be
  exposed to a risk of loss or litigation and potential liability under laws, regulations and, contracts that protect the privacy and
  security of personal information. Any of these negative outcomes could adversely impact the market perception of our products
  and customer and investor confidence in our company, and would materially and adversely affect our business, prospects,
  financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.

  While we maintain cyber insurance that may help provide coverage for security breaches or other incidents, such insurance may
  not be adequate to cover the costs and liabilities related to them, which in some cases could impact our operating results and
  financial condition. In addition, our insurance policy may change as a result of such incidents or for other reasons, which may
  result in premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co-insurance requirements.

  If we fail to comply with federal, state, and foreign laws relating to privacy and data security, we may face potentially
  significant liability, negative publicity, and an erosion of trust, and increased regulation could materially and adversely affect
  our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.

  We receive, store, handle, transmit, use and otherwise process business information and information related to individuals from
  and about actual and prospective customers, as well as our employees and service providers. As a result, we and our handling of
  data are subject to a variety of laws, rules and regulations relating to privacy and data security, as well as contractual obligations
  and industry standards. In the United States, a violation of consumers’ privacy rights or failure to take appropriate steps to keep
  consumers information secure may constitute unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce in violation of the
  Federal Trade Commission Act or similar state consumer laws enforced by state attorneys general. We may also be subject to
  various generally applicable federal and state privacy laws that are specific to certain industries, sectors, contexts, or locations.
  For example, we may be subject to state privacy laws such as the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”), as amended
  by the California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”), as well as other privacy statutes that share similarities to the CPRA that have been
  enacted in certain other states. As we continue to expand our foreign operations, we may also become subject to international
  privacy laws such as the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (“GDPR”), the U.K. Data Protection
  Act of 2018, and other international data protection, privacy, data security, data localization and similar national, state, provincial,
  and local laws.

  These laws, rules and regulations are constantly evolving and may be interpreted, applied, created, or amended in a manner that
  could harm our current or future business and operations and may result in ever increasing regulatory and public scrutiny and
  escalating levels of enforcement and sanctions. Any significant changes to applicable laws, regulations or industry practices
  regarding the use or disclosure of our users’ data, or regarding the manner in which the express or implied consent of users for
  the use and disclosure of such data is obtained – or in how these applicable laws, regulations or industry practices are interpreted
  and enforced by state, federal and international privacy regulators – could require us to modify our services and features, possibly
  in a material and costly manner, may subject us to legal claims, regulatory enforcement actions and fines, and may limit our
  ability to develop new services and features that make use of the data that our users voluntarily share with us.

  Although we make reasonable efforts to comply with all applicable data protection laws and regulations, our interpretations and

  reputation, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, results of
  operations, and cash flows.

  Any unauthorized control or manipulation of our vehicles’ systems could result in a loss of confidence in us and our vehicles
  and harm our business.

  Our vehicles contain complex technology systems. For example, our vehicles are outfitted with built-in data connectivity to install
  periodic remote updates to improve or update the functionality of our vehicles. We have implemented cryptographic
  technologies to deliver updates securely from Rivian including a hardware security module to verify the integrity of vehicle
  software by using cryptographic hashes. We have designed, implemented, and tested security measures intended to prevent
  cybersecurity breaches or unauthorized access to our information technology networks, our vehicles and their systems, and
  intend to implement additional security measures as necessary. However, hackers and other malicious actors may attempt in the
  future to gain unauthorized access to modify, alter, and use networks, vehicle software and our systems to gain control of, or to
  change, our vehicles’ software or to gain access to data stored in or generated by the vehicle. Errors and vulnerabilities, including
  zero days, in our information technology systems will be probed by third parties and could be identified and exploited in the
  future, and our remediation efforts may not be timely or successful. Any unauthorized access to or control of our vehicles or their
  systems or any unauthorized access to or loss of data could result in risks to our customers, unsafe driving conditions, or failure of
  our systems, any of which could result in interruptions in our business, legal claims or proceedings which may or may not result in
  our favor and could subject us to significant liability. In addition, regardless of their veracity, reports of unauthorized access to our
  vehicles, their systems or data, as well as other factors that may result in the perception that our vehicles, their systems or data
  are capable of being “hacked” and lack appropriate safety controls, could negatively affect our brand and harm our business,
  prospects, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.

  We utilize third-party service providers to support our service and business operations and any errors, disruption, performance
  problems, delays or failure in their or our operational infrastructure could materially and adversely affect our business,
  prospects, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.

  Our brand, reputation and ability to attract customers depends on the reliable performance of our vehicles and the supporting
  systems, technology, and infrastructure. For example, we outfit our vehicles with in-vehicle services and functionality that use
  data connectivity to monitor performance and capture opportunities for cost-saving preventative maintenance. The availability
  and effectiveness of these services depend on the continued operation of information technology and communication systems.
  We primarily rely on Amazon Web Services in the United States to host our cloud computing and storage needs. We do not own,
  control, or operate our cloud computing physical infrastructure or their data center providers. If any of these third-party services
  experience errors, disruptions, security issues, or other performance deficiencies, if they are updated such that our platforms
  become incompatible, if these services, software, or hardware fail or become unavailable due to extended outages, interruptions,
  defects, or otherwise, or if they are no longer available on commercially reasonable terms or prices (or at all), these issues could
  result in errors or defects in our platforms, cause our platforms to fail, or could adversely affect the experience of our customers,
  our reputation and brand could be damaged, we could be exposed to legal or contractual liability, our expenses could increase,
  and our ability to manage our operations could be interrupted, all of which may take significant time and resources, increase our
  costs, and could adversely affect our business. We may also have additional liability to our customers which may not be fully
  compensated by third-party service providers or insurance.

  We are, and may in the future become, subject to patent, trademark and/or other intellectual property infringement claims,
  which may be time-consuming, cause us to incur significant liability, and increase our costs of doing business.

  We are involved in, and may in the future become party to additional, intellectual property infringement proceedings.
  Companies, organizations, or individuals, including our competitors, may hold or obtain patents, trademarks or other proprietary
  or intellectual property rights that would prevent, limit or interfere with our ability to make, use, develop, sell, lease or market
  our vehicles or components, which could make it more difficult for us to operate our business. From time to time, we may receive
  communications from holders of patents, trademarks, trade secrets or other intellectual property or proprietary rights alleging
  that we are infringing, misappropriating, diluting or otherwise violating such rights. Such parties have brought and may in the
  future bring suits against us alleging infringement or other violation of such rights, or otherwise assert their rights and urge us to
  take licenses to their intellectual property. Our applications for and uses of trademarks relating to our products, services, or
  designs, could be found to infringe upon existing trademark rights owned by third

  parties. We may not be aware of existing patents or patent applications that could be pertinent to our business as many patent
  applications are filed confidentially in the United States and are not published until 18 months following the applicable filing date.
  In the event that a claim relating to intellectual property is asserted against us, our suppliers or our third-party licensors, or if
  third parties not affiliated with us hold pending or issued patents that relate to our products or technology, we may need to seek
  licenses to such intellectual property or seek to challenge those patents. Even if we are able to obtain a license, it could be non-
  exclusive, thereby giving our competitors and other third parties access to the same technologies licensed to us. In addition, we
  may be unable to obtain these licenses on commercially reasonable terms, if at all, and our challenge of third-party patents may
  be unsuccessful. Litigation or other legal proceedings relating to intellectual property claims, regardless of merit, may cause us to
  incur significant expenses, could distract our technical and management personnel from their normal responsibilities and result in
  negative publicity. Further, if we are determined to have infringed upon a third party’s intellectual property rights, we may be
  required to do one or more of the following:

       •    cease selling or leasing, incorporating certain components into, or using vehicles or offering goods or services that
            incorporate or use the intellectual property that we allegedly infringe, misappropriate, dilute, or otherwise violate;
       •    pay substantial royalty or license fees or other damages;
       •    seek a license from the holder of the infringed intellectual property right, which license may not be available on
            reasonable terms, or at all;
       •    redesign or reengineer our vehicles or other technology, goods or services, which may be costly, time-consuming, or
            impossible; or
       •    establish and maintain alternative branding for our products and services.

  Furthermore, many of our employees were previously employed by other automotive companies, by suppliers to automotive
  companies or companies with similar or related technology, products or services. We are, and may in the future become, subject
  to claims that we or these employees have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed trade secrets or other proprietary
  information of former employers. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. If we fail in defending such claims,
  we may be forced to pay monetary damages or fines and be enjoined from using certain technology, products, services, or
  knowledge. Even if we are successful in defending against these claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and demand on
  management resources.

  We may not be able to prevent others from unauthorized use of our intellectual property, which could harm our business and
  competitive position.

  We may not be able to prevent others from unauthorized use of our intellectual property, which could harm our business and
  competitive position. We rely on a combination of patent, trade secret (including those in our know-how), and other intellectual
  property laws, as well as employee and third-party nondisclosure agreements, intellectual property licenses, and other
  contractual rights to establish and protect our rights in our technology and intellectual property. Our patent or trademark
  applications may not be granted, any patents or trademark registrations that may be issued to us may not sufficiently protect our
  intellectual property and any of our issued patents, trademark registrations or other intellectual property rights may be
  challenged by third parties. Any of these scenarios may result in limitations in the scope of our intellectual property or restrictions
  on our use of our intellectual property or may adversely affect the conduct of our business. Despite our efforts to protect our
  intellectual property rights, there can be no assurance that these protections will be available in all cases or will be adequate to
  prevent our competitors or other third parties from attempting to copy, reverse engineer or otherwise obtain and use our
  intellectual property or seek court declarations that they do not infringe, misappropriate or otherwise violate our intellectual
  property. Monitoring unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult and costly, and the steps we have taken or will take
  to prevent misappropriation may not be successful. From time to time, we may have to resort to litigation to enforce our
  intellectual property rights, which could result in substantial costs and diversion of our resources.

  In addition, patent, trademark, and trade secret laws vary significantly throughout the world. A number of foreign countries do
  not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States. Therefore, our intellectual
  property rights may not be as strong or as easily enforced outside of the United States. Failure to adequately protect our
  intellectual property rights could result in our competitors offering similar products, potentially resulting in the loss of some of
  our competitive advantage and a decrease in our revenue which would adversely affect our business, prospects, financial
  condition, results of operations, or cash flows.

  Our patent applications may not issue as patents, which may have a material adverse effect on our ability to prevent others
  from commercially exploiting products similar to ours. If our patents expire or are not maintained, our patent

  applications are not granted or our patent rights are contested, circumvented, invalidated or limited in scope, we may not be
  able to prevent others from selling, developing or exploiting competing technologies or products, which could have a material
  adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.

  We cannot be certain that we are the first inventor of the subject matter to which we have filed a particular patent application, or
  that we are the first party to file such a patent application. If another party has filed a patent application for the same subject
  matter as we have, we may not be entitled to the protection sought by the patent application. Further, the scope of protection of
  issued patent claims is often difficult to determine. As a result, we cannot be certain that the patent applications that we file will
  issue, or that our issued patents will afford protection against competitors with similar technology. In addition, our competitors
  may design around our issued patents, which could adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition, results of
  operations, and cash flows.

  There can be no assurance that our pending applications will issue as patents. Even if our patent applications result in issued
  patents, these patents may be contested, circumvented or invalidated in the future. In addition, the rights granted under any
  issued patents may not provide us with adequate protection or competitive advantages. The claims under any patents that issue
  from our patent applications may not be broad enough to prevent others from developing technologies that are similar or that
  achieve results similar to ours. The intellectual property rights of others could also bar us from licensing and exploiting any
  patents that issue from our pending applications. Numerous patents and pending patent applications owned by others exist in
  the fields in which we have developed and are developing our technology. Many of these existing patents and patent applications
  might have priority over our patent applications and could subject our patents to invalidation or our patent applications to
  rejection. Finally, in addition to patents with an earlier priority date and patent applications that were filed before our patent
  applications that may affect the likelihood of issuance of patents we are seeking, any of our existing or future patents may also be
  challenged by others on grounds that may render our patent applications or issued patents invalid or unenforceable.

  Our use of open source software in our applications could subject our proprietary software to general release, adversely affect
  our ability to sell our services and subject us to possible litigation, claims or proceedings.

  We use open source software in connection with the development and deployment of our products and services, and we expect
  to continue to use open source software in the future. Companies that use open source software in connection with their
  products have, from time to time, faced claims challenging the use of open source software and/or compliance with open source
  license terms. As a result, we could be subject to suits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open source
  software or claiming noncompliance with open source licensing terms, and we may be required to purchase a costly license or
  cease offering the implicated products or services unless and until we can reengineer them to avoid infringement, which may be a
  costly and time-consuming process, and we may not be able to complete the reengineering process successfully. Some open
  source software licenses may require users who distribute proprietary software containing or linked to open source software to
  publicly disclose all or part of the source code to such proprietary software and/or make available any derivative works of the
  open source code under the same open source license, which could include proprietary source code. In such cases, the open
  source software license may also restrict us from charging fees to licensees for their use of our software. While we monitor the
  use of open source software and try to ensure that open source software is not used in a manner that would subject our
  proprietary source code to these requirements and restrictions, such use could inadvertently occur or could be claimed to have
  occurred, in part because open source license terms are often ambiguous and have generally not been interpreted by United
  States or foreign courts. Any actual or claimed requirement to disclose our proprietary source code or pay damages for breach of
  contract could harm our business and could help third parties, including our competitors, develop products and services that are
  similar to or better than ours.

  Further, in addition to risks related to license requirements, use of certain open source software carries greater technical and
  legal risks than does the use of third-party commercial software. For example, open source software is generally provided as-is
  without any support or warranties or other contractual protections regarding infringement or the quality of the code, including
  the existence of security vulnerabilities. To the extent that our platform depends upon the successful operation of open source
  software, any undetected errors or defects in open source software that we use could prevent the deployment or impair the
  functionality of our systems and injure our reputation. In addition, the public availability of such software may make it easier for
  attackers to target and compromise our platform through cyber-attacks. Any of the foregoing risks could materially and adversely
  affect our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.

  Risks Related to Other Legal, Regulatory, and Tax Matters

  Our vehicles are subject to motor vehicle safety standards and the failure to satisfy such mandated safety standards would
  have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.

  All vehicles sold must comply with international, federal, and state motor vehicle safety standards. In the United States, vehicles
  that meet or exceed all federally mandated safety standards are self-certified by the manufacturer under the federal regulations.
  Rigorous testing and the use of approved materials and equipment are among the requirements for achieving federal
  certification. Other jurisdictions outside the United States, such as Europe, require us to meet Type Approval, the process for
  meeting the EU certification requirements, proving to regulators that our vehicles meet those relevant safety standards in effect
  in those countries. Failure by us to maintain compliance of the R1T, R1S, EDV, or obtain certification of compliance for any future
  EV model with motor vehicle safety standards in the United States, Canada, the EU or other jurisdictions would have a material
  adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.

  We may be exposed to delays, limitations, and risks related to the environmental permits and other permits and approvals
  required to operate or expand operations at our manufacturing facility and any future facilities.

  Operation of an automobile manufacturing facility requires proper land use, environmental permits and other operating permits
  from federal, state and local government entities. While we currently have all permits necessary to carry out and perform our
  current plans and operations at our Normal Factory, expansion of operations at our facility and the construction or operation of
  our planned facility in Georgia, may require land use changes, and environmental and operating permits. See Part I, Item 3 “Legal
  Proceedings” for additional information on matters related to our planned facility in Georgia. Delays, denials, or restrictions on
  any of the applications for or assignment of the permits to operate our facility or any future facility we may acquire or construct,
  including service centers and parts distribution centers, could adversely affect our ability to execute on our business plans and
  objectives.

  We are subject to various environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations that could impose substantial costs upon us
  and cause delays in building our manufacturing facilities.

  As an automobile manufacturer, we and our operations, both in the United States and abroad, are subject to national, state,
  provincial and/or local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including laws relating to the use, handling,
  storage, and disposal of, and human exposure to, hazardous materials. Environmental, health and safety laws, and regulations can
  be complex, and we expect that our business and operations will be affected by future amendments to such laws or other new
  environmental, health and safety laws which may require us to change our operations, potentially resulting in a material adverse
  effect on our business. These laws can give rise to liability for administrative oversight costs, cleanup costs, property damage,
  bodily injury, and fines and penalties. Compliance with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations could also lead to
  increased costs of compliance, including remediation of any discovered issues, and changes to our operations, which may be
  significant, and failures to comply could result in significant expenses, delays, substantial fines and penalties, third-party
  damages, suspension of production or a cessation of our operations.

  Contamination at properties currently or formerly owned or operated by us, as well as at properties we will own and operate, and
  properties to which hazardous substances were sent by us, may result in liability for us under environmental laws and regulations,
  including, but not limited to the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”), which can
  impose liability for the full amount of contamination response-related costs without regard to fault, for the investigation and
  cleanup of contaminated soil and ground water, for building contamination and impacts to human health, and for damages to
  natural resources. The costs of complying with environmental laws, including CERCLA, and regulations and any claims concerning
  noncompliance, or liability with respect to contamination in the future, could have a material adverse effect on our business,
  prospects, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.

  Our operations are also subject to federal, state, provincial, and local workplace safety laws and regulations, including the U.S.
  Occupational Health and Safety Act, and equivalent international laws and regulations, which require compliance with various
  workplace safety requirements, including requirements related to environmental safety. These laws and regulations can give rise
  to liability for oversight costs, compliance costs, bodily injury (including workers’ compensation), fines, and penalties.
  Additionally, non-compliance could result in delay or suspension of production or cessation of operations. The costs required to
  comply with workplace safety laws can be significant, and non-compliance could adversely affect our

  production or other operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, brand, prospects and results of
  operations.

  We are subject to substantial and evolving regulation and unfavorable changes to, or our failure to comply with, these
  regulations could substantially harm our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.

  Our vehicles, and the sale of motor vehicles in general, are subject to substantial regulation under international, federal, state,
  and local laws. We expect to incur significant costs in complying with these regulations. Regulations related to the electric vehicle
  industry and alternative energy are currently evolving and we face risks associated with changes to these regulations, such as:

       •    the imposition of a carbon tax or the introduction of a cap-and-trade system on electric utilities, either of which could
            increase the cost of electricity and thereby the cost of operating an electric vehicle;
       •    new state regulations of electric vehicle fees could discourage consumer demand for EVs;
       •    the increase of subsidies for alternative fuels such as corn and ethanol could reduce the operating cost of vehicles that
            use such alternative fuels and gasoline, and thereby reduce the appeal of EVs;
       •    changes to the regulations governing the assembly and transportation of battery cells could increase the cost of battery
            cells or make such commodities more difficult to obtain;
       •    new regulations regarding the content of battery cells or packs, including mineral composition, mandatory recycling, or
            take back programs that require us to comply with new sets of laws and regulations;
       •    changes in regulation that affect vehicle design or engineering, for example relating to the noise required to be emitted
            by EVs, may impact the design or function of EVs, and thereby lead to decreased consumer appeal;
       •    changes in regulations governing the range and miles per gallon of gasoline-equivalent calculations could lower our
            vehicles’ ratings, making EVs less appealing to consumers; and
       •    future rulemaking governing GHG and CAFE standards could reduce new business opportunities for our business.

  To the extent the laws change, our vehicles may not comply with applicable international, federal, state or local laws, which
  would have an adverse effect on our business. Compliance with changing regulations could be burdensome, time consuming, and
  expensive. To the extent compliance with new regulations is cost prohibitive, our business, prospects, financial condition, results
  of operations, or cash flows would be materially and adversely affected.

  Internationally, there may be laws in jurisdictions we have not yet entered or laws we are unaware of in jurisdictions we have
  entered that may restrict our sales or other business practices. Even for those jurisdictions we have analyzed, the laws in this area
  can be complex, difficult to interpret and may change over time. Continued regulatory limitations and other obstacles interfering
  with our ability to sell or lease vehicles directly to consumers could have a negative and material impact on our business,
  prospects, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.

  We are or may be subject to risks associated with strategic alliances or acquisitions.

  We may from time to time consider entering into strategic alliances, including joint ventures, minority equity investments or
  other transactions, with various third parties to further our business purpose. However, there are no assurances that we will be
  able to identify or secure suitable alliances in the future or that we will be able to maintain such alliances, which could impair our
  overall growth. In addition, these alliances could subject us to a number of risks, including risks associated with sharing
  proprietary information, with non-performance by the third party and with increased expenses in establishing new strategic
  alliances, any of which may materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations, and
  cash flows. We may have limited ability to monitor or control the actions of these third parties and, to the extent any of these
  strategic third parties suffer negative publicity or harm to their reputation from events relating to their business, we may also
  suffer negative publicity or harm to our reputation by virtue of our association with any such third party.

  When appropriate opportunities arise, we may acquire additional assets, products, technologies, or businesses that are
  complementary to our existing business. In addition to possible stockholder approval, we may need approvals and licenses from
  relevant government authorities for the acquisitions and to comply with any applicable laws and regulations, which could result
  in increased delay and costs, and may disrupt our business strategy if we fail to do so. Furthermore, acquisitions and the
  subsequent integration of new assets and businesses into our own require significant attention from our management and could
  result in a diversion of resources from our existing business, which in turn could have an adverse effect on our operations.
  Acquired assets or businesses may not generate the financial results we expect. Acquisitions could

  result in the use of substantial amounts of cash, potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities, the occurrence of significant
  goodwill impairment charges, amortization expenses for other intangible assets, and exposure to potential unknown liabilities of
  the acquired business. Moreover, the costs of identifying and consummating acquisitions may be significant.

  Our business could be adversely affected by trade tariffs or other trade barriers.

  Our business is subject to the imposition of tariffs and other trade barriers, which may make it more costly for us to export our
  vehicles to the imposing country. For example, in recent years the United States government has renegotiated or terminated
  certain existing bilateral or multi-lateral trade agreements. It has also imposed tariffs on certain foreign goods which resulted in
  increased costs for goods imported into the United States. In response to these tariffs, a number of United States trading partners
  have imposed retaliatory tariffs on a wide range of United States products, making it more costly for companies to export
  products to those countries. If we experience cost increases as a result of existing or future tariffs, and are unable to pass on such
  additional costs to our customers, or otherwise mitigate the costs, or if demand for our exported vehicles decreases due to the
  higher cost, our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, China and the United States have
  each imposed tariffs, indicating the potential for further trade barriers which may escalate a nascent trade war between China
  and the United States. The resulting environment of retaliatory trade or other practices or additional trade restrictions or barriers,
  if implemented on a broader range of products or raw materials, could harm our ability to obtain necessary inputs or sell our
  vehicles at prices customers are willing to pay, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of
  operations, and cash flows.

  We are subject to export and import control laws, and non-compliance with such laws can subject us to criminal liability and
  other serious consequences, which can harm our business.

  We are subject to export control laws, import and economic sanctions laws and regulations, including the United States Export
  Administration Regulations, United States Customs regulations, and various economic and trade sanctions regulations
  administered by the United States Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control. United States export controls apply to
  (1) items that are produced in the United States, wherever they are geographically located; (2) all items located in the United
  States, even if only moving in transit through the United States; and (3) certain foreign-produced items, including those that
  incorporate more than de minimis levels of controlled United States-origin content. A violation of applicable laws could subject us
  to whistleblower complaints, adverse media coverage, investigations, and severe administrative, civil and criminal penalties,
  collateral consequences, remedial measures and legal expenses. In addition, we may in the future establish international
  operations for the reassembly or manufacture of our vehicles, which could subject us to additional constraints under applicable
  export and import controls and laws.

  In addition, changes to our vehicles, or changes in applicable export control, import or economic sanctions laws and regulations,
  may create delays in the introduction and sale of our vehicles and solutions or, in some cases, prevent the export or import of our
  vehicles to certain countries, governments or persons altogether. Any change in export, import, or economic sanctions laws and
  regulations, shift in the enforcement or scope of existing laws and regulations or change in the countries, governments, persons
  or technologies targeted by such laws and regulations could also result in decreased use of our vehicles, as well decreasing our
  ability to export or market our vehicles to potential customers. Any decreased use of our vehicles or limitation on our ability to
  export or market our vehicles could adversely affect our business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition.

  We are subject to anti-corruption, anti-bribery, anti-money laundering, and similar laws, and non-compliance with such laws
  can subject us to administrative, civil and criminal fines and penalties, collateral consequences, remedial measures and legal
  expenses, all of which could adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.

  We are subject to anti-corruption, anti-bribery, anti-money laundering, financial and economic sanctions and similar laws and
  regulations in various jurisdictions in which we conduct or in the future may conduct activities, including the United States
  Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”), the U.K. Bribery Act 2010, and other anti-corruption laws and regulations. Anti-corruption
  laws are interpreted broadly and prohibit companies and their officers, directors, employees, agents, contractors and other
  business partners from corruptly offering, promising, authorizing or providing anything of value to recipients in the public or
  private sector for the purposes of influencing decisions or obtaining or retaining business or otherwise obtaining favorable
  treatment. Our policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these regulations may not be sufficient and our
  directors, officers, employees, representatives, consultants, agents, and business partners could engage in improper




                                                                    39

  conduct for which we may be held responsible, even if we do not explicitly authorize or have actual knowledge of such conduct.

  Non-compliance with anti-corruption, anti-bribery or anti-money laundering laws could subject us to whistleblower complaints,
  adverse media coverage, investigations, and severe administrative, civil and criminal sanctions, collateral consequences, remedial
  measures and legal expenses, all of which could materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition,
  results of operations, and cash flows.

  We are subject to legal proceedings in the ordinary course of our business. If the outcomes of these proceedings are adverse to
  us, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.

  We are subject to various litigation matters from time to time, the outcome of which could have a material adverse effect on our
  business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. Claims arising out of actual or alleged violations of law could
  be asserted against us by individuals, either individually or through class actions, by governmental entities in civil or criminal
  investigations and proceedings or by other entities. These claims could be asserted under a variety of laws, including but not
  limited to consumer finance laws, consumer protection laws, contract laws, tort laws, environmental laws, intellectual property
  laws, privacy laws, labor and employment laws, employee benefit laws, and securities laws. For example, in March and April 2022
  three separate stockholder class action lawsuits were filed against the Company, its directors, certain officers and its initial public
  offering (“IPO”) underwriters alleging violations of United States securities laws, including the Securities Act and the Exchange
  Act. Securities litigation, and other related matters such as governmental or regulatory investigations, could have a material
  adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, reputation and cash flows, as well as on the market price
  of our Class A common stock. We have also been subject to, and may become subject to, allegations of discrimination or other
  similar misconduct, as well as allegations of breach of contract or other acts or omissions by or on behalf of us. These actions
  could expose us to adverse publicity that could harm our brand, reputation, and operations and to substantial monetary damages
  and legal defense costs, injunctive relief and criminal and civil fines and penalties, including but not limited to suspension or
  revocation of licenses to conduct business. Although the results of lawsuits and claims cannot be predicted with certainty,
  defending these claims is costly and can impose a significant burden on management and employees. Any litigation to which we
  are a party may result in an onerous or unfavorable judgment that may not be reversed on appeal, or we may decide to settle
  lawsuits on similarly unfavorable terms. Any such negative outcome could result in payments of substantial monetary damages or
  fines, or changes to our business practices, and accordingly our business could be seriously harmed. See Part I, Item 3 “Legal
  Proceedings.”

  Changes in tax laws and the application of such laws may materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, financial
  condition, results of operations, and cash flows.

  New income, sales, use or other tax laws, statutes, rules, regulation, or ordinances could be enacted at any time, or interpreted,
  changed, modified, or applied adversely to us, any of which could adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition,
  results of operations, and cash flows. In particular, presidential, congressional, state, and local elections in the United States could
  result in significant changes in, and uncertainty with respect to, tax legislation, regulation and government policy directly affecting
  our business or indirectly affecting us because of impacts on our customers, suppliers and manufacturers. For example, the
  United States government may enact significant changes to the taxation of business entities including, among others, an increase
  in the corporate income tax rate and the imposition of minimum taxes or surtaxes on certain types of income. To the extent that
  such changes occur and have a negative impact on us, our suppliers, manufacturers or our customers, including as a result of
  related uncertainty, these changes could materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition, results of
  operations, and cash flows.

  Our ability to use net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes is limited due to certain provisions of the Internal
  Revenue Code.

  We have incurred substantial losses during our history and do not expect to become profitable in the foreseeable future, and we
  may never achieve profitability. Under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, federal net operating losses (“NOLs”) we generated in tax years
  through December 31, 2017 may be carried forward for 20 years and may fully offset taxable income in the year utilized, and
  federal NOLs we generated in tax years beginning after December 31, 2017 may be carried forward indefinitely but may only be
  used to offset 80% of our taxable income annually. Under Sections 382 and 383 of the Code, if a corporation undergoes an
  “ownership change,” the corporation’s ability to use its pre-change federal NOLs and other tax attributes (such as research and
  development tax credits) to offset its post-change income and taxes may be limited. In general, an




                                                                    40

26/04/23, 09:03                                                          rivn-20221231

  “ownership change” occurs if there is a greater than 50 percentage point change (by value) in a corporation’s equity ownership by
  certain stockholders over a rolling three-year period. We have experienced ownership changes in the past and may experience
  ownership changes in the future as a result of subsequent shifts in our stock ownership (some of which shifts are outside our
  control). As a result, our ability to use our pre-change federal NOLs and other tax attributes to offset future taxable income and
  taxes could be subject to limitations. Similar provisions of state tax law may also apply and future regulatory changes could also
  limit our ability to utilize NOL carryforwards. For these reasons, even if we achieve profitability, we may be unable to use a
  material portion of our NOLs and other tax attributes, which could potentially result in increased future income tax liability to us
  and materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.

  Increasing scrutiny and changing expectations from global regulations, our investors, consumers and employees with respect
  to our environmental, social, and governance (“ESG”) practices may impose additional costs on us or expose us to new or
  additional risks.

  Companies across many industries are facing increasing scrutiny related to their ESG practices and reporting. Investors,
  consumers, employees and other stakeholders have focused increasingly on ESG practices and placed increasing importance on
  the implications and social cost of their investments, purchases and other interactions with companies. With this increased focus,
  public reporting regarding ESG practices is becoming more broadly expected. Any failure or perceived failure to accomplish or
  accurately track and report on our ESG initiatives on a timely basis or to meet investor, consumer or employee expectations on
  ESG matters, particularly because our mission is to create products and services that help our planet transition to carbon neutral
  energy and transportation, could adversely affect our brand and reputation, our employees’ engagement and retention and the
  willingness of our customers and partners to do business with us.

  We may at times engage in voluntary initiatives (such as voluntary disclosures, certifications, or goals, among others) or
  commitments to improve our ESG profile, and any such initiatives or achievements of such commitments may be costly. For
  example, our commitment to The Climate Pledge, pursuant to which signatories pledge to reach net-zero emissions by 2040, and
  subsequent reporting and emissions reductions and offsets would require considerable investments, and our commitment, with
  all of their contingencies, dependencies, and in certain cases, reliance on third-party verification and/or performance, is complex
  and ambitious, and we cannot guarantee that we will meet our commitment. Our ability to achieve this commitment is subject to
  numerous risks, many of which are outside of our control. Such risks include the availability and cost of low or non-carbon based
  energy sources, the evolving regulatory requirements affecting ESG standards or disclosures, the availability of suppliers that can
  meet our sustainability, diversity and other ESG standards, our ability to recruit, develop and retain a diverse range of talent, and
  other items discussed in these risk factors. Additionally, certain disclosures or targets may be based on assumptions, estimates,
  hypothetical expectations, or third-party information, which are necessarily uncertain and may be prone to errors or subject to
  misinterpretation given the long timelines involved and the lack of an established single approach to identifying, measuring, and
  reporting on many ESG matters. Our processes and controls to identify, measure, and report on ESG metrics may change to reflect
  evolving methodologies, standards, internal control, and data availability and quality. This may require us to incur significant costs
  and may impact our ESG initiatives, including reported progress on, and ability to achieve, any of our goals, either on an initial
  timeline or at all. Implementing and achieving our commitment may also result in increased costs in our supply chain and
  business operations. Furthermore, if our competitors’ corporate responsibility performance is perceived to be greater than ours,
  including performance on third-party benchmarks and scores used by certain market participants, potential or current investors
  or customers may elect to invest or do business with our competitors instead. Even if this is not the case, our current actions may
  subsequently be determined to be insufficient by various stakeholders, and we may be subject to various adverse consequences
  or investor or regulator engagement on our ESG initiatives and disclosures, even if such initiatives are currently voluntary.

  In addition, we expect there will likely be increasing levels of regulation, disclosure-related and otherwise, with respect to ESG
  matters. For example, the SEC has published proposed rules that require companies to provide significantly expanded climate-
  related disclosures in their periodic reporting, which may require us to incur significant additional costs to comply, including the
  implementation of significant additional internal controls processes and procedures regarding matters that have not been subject
  to such controls in the past, and impose increased oversight obligations on our management and board of directors.
  Furthermore, industry and market practices may further develop to become even more robust than what is required under any
  new laws and regulations, and we may have to expend significant efforts and resources to keep up with market trends and stay
  competitive among our peers, which could result in higher associated compliance costs and penalties for failure to comply with
  such laws and regulations. Additionally, many of our customers and suppliers may be subject to similar expectations, which may
  augment or create additional risks.

  Risks Related to the Ownership of Our Class A Common Stock

  The price of our Class A common stock has been, and may continue to be, volatile or may decline regardless of our operating
  performance.

  The market price of our Class A common stock has fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate significantly in response to numerous
  factors, many of which are beyond our control, including:

       •    actual or anticipated fluctuations in our financial condition and results of operations;
       •    the projections and any other guidance we may provide to the public, and any changes in, or failure to meet, such
            projections or guidance;
       •    failure of securities analysts to maintain coverage of Rivian, changes in financial estimates or ratings by any securities
            analysts who follow Rivian or our failure to meet these estimates or the expectations of investors;
       •    announcements by us or our competitors of significant technical innovations, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint
            ventures, results of operations, or capital commitments;
       •    changes in stock market valuations and operating performance of other EV companies generally, or those in our industry
            in particular;
       •    price and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market, including as a result of trends in the economy as a whole;
       •    significant changes in our board of directors or management;
       •    sales of large blocks of our common stock, including sales by our Founder, our executive officers and directors or
            investors;
       •    lawsuits threatened or filed against us;
       •    actual or anticipated changes in laws, regulations or government policies applicable to our business;
       •    changes in our capital structure, such as future issuances of debt or equity securities;
       •    short sales, hedging and other derivative transactions involving our capital stock;
       •    general economic conditions, such as recessions, changes in inflation or interest rates and slow or negative growth of our
            markets;
       •    other events or factors, including those resulting from war, geopolitical tensions such as the ongoing military conflict
            between Russia and the Ukraine and related economic sanctions, pandemics (including COVID-19 and associated
            variants), incidents of terrorism or responses to these events; and
       •    the other factors described in this Part I Item 1A. “Risk Factors”.

  The stock market in general, and the market for technology companies and EV companies in particular, has experienced extreme
  price and volume fluctuations, which in many cases have been unrelated or disproportionate to the results of operations of those
  companies. Market fluctuations could result in extreme volatility in the price of shares of our Class A common stock, which could
  cause a decline in the value of a stockholder’s investment. Price volatility may be greater if the public float and trading volume of
  shares of our Class A common stock is low. Following periods of such volatility in the market price of a company’s securities,
  securities class action litigation has often been brought against that company. Such litigation could result in substantial costs and
  divert management’s attention and resources from our business.

  Our executive officers, directors, and principal stockholders, if they choose to act together, maintain significant voting power.

  Our executive officers, directors, and stockholders who own more than 5% of our outstanding common stock and their respective
  affiliates, in the aggregate, hold shares representing approximately 53.7% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock
  and are able to significantly influence all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, as well as our management and
  affairs, particularly if they were to choose to act together. For example, these persons, if they choose to act together, would
  control or significantly influence the election of directors and approval of any merger, consolidation, or sale of substantially all of
  our assets, regardless of whether or not other stockholders believe that such action is in their best interest. This concentration of
  ownership control may:

       •    delay or prevent a change in control;
       •    entrench our management and our board of directors; or
       •    impede a merger, consolidation, takeover, or other business combination involving us that other stockholders may
            desire.




                                                                    42

26/04/23, 09:03                                                          rivn-20221231

                                                    RIVIAN AUTOMOTIVE, INC.



  In addition, each share of our Class B common stock is entitled to ten votes, while each share of our Class A common stock
  entitles its holder to one vote. An affiliate of our Founder and CEO, Robert J. Scaringe, holds all outstanding shares of our Class B
  common stock. Due to our dual class structure, affiliates of Dr. Scaringe hold shares of our common stock representing, in the
  aggregate, approximately 9.3% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock but 2.5% of the total shares of common stock
  outstanding.

  In addition, while we do not expect to issue any additional shares of Class B common stock, any future issuances of Class B
  common stock would be dilutive to holders of Class A common stock.

  We cannot predict the impact our dual class structure may have on the market price of our Class A common stock.

  We cannot predict whether our dual class structure will result in a lower or more volatile market price of our Class A common
  stock, in adverse publicity, or in other adverse consequences. Certain index providers, such as S&P Dow Jones, exclude companies
  with multiple class share structures in certain of their indices, including the S&P 500. As a result, our dual class capital structure
  makes us ineligible for inclusion in any of these indices. Given the sustained flow of investment funds into passive strategies that
  seek to track certain indices, exclusion from stock indices would likely preclude investment by many of these funds and could
  make our Class A common stock less attractive to other investors. As a result, the market price of our Class A common stock could
  be materially adversely affected.

  Sales, directly or indirectly, of a substantial amount of our Class A common stock in the public markets by our existing security
  holders may cause the price of our Class A common stock to decline.

  Sales of a substantial number of shares of our Class A common stock into the public market, particularly sales by our directors,
  executive officers and principal stockholders, or the perception that these sales might occur, could cause the market price of our
  Class A common stock to decline. Many of our pre-IPO security holders have substantial unrecognized gains on the value of the
  equity they hold, and may take steps to sell their shares or otherwise secure or limit their risk exposure to the value of their
  unrecognized gains on those shares. We are unable to predict the timing or effect of such sales on the market price of our Class A
  common stock.

  We and all of our directors and executive officers and certain other record holders are able to sell our shares freely in the public
  market, except that any shares held by our affiliates, as defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act, would only be able to be
  sold in compliance with Rule 144. In addition, as of December 31, 2022, we had stock options and restricted stock units (“RSUs”)
  outstanding, as well as other stock-based awards and shares underlying our 2021 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”) that, if
  fully exercised, vested, or settled, would result in the issuance of approximately 109 million shares of Class A common stock. All of
  the shares of Class A common stock issuable upon the exercise of stock options, and the shares reserved for future issuance
  under our equity incentive plans, are registered for public resale under the Securities Act. Accordingly, these shares can be freely
  sold in the public market upon issuance subject to applicable vesting requirements, compliance by affiliates with Rule 144, and
  other restrictions provided under the terms of the applicable plan and/or the award agreements entered into with participants
  and any such sales could adversely affect the market price of our Class A common stock.

  Further, in September 2022, we approved the payment of 2022 bonus awards to be made under the 2021 Incentive Award Plan in
  the form of stock-based awards, which will vest immediately upon grant in the first quarter of 2023. The 2022 bonus objectives
  were subject to certain performance conditions related to production and other targets. We expect these grants to be made on
  or about March 6, 2023 in an aggregate amount of approximately $139 million in the form of stock-based awards. Our issuance of
  additional shares of common stock will dilute the ownership interests of our existing common stockholders, which may depress
  the trading price of our Class A common stock.

  In addition, certain holders of shares of our common stock have rights after the completion of our IPO, subject to certain
  conditions, to require us to file registration statements for the public resale of shares of our Class A common stock or to include
  such shares in registration statements that we may file for us or other stockholders.

  If securities or industry analysts do not publish research, or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research, about our business, the
  price of our Class A common stock and trading volume could decline.

  The trading market for our Class A common stock will depend in part on the research and reports that securities or industry
  analysts publish about us or our business, our market and our competitors. We do not have any control over these analysts. If one
  or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our Class A common stock or publish inaccurate or unfavorable

  research about our business, or if our results fall short of the projected results published by one or more of the analysts, our Class
  A common stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of us or fail to publish reports on us
  regularly, we could lose visibility in the financial markets and demand for our Class A common stock could decrease, which might
  cause our Class A common stock price and trading volume to decline.

  We do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future. Consequently, any gains from an investment in our common
  stock will likely depend on whether the price of our Class A common stock increases.

  We currently intend to retain any future earnings to finance the operation and expansion of our business and we do not expect to
  declare or pay any dividends in the foreseeable future. Any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion
  of the board of directors. As a result, stockholders must rely on sales of their Class A common stock after price appreciation,
  which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on their investment. Moreover, the terms of our ABL Facility
  and the indenture governing the 2026 Notes restrict the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to pay dividends to us, and any
  additional debt we may incur in the future may restrict our ability to declare or pay cash dividends or make distributions. In
  addition, Delaware law may impose requirements that may restrict our ability to pay dividends to holders of our Class A common
  stock.

  Anti-takeover provisions contained in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated
  bylaws, as well as provisions of Delaware law, could impair a takeover attempt.

  Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, amended and restated bylaws and Delaware law contain provisions which
  could have the effect of rendering more difficult, delaying, or preventing an acquisition. These provisions include:

       •    a dual class structure;
       •    a classified board of directors with three-year staggered terms, who can only be removed for cause, which may delay the
            ability of stockholders to change the membership of a majority of our board of directors;
       •    no cumulative voting in the election of directors, which limits the ability of minority stockholders to elect director
            candidates;
       •    the exclusive right of our board of directors to set the size of the board of directors and to elect a director to fill a
            vacancy, however occurring, including by an expansion of the board of directors, which prevents stockholders from being
            able to fill vacancies on our board of directors;
       •    the ability of our board of directors to authorize the issuance of shares of preferred stock and to determine the price and
            other terms of those shares, including voting or other rights or preferences, without stockholder approval, which could
            be used to significantly dilute the ownership of a hostile acquiror;
       •    the ability of our board of directors to alter our amended and restated bylaws without obtaining stockholder approval;
       •    in addition to our board of director’s ability to adopt, amend, or repeal our amended and restated bylaws, our
            stockholders may adopt, amend, or repeal our amended and restated bylaws only with the affirmative vote of the
            holders of at least 66 2/3% of the voting power of all our then outstanding shares of capital stock;
       •    the required approval of (i) at least 66 2/3% of the voting power of the outstanding shares of capital stock entitled to
            vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class, to adopt, amend, or repeal certain provisions
            of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and (ii) for so long as any shares of Class B common stock are
            outstanding, the holders of at least 80% of the shares of Class B common stock outstanding at the time of such vote,
            voting as a separate series, to adopt, amend, or repeal certain provisions of our amended and restated certificate of
            incorporation;
       •    a prohibition on stockholder action by written consent, which forces stockholder action to be taken at an annual or
            special meeting of stockholders;
       •    the requirement that a special meeting of stockholders may be called only by an officer of the Company pursuant to a
            resolution adopted by a majority of our board of directors then in office or the chairperson of our board of directors; and
       •    advance notice procedures that stockholders must comply with in order to nominate candidates to our board of
            directors or to propose matters to be acted upon at a stockholders’ meeting, which may discourage or deter a potential
            acquiror from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquiror’s own slate of directors or otherwise attempting
            to obtain control of us.

  These provisions, alone or together, could delay or prevent hostile takeovers and changes in control or changes in our
  management. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for stockholders to elect




                                                                    44

  directors of their choosing and to cause us to take other corporate actions they desire, any of which, under certain circumstances,
  could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our Class A common stock, and could
  also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our Class A common stock.

  As a Delaware corporation, we are also subject to provisions of Delaware law, including Section 203 of the Delaware General
  Corporation Law (the “DGCL”), which prevents some stockholders holding more than 15% of our outstanding common stock from
  engaging in certain business combinations without approval of the holders of substantially all of our outstanding common stock.

  Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the
  sole and exclusive forum for certain stockholder litigation matters and the federal district courts of the United States shall be
  the exclusive forum for the resolution of any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act, which could
  limit our stockholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, employees or
  stockholders.

  Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that, unless we otherwise consent in writing, the Court of
  Chancery of the State of Delaware is the exclusive forum (or if such court does not have subject matter jurisdiction, the federal
  district court of the State of Delaware) for any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, any action asserting a claim
  of breach of a fiduciary duty, any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL, our amended and
  restated certificate of incorporation or our amended and restated bylaws or as to which the DGCL confers exclusive jurisdiction on
  the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine of the law
  of the State of Delaware. This provision would not apply to claims seeking to enforce any liability or duty created by the Exchange
  Act. Furthermore, Section 22 of the Securities Act creates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all suits
  brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Securities Act or the rules and regulations thereunder. Accordingly, both
  state and federal courts have jurisdiction to entertain such claims. To prevent having to litigate claims in multiple jurisdictions and
  the threat of inconsistent or contrary rulings by different courts, among other considerations, our amended and restated
  certificate of incorporation provides that the federal district courts of the United States will be the exclusive forum for resolving
  any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act. While the Delaware courts have determined that such
  choice of forum provisions are facially valid, a stockholder may nevertheless seek to bring a claim in a venue other than those
  designated in the exclusive forum provisions. In such instances, we would expect to vigorously assert the validity and
  enforceability of our exclusive forum provisions.

  The choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for
  disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors,
  officers, and other employees. Alternatively, if a court were to find the choice of forum provision contained in our amended and
  restated certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated
  with litigating such action in another jurisdiction, which could harm our business, prospects, financial condition, results of
  operations, and cash flows.

  General Risk Factors

  Our business is subject to the risk of earthquakes, fire, power outages, floods, other natural disasters, the physical effects of
  climate change and other catastrophic events, and to interruption by man-made events such as terrorism.

  Our business is vulnerable to damage or interruption from power losses, telecommunications failures, terrorist attacks, acts of
  war, electronic and physical break-ins, natural disasters and the acute physical effects of climate change, which may include more
  frequent or severe storms, hurricanes, floods, droughts and wildfires, and other similar events. Climate change may also result in
  chronic changes in physical conditions such as sea-level rise or changes in temperature or precipitation patterns, which may also
  result in adverse impacts on our business. The third-party systems and operations and suppliers and service providers we rely on
  are subject to similar risks. If a significant natural disaster, such as an earthquake, fire, or flood occurs, or our information
  technology systems or communications networks break down or operate improperly, our facilities may be seriously damaged or
  we may have to stop or delay production and delivery of our vehicles, which could have an adverse effect on our business,
  prospects, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows, and our insurance coverage may be insufficient to
  compensate us for losses that may occur. Acts of terrorism, which may be targeted at metropolitan areas that have higher
  population density than rural areas, could also cause disruptions in our or our suppliers’ and service providers’ businesses or the
  economy as a whole. We may not have sufficient protection or recovery plans in some circumstances, such as natural disasters
  affecting locations that store significant inventory of our products,and in

  certain situations market responses to climate change and other catastrophic events may impair our ability to acquire insurance
  on terms that we find acceptable, which may augment the impact of any such events. Because we depend on single or limited
  source suppliers in some instances, any damage or interruption to our or our suppliers’ facilities could have a significant impact
  on our business or financial condition. Any prolonged disruption of operations at our manufacturing facility or our suppliers’
  facilities, whether due to technical, information systems, communication networks, strikes, accidents, weather conditions or
  other natural disasters, including as a result of climate change, the COVID-19 pandemic or otherwise, whether short- or long-
  term, would materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.

  Our insurance strategy may not be adequate to protect us from all business risks.

  Our insurance strategy is to maintain insurance coverage for various types of risks, including property, products liability, casualty,
  management liability, cyber liability, and other risks similar to other companies with our risk profile that are normal and
  customary and available in the current insurance market. We place our insurance coverage with various carriers in numerous
  jurisdictions. The types and amounts of insurance we carry may vary from time to time and limits and retentions vary depending
  on availability, cost, and our decisions with respect to risk retention. These insurance policies are subject to various deductibles,
  policy limits, and exclusions that may impact our ability to recover for a specific risk. We may only insure to meet contractual
  requirements and/or choose to retain a level of risk where we believe we can adequately self-insure against the anticipated
  exposure. Losses that are not covered by insurance may be substantial and/or unpredictable and could adversely affect our
  financial condition and results of operations. Further, insurance coverage may not continue to be available to us or, if available,
  may be at a significantly higher cost, based on insurance market conditions or a change in our risk profile. This may require a
  change in our insurance purchasing philosophy and strategy which can result in the assumption of greater risks to offset
  insurance market fluctuations.

  General business and economic conditions could reduce our orders and sales, which could have a material adverse effect on
  our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.

  Our business and results of operations may be subject to global economic conditions and their impact on customer discretionary
  spending. Some factors that may negatively influence customer spending include high levels of unemployment, higher customer
  debt levels, declines in asset values and related market uncertainty, rising inflation, fluctuating interest rates and credit
  availability, availability of vehicle financing, fluctuating fuel and other energy costs, and national and global geo-political and
  economic uncertainty, including in connection with tariffs or trade laws. Economic conditions in certain regions may also be
  affected by natural disasters, such as earthquakes, hurricanes, tropical storms and wildfires, public health crises, political crises,
  such as terrorist attacks, war or other political instability or other unexpected events, and such events could also disrupt our
  operations, internet or mobile networks or the operations of one or more of our third-party suppliers or providers. Specifically,
  difficult macroeconomic conditions, such as decreases in per capita income and level of disposable income, increased and
  prolonged unemployment, or a decline in consumer confidence could have a material adverse effect on the demand for our
  vehicles and more broadly on the automotive industry. Under difficult economic conditions, potential customers may seek to
  reduce spending by forgoing our vehicles for other traditional options, increase use of public and mass transportation options or
  may choose to keep their existing vehicles, and cancel preorders.

  We have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. If our remediation of such material
  weaknesses is not effective, or if we experience additional material weaknesses in the future or otherwise fail to develop and
  maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, our ability to produce timely and accurate financial statements or
  comply with applicable laws and regulations could be impaired, which could adversely affect investor confidence in the
  accuracy and completeness of our financial statements and adversely affect our business and operating results and the market
  price for our Class A common stock.

  As a public company, we are required to establish and periodically evaluate procedures with respect to our disclosure controls
  and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting. In the course of preparing our financial statements for fiscal year
  2021, we identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. A material weakness is a deficiency, or
  combination of deficiencies, in our internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a
  material misstatement of our annual or interim consolidated financial statements would not be prevented or detected on a
  timely basis. The material weaknesses previously identified pertained to controls to address access and segregation of duties
  across financially relevant functions and IT general controls over our Enterprise Resource Planning systems, applications, and
  tools used in financial reporting. During the preparation of our financial statements for fiscal year 2022, we concluded that the
  material weaknesses previously identified had not been remediated and continued to exist as of December 31, 2022 as disclosed
  in Part II, Item 9A "Controls and Procedures".

  While the control deficiencies described above did not result in a material misstatement to our financial statements, the control
  deficiencies created a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement to our consolidated financial statements would not be
  prevented or detected on a timely basis. Therefore, we concluded that the deficiencies represent material weaknesses in our
  internal control over financial reporting and our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of December 31,
  2022. In addition, our independent registered public accounting firm issued an adverse opinion indicating that our internal
  control over financial reporting was not effective as of December 31, 2022. We have taken and will continue to take action to
  remediate these material weaknesses, as described in Part II, Item 9A “Controls and Procedures.” However, we will not be able to
  fully remediate these material weaknesses until these steps have been completed and have been operating effectively for a
  sufficient period of time.

  Furthermore, we cannot assure you that the measures we have taken to date, and actions we may take in the future, will be
  sufficient to remediate the control deficiencies that led to our material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting
  or that they will be effective in preventing or mitigating potential future material weaknesses. Our current controls and any new
  controls that we develop may become inadequate because of changes in conditions in our business. Further, additional
  weaknesses in our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting may be discovered in the
  future. If we are unable to remediate the material weaknesses in a timely manner and further implement and maintain effective
  internal control over financial reporting or disclosure controls and procedures, our ability to record, process, and report financial
  information accurately, and to prepare financial statements within required time periods could be adversely affected, which could
  result in material misstatements in our financial statements that may continue undetected or a restatement of our financial
  statements for prior periods. This may negatively impact the public perception of the Company and cause investors to lose
  confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which could negatively affect the market price of our Class
  A common stock, harm our ability to raise capital on favorable terms, or at all, in the future, and subject us to litigation or
  investigations by regulatory authorities, which could require additional financial and management resources or otherwise have a
  negative impact on our financial condition.

  In addition, we have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant expenses and devote substantial management effort
  toward our efforts to achieve and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting. As a result of the complexity
  involved in complying with the rules and regulations applicable to public companies, our management’s attention may be
  diverted from other business concerns, which could harm our business, operating results, and financial condition. Although we
  have already hired additional employees to assist us in complying with these requirements, we may not have adequate personnel
  with the appropriate level of knowledge, experience and training in the accounting policies, practices, or internal control over
  financial reporting required of public companies and may need to hire more employees in the future, or engage outside
  consultants, which will increase our operating expenses. As a result, the development and implementation of the standards and
  controls necessary to achieve the level of accounting standards required of a public company may require costs greater than
  expected or take longer to achieve.

  We will continue to incur significant additional costs as a public company, and our management will be required to devote
  substantial time to compliance with our public company responsibilities and corporate governance practices.

  We have incurred and will continue to incur increased costs associated with reporting and corporate governance rules and
  regulations for public companies. These rules and regulations have increased and may continue to evolve and are expected to
  significantly increase our accounting, legal and financial compliance costs and have made and will continue to make some
  activities more time consuming, including due to increased training of our current employees, additional hiring of new
  employees, and increased assistance from consultants. In addition, our executive officers have limited experience in the
  management of a publicly traded company and will need to devote substantial attention to complying with the increasingly
  complex laws pertaining to public companies and interacting with public company analysts and investors, which may divert
  attention away from the day-to-day management and growth of our business, including operational, research and development
  and sales and marketing activities, which may adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations,
  and cash flows. We also expect public company rules, regulations and oversight to make it more expensive for us to maintain
  directors’ and officers’ liability insurance and we may be required to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur
  substantially higher costs to maintain the same or similar coverage. As a result, it may be more difficult for us to attract and retain
  qualified persons to serve on our board of directors or as executive officers.

  If our estimates or judgments relating to our critical accounting policies are based on assumptions that change or prove to be
  incorrect, our results of operations could fall below the expectations of our investors and securities analysts, resulting in a
  decline in the trading price of our Class A common stock.

  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“U.S.
  GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial
  statements and accompanying notes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we
  believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, as discussed in Part II, Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
  Financial Condition and Results of Operations” included elsewhere in this Form 10-K, the results of which form the basis for
  making judgments about the carrying values of assets, liabilities, equity and expenses that are not readily apparent from other
  sources. Our results of operations may be adversely affected if our assumptions change or if actual circumstances differ from
  those in our assumptions, which could cause our results of operations to fall below our publicly announced guidance or the
  expectations of securities analysts and investors, resulting in a decline in the market price of our Class A common stock.

  Item 2. Properties

  Rivian is based in Southern California. Our principal facilities include leased properties in Northern California, Michigan, Arizona,
  Vancouver, Serbia, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom that are used for engineering, research and development, design,
  customer engagement, sales, and administrative activities. Our footprint includes 51 service center locations leased and owned
  across 23 states in the United States and three additional countries, of which 28 are in operation. We also own an approximately
  4.5 million square foot engineering, manufacturing, and assembly facility in the Normal Factory with the capacity to produce up
  to 150,000 vehicles annually. Our facilities are suitable and adequate for the conduct of our business.

  Item 3. Legal Proceedings

  Currently we are involved in, or may in the future be involved in, legal proceedings, claims or government investigations in the
  ordinary course of business relating to, among other things, commercial matters and contracts, intellectual property, labor and
  employment, discrimination, false or misleading advertising, regulatory matters, competition, pricing, tax, consumer
  rights/protection, torts/personal injury, real estate matters, property rights, data privacy/data protection, and securities.

  These matters also include the following:

       •    On July 17, 2020, Tesla, Inc. (“Tesla”) filed suit against Rivian Automotive, Inc., Rivian Automotive, LLC and a number of
            former Tesla/current Rivian group employees in California Superior Court, Santa Clara County. The current operative
            pleading, the Fourth Amended Complaint (“4AC”) filed on September 28, 2021, alleges claims for trade secret
            misappropriation against Rivian and various individual defendants, as well as breach of contract and California Computer
            Data Access and Fraud Act claims against the individual defendants (but not against Rivian). Tesla alleges that the
            individual defendants took confidential and trade secret documents and information at Rivian’s direction when they left
            Tesla’s employ to join Rivian, including recruitment and personnel information, sales data, service data, manufacturing
            information, new market expansion information, and documents and code relating to battery technology. Tesla also
            alleges that by doing so, the individual defendants breached their non-disclosure and other agreements with Tesla. The
            4AC seeks damages, injunctive relief and attorneys’ fees, among other things. We believe Tesla’s claims are meritless and
            intend to vigorously defend against this lawsuit.

       •    Between March 7, 2022 and April 19, 2022, three alleged stockholders filed lawsuits against Rivian Automotive, Inc.,
            certain of our officers and directors, and Rivian’s IPO underwriters on behalf of a putative class of purchasers of Rivian
            common stock in our IPO. The three suits were consolidated under the caption Crews v. Rivian Automotive, Inc., et al.
            22-cv-01524-RGK-E (C.D. Cal.). On July 22, 2022 the lead plaintiff filed an amended consolidated complaint alleging
            violations of Sections 11, 12(a)(2) and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act

            the Rivian defendants and the underwriter defendants’ motions to dismiss were granted with leave to amend. We
            believe the alleged stockholders’ claims are meritless and intend to vigorously defend against this lawsuit.

       •    On July 8, 2022, the State of Georgia filed a petition with the Morgan County (Georgia) Superior Court to validate $15
            billion in revenue bonds that would establish the financing structure that is necessary for the provision of certain
            incentives for Rivian’s planned manufacturing site in Georgia. In its petition, the State claims that the bonds are
            authorized under the laws of the State of Georgia and the procedural and substantive requirements for bond validation
            have been met, and as such, the State seeks bond validation. The Court denied the petition by Order dated September
            29, 2022. The State filed a Notice of Appeal on October 28, 2022. Oral argument on the appeal was held on February 15,
            2023 and the parties are awaiting a decision from the Court of Appeals.

       •    On October 21, 2022, five individuals filed a Petition for Writ of Mandamus and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive
            Relief in Morgan County (Georgia) Superior Court against six Morgan County officials, the Joint Development Authority
            of Jasper County, et al. and Plateau Excavation. The lawsuit seeks Writs of Mandamus and declaratory and injunctive
            relief related to the property where the planned manufacturing plant of Rivian Horizon, LLC (“Rivian Horizon”), an
            indirect subsidiary of the Company, is to be located. The lawsuit alleges that the proposed development of the property
            is not a permitted use, an allowable conditional use or exempt from regulation and thus is not permissible under the
            applicable zoning laws, ordinances and regulations. Although Rivian Horizon was not a party to the lawsuit nor were any
            of its direct or indirect parents or subsidiaries, there was a possibility that Rivian Horizon could have become a party to
            the proceedings or that the suit or its outcome could have affected the timing and/or construction of the planned
            manufacturing plant in Georgia. Plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed their Complaint without prejudice on December 7, 2022
            and the Court closed this case by Order dated January 10, 2023.

       •    On January 27, 2023, six individuals filed a Complaint in Morgan County (Georgia) Superior Court against Morgan County,
            Georgia. The lawsuit seeks declaratory and injunctive relief related to the property where Rivian Horizon’s planned
            manufacturing plant is to be located. More specifically, it seeks a declaratory judgment that the property, and Rivian
            Horizon’s proposed project thereon, is subject to local and state zoning laws and an injunction compelling Morgan
            County to enforce the zoning laws. On January 31, 2023, the same plaintiffs filed a Complaint in Fulton County (Georgia)
            Superior Court against the State of Georgia. The lawsuit seeks declaratory and injunctive relief related to the property
            where Rivian Horizon’s planned manufacturing plant is to be located. More specifically, it seeks a declaratory judgment
            that the property, and Rivian Horizon’s proposed project thereon, is subject to local and state zoning laws and an
            injunction (1) compelling the State to enforce the zoning laws, and (2) enjoining the State (and its groups/agencies) from
            taking further action on this project until the zoning laws are complied with. Although Rivian Horizon is not a party to
            either of these lawsuits nor are any of its direct or indirect parents or subsidiaries, there is a possibility that Rivian
            Horizon could become a party to the proceedings or that these suits or their outcomes could affect the timing and/or
            construction of the planned manufacturing plant in Georgia.

  While it is not possible to predict the outcome of these matters with certainty, based on our current knowledge, we do not
  believe that the final outcome of these pending matters is likely to have a material adverse effect on our business, results of
  operations, or financial condition.

  Notwithstanding this belief, there is always the risk that a proceeding, claim or investigation will have a material impact on our
  business, results of operations or financial condition. Regardless of the final outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us
  due to defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources, harm to our reputation and brand, and other factors.

  Item 5. Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities

  Market Information

  Rivian Automotive, Inc. (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, “Rivian” or the “Company”), Class A common stock has been
  traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol “RIVN” since November 10, 2021. Prior to that date, there was no
  public trading market for our Class A common stock.

  Our Class B common stock is not listed or traded on any stock exchange.

  Holders

  As of February 14, 2023, there were approximately 74 shareholders of record of our Class A common stock and one shareholder
  of record of our Class B common stock. The number of beneficial owners is substantially greater than the number of shareholders
  of record because a large portion of our Class A common stock is held in “street name” by brokers, banks, and other financial
  institutions.

  Dividend Policy

  We have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain all available funds and
  future earnings, if any, for the operation and expansion of our business and do not anticipate declaring or paying any dividends in
  the foreseeable future. Our operations are generally conducted through our subsidiaries, and accordingly, our ability to pay
  dividends to our stockholders will be dependent on the earnings and distributions of funds from these subsidiaries. Covenants in
  the ABL Facility and the indenture governing the 2026 Notes are material restrictions on the ability of certain of our subsidiaries
  to pay dividends to us, and we may enter into credit agreements or other borrowing arrangements in the future that restrict our
  ability to declare or pay cash dividends or make distributions in the future. Any future determination related to our dividend
  policy will be made at the discretion of our board of directors after considering our financial condition, results of operations,
  capital requirements, contractual requirements, business prospects and other factors the board of directors deems relevant, and
  subject to the restrictions contained in any future financing instruments and applicable law.

  Use of Proceeds

  On November 15, 2021, we completed our IPO. The net proceeds to us from the IPO were $13.5 billion, after deducting the
  underwriting discount and commissions of approximately $185 million. All shares sold were registered pursuant to a registration
  statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333-259992), as amended, which was declared effective by the SEC on November 9, 2021.

  The net proceeds from our IPO have been invested in investment grade instruments. There has been no material change in the
  use of proceeds from our IPO as described in our final prospectus.

  Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

  The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the
  consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking
  statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from
  those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those set forth under Part I, Item
  1A. “Risk Factors” or in other parts of this Form 10-K. Our historical results are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be
  expected for any period in the future. The discussion of our financial condition and results of operations for the year ended
  December 31, 2020 is included in Part II, Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
  Operations” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021.

  Overview

  Rivian exists to create products and services that help our planet transition to carbon neutral energy and transportation. Rivian
  designs, develops, and manufactures category-defining EVs and accessories and sells them directly to customers in the consumer
  and commercial markets. Rivian complements its vehicles with a full suite of proprietary, value-added services that address the
  entire lifecycle of the vehicle and deepen its customer relationships.

  In the consumer market, we launched the R1 platform with our first generation of consumer vehicles: the R1T, a two-row, five-
  passenger pickup truck, and the R1S, a three-row, seven-passenger SUV.

  In the commercial market, we launched the RCV platform. Our first vehicle on this platform is our EDV, designed and engineered
  by Rivian in collaboration with Amazon, our first commercial customer. Amazon has placed an initial order of 100,000 EDVs,
  subject to modification.

  During the year ended December 31, 2022, we produced 24,337 vehicles and delivered 20,332 vehicles.

  Factors Affecting Our Performance

  The growth and future success of our business depends on many factors. While these factors present significant opportunities for
  our business, they also pose risks and challenges, including those discussed below and in Part I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors,” that we
  must successfully address to achieve growth, improve our results of operations, and generate profits.

       •    Ability to Develop and Launch New Offerings. The R1T, R1S, and EDV appear to resonate with customers based on
            positive responses to vehicles delivered and preorder data. We believe the Rivian brand is becoming established in the
            most attractive consumer and commercial vehicle market segments. However, our ability to grow revenue and expand
            margins will also depend on our ability to develop and launch new vehicle platforms and programs. Our future financial
            performance will also depend on our ability to offer services that deliver an intuitive, seamless, and compelling customer
            experience.

       •    Ability to Attract New Customers. Our growth will depend in large part on our ability to attract new consumer and
            commercial customers. We have invested heavily in developing our ecosystem and plan to continue to do so. We are in
            the very early stages of growth in our existing markets, and we expect to substantially raise brand awareness by
            connecting directly with our community through engaging content, rich digital experiences, and immersive events. We
            anticipate that these activities will lead to additional preorders and deliveries, and, as a result, increase our base of
            Rivian customers. An inability to attract new customers would substantially impact our ability to grow revenue or
            improve our financial results.

       •    Ability to Scale our Ecosystem and Brand Experience. Our go-to-market strategy requires us to scale our ecosystem
            quickly and effectively, including our technology platform and product development and operational infrastructure. Our
            future success will also depend on our ability to further develop and leverage our proprietary technology platform. Our
            ability to enhance our product design, engineering, and manufacturing capabilities and expand our production capacity,
            delivery and service operations, Rivian Adventure Network, charging network, and customer service will be critical for
            supporting growth. We believe our long-term ability to achieve our financial targets will depend on our ability to cost-
            effectively scale these elements, while also delivering a unified customer and brand experience consistent with our
            adventurous brand commitment.

26/04/23, 09:03                                                          rivn-20221231

                                                    RIVIAN AUTOMOTIVE, INC.



       •    Ability to Convert our Customers to Subscribers of our Services. Services are a key part of our growth strategy. We offer
            a variety of services, including financing and insurance, vehicle maintenance and repair, charging, and FleetOS solutions
            that we believe will grow our revenue outside of vehicle sales. As we increase our base of Rivian customers and expand
            our services portfolio, we expect our customers to expand their usage of our service offerings over the full lifecycle of
            their vehicle ownership. We believe the services portion of our business will have the benefit of creating a higher-
            margin, recurring revenue stream for each vehicle, therefore improving our margin profile. Our ability to grow revenue
            and our long-term financial performance will depend in part on our ability to drive adoption of these offerings.

       •    Ability to Invest in our Production and Capabilities. We believe that customer acquisition and retention is contingent on
            our ability to produce innovative offerings, including vehicles that deliver the broadest combination of performance,
            utility, and capability, as well as services that enhance the ownership journey through new features, functions, and a
            best-in-class customer experience. To this end, we intend to continue making investments to drive growth as we scale
            vehicle production and deliveries, expand our offerings, and strengthen our core capabilities. As we invest in our
            business for long-term growth, leading to increases in operating expenses as well as capital expenditures, we expect to
            experience additional losses, which could delay our ability to achieve profitability and positive operating cash flow.
            Furthermore, we anticipate that these future investments will require significant external debt and/or equity financing.

       •    Ability to Develop and Manage a Resilient Supply Chain. Our ability to manufacture vehicles and develop future
            solutions is dependent on the continued supply of input materials (e.g., lithium and nickel) and product components
            (e.g., semiconductors). Any inability or unwillingness of our suppliers to deliver necessary input materials or product
            components at timing, prices, quality, and volumes that are acceptable to us could have a material impact on our
            business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. Fluctuations in the cost of input materials
            or product components and supply interruptions or shortages could materially impact our business. We have
            experienced and may continue to experience cost fluctuations and disruptions in supply of input materials and product
            components that could impact our financial performance. For example, the global semiconductor supply shortage has
            had, and is continuing to have, wide-ranging effects across the automotive industry, and has impacted our operations
            and financial performance, along with those of many automotive suppliers and manufacturers that incorporate
            semiconductors into their products. In addition, over the prior year there have been sizable increases in the cost of key
            metals, including lithium, nickel, aluminum, and cobalt. These prices have declined from peak levels but are expected to
            remain volatile for the foreseeable future. We have also experienced a need for expedited freight associated with supply
            chain challenges, resulting in higher logistics costs. Given the current supply chain environment, we believe our
            production ramp and rate in our Normal Factory will be limited by supply chain factors in the near-future. We also must
            manage the risk of field service actions, including product recalls, with respect to components from suppliers. We
            continue to work diligently and collaboratively with suppliers to identify and proactively address problems or constraints
            as quickly as possible.

       •    Ability to Grow in New Geographies. We plan to invest in international operations and grow our business outside of our
            existing operations. We believe we are well-positioned for international expansion in light of healthy global demand for
            EVs and for the vehicle segments in which we currently or expect to operate. Other factors that we believe will aid our
            successful international growth include: the highly flexible, modular nature of our platforms, which we anticipate will
            provide us the ability to introduce new vehicle programs and configurations; our digital-first approach, which we
            anticipate will allow us to expand quickly and without a significant physical retail footprint; and our product
            development expertise, which we anticipate will enable us to offer significant customization for diverse international
            markets and demographics.

            Our international expansion has significant associated investment requirements, such as capital spending related to
            infrastructure, including additional manufacturing capacity, delivery, and service operations, charging networks, and
            personnel. International expansion is also subject to a variety of risks, including local competition, multilingual customer
            support and servicing, delivery logistics, and compliance with foreign laws and regulations related to vehicle sales, data
            privacy, financing, taxes, labor and employment, and foreign exchange.

       •    Ability to Maintain Our Culture, Attract and Retain Talent, and Scale Our Team. We believe our culture has been a key
            contributor to the positive response from our customers, and our mission promotes a sense of greater purpose and
            fulfillment in our employees. We have invested in building a strong culture and believe it is one of our most important
            and sustainable sources of competitive advantage. Any failure to preserve our culture could negatively

            affect our ability to retain and recruit personnel, which is critical to our growth, and to effectively pursue our objectives.
            If we are unable to retain or hire key personnel, our business and competitive position may be harmed resulting in an
            adverse impact to our prospects, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.

       •    Seasonality. Historically, the automotive industry has experienced higher revenue in the spring and summer months.
            Additionally, we expect volumes of commercial vehicle sales to be less in the winter months, as customers shift their
            focus to making last mile deliveries during holidays, rather than incorporating more vehicles into their fleet. We do not
            expect such seasonality in demand to significantly impact our operations in the near-term as we scale our business due
            to our backlog of preorders; however, we may experience seasonal variations in our business in the long-term.

       •    Inflation. The United States economy has experienced various disruptions, including supply chain shortages. These
            disruptions, as well as the ongoing military conflict between Russia and the Ukraine, have contributed to increased
            inflation. The cost of input materials (e.g., lithium and nickel) and product components (e.g., semiconductors) required
            to produce our vehicles has risen considerably over the past year. If we are unable to fully offset higher costs through
            price increases or other measures, especially in the near-term as we continue to work through the backlog of preorders,
            we could experience an adverse impact to our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations, and cash
            flows.

  Components of Operating Results

  We expect to incur significant operating costs and expenses that will impact our future profitability, including research and
  development (“R&D”) expenses as we develop and introduce new vehicles and services and improve our existing vehicles and
  services, capital expenditures in the expansion of our manufacturing footprint and operations, additional operating costs and
  expenses for production ramp-up, raw material procurement costs, servicing, and warranty costs as we expand our deliveries,
  general and administrative expenses as we scale our operations, and selling and distribution expenses as we market our vehicles
  and services. Our ability to become profitable in the future will depend on our ability not only to successfully market and sell our
  vehicles and services at prices we establish, but also to appropriately control costs and realize economies of scale.

  Revenues and Cost of revenues

  Vehicle production and deliveries began in September 2021. The majority of our revenues is derived from sales of consumer and
  commercial vehicles. The majority of our costs of revenues is driven by direct parts, material and labor costs, manufacturing
  overhead (e.g., depreciation of machinery and tooling), shipping and logistics costs, and reserves including for estimated warranty
  costs related to the production of consumer and commercial vehicles, adjustments to write down the carrying value of inventory
  when it exceeds its estimated net realizable value (“NRV”), losses on firm purchase commitments, and to adjust for excess and
  obsolete inventory based upon expectations of forecasted demand. Additionally, we started recognizing recurring non-cash stock
  compensation charges in the quarter ended December 31, 2021 in connection with the performance-based vesting condition of
  RSUs and stock options being met upon the IPO.

  Operating expenses

  Research and development

  Our R&D cost consists primarily of expenses incurred for the development of our vehicles and related technologies. These
  expenses include:

       •    personnel expenses for teams in engineering and research;
       •    prototyping expenses;
       •    consulting and contractor expenses;
       •    depreciation expenses; and
       •    allocation of indirect expenses.

  Additionally, we started recognizing recurring non-cash stock compensation charges in the quarter ended December 31, 2021 in
  connection with the performance-based vesting condition of RSUs and stock options being met upon the IPO.

  Selling, general, and administrative

  Selling, general, and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses consist primarily of personnel costs for employees in our sales, service,
  facilities, corporate, executive, finance, and other administrative functions, as well as outside professional services, including
  legal, accounting, and audit services. Personnel costs consist of salaries and wages, benefits, and employment taxes. Additionally,
  we started recognizing recurring non-cash stock compensation charges in the quarter ended December 31, 2021 in connection
  with the performance-based vesting condition of RSUs and stock options being met upon the IPO. SG&A expenses also include
  allocated facilities expenses such as rent and depreciation, and other general corporate expenses such as travel and recruiting
  expenses.

  Other expenses

  Other expenses consist of charitable contributions to Forever by Rivian.

  Other income (expense), net

  Other income (expense), net consists primarily of non-operating expenses and income such as interest expense, amortization of
  debt discounts and issuance costs, and other gains or losses associated with our debt financing arrangements, as well as interest
  income earned on investments.

  Provision for income taxes

  Our provision for income taxes consists primarily of income taxes related to foreign jurisdictions in which we do business. We
  maintain a full valuation allowance on our United States federal and state deferred tax assets as we have concluded that it is
  more likely than not that the deferred assets will not be utilized.

  For the year ended December 31, 2022, we incurred cost of revenues of $4,781 million, including $475 million of depreciation
  and amortization expense. Cost of revenues increased compared to the year ended December 31, 2021 as a result of the
  increased production and delivery of 23,322 and 19,412 vehicles, respectively. Additionally, we had a $920 million charge to
  reflect the lower of cost or net realizable value (“LCNRV”) of inventory and losses on firm purchase commitments as of
  December 31, 2022 compared to a $95 million as of December 31, 2021 for an increase of $825 million, increased depreciation
  and amortization expense by $371 million, and increased stock-based compensation expense by $44 million.

  We expect to continue to incur LCNRV charges and losses on firm purchase commitments in the near-term but anticipate that the
  total charge associated with our Normal Factory will decline over the course of 2023 and 2024 as we lower material, production,
  logistics, and other costs and increase production volumes. The increase in LCNRV charges and losses on firm purchase
  commitments compared to the previous period is primarily due to an increase in overall inventory and firm purchase
  commitment values as production ramps, which were adjusted to reflect the amount we anticipate receiving upon vehicle sale
  (after considering future costs necessary to ready the inventory for sale).

  There have been sizable increases in the cost of various inputs to manufacture our products over the past year, due to inflationary
  pressures and supply chain disruptions, impacting items such as the cost of input materials (e.g., lithium and nickel) and
  components (e.g., semiconductors). We have also incurred higher indirect costs, such as elevated levels of expedited freight and
  short-term premiums on materials, to compensate for certain supply chain challenges which we expect will continue in the near-
  term. In addition, our total cost of goods sold was negatively impacted by the ramping of our second manufacturing shift.

  Negative gross profit increased for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to the year ended December 31, 2021 primarily
  due to the items noted above. As we produce vehicles at low volumes on production lines designed for higher volumes, we have
  experienced, and will continue to experience, negative gross profit driven by labor, depreciation, and overhead costs. The
  pressure on gross profit from limited volumes will continue in the near-term, but we expect it will improve on a per-vehicle basis
  as we implement new in-vehicle technologies, achieve commercial cost savings on material costs, and ramp our overall
  production levels.

  million increase in payroll and related expenses, a $160 million increase in stock-based compensation expense, a $43 million
  increase in depreciation and amortization, and a $33 million increase in software expenses partially offset by a $362 million
  decrease in engineering, design, and development costs.

  The primary drivers for these higher expenses were higher headcount and personnel costs related to investing in our R1 and RCV
  programs as well as investments related to other advanced product development activities, including early development of our
  R2 platform, future propulsion platforms, and our updated vehicle network architecture. The decrease in engineering, design, and
  development costs were related to higher product development activities in the lead up to our start of production for the R1 and
  RCV platforms in the prior period.

  We plan to continue investing in future vehicle platforms and new in-vehicle technologies as well as furthering vertical integration
  of manufacturing.

  For the year ended December 31, 2022, we incurred SG&A expenses of $1,789 million, including $82 million of depreciation and
  amortization expense. SG&A expenses increased compared to the year ended December 31, 2021 primarily due to a $213 million
  increase in stock-based compensation expense and a $208 million increase in payroll and related expenses.

  The primary drivers for these higher expenses were scaling our corporate functions and commercial operations, including
  customer-facing facilities to support our current and future business growth. These expenses include higher headcount and
  personnel costs.

  We also plan to make corresponding investments in our facilities, commercial operations, and technology for our future
  operations.

  Other expenses decreased for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021 as a result of
  the Company’s donation of approximately 8 million shares of Class A common stock and $20 million in cash to Forever by Rivian
  in 2021. With this sizable initial funding, we have no near-term plans to provide additional direct funding to Forever by Rivian in
  the future.

  Interest income increased for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021 primarily due
  to higher interest rates and higher average balances of cash and cash equivalents.

  Interest expense increased for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021 primarily due
  to higher average debt balances and interest rates resulting from the 2026 Notes. See Note 7 “Debt” to our consolidated financial
  statements included in this Form 10-K for more information on the 2026 Notes. We expect interest expense to increase in the
  near term, reflecting changes in the interest rate environment.

  Loss on convertible notes, net decreased for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021
  as a result of the issuance and subsequent mark-to-market valuation of the unsecured senior convertible promissory notes due
  July 2026 (“2021 Convertible Notes”) in 2021. See Note 7 “Debt” to our consolidated financial statements included in this Form
  10-K for more information on the 2021 Convertible Notes.

  Provision for income taxes

  As of December 31, 2021 and 2022, the majority of our deferred tax assets were comprised of net operating losses generated
  primarily in the United States and tax credit carryforwards, and for all periods, these assets were fully offset by a valuation
  allowance.

  Liquidity and Capital Resources

  Our operations have been financed primarily through net proceeds from the sale of securities, including in our IPO, and from
  borrowings. The following table summarizes our liquidity (in billions):

                                                                                              December 31, 2021        December 31, 2022

  In May 2021, we entered into the ABL Facility, which will mature on May 20, 2025. As of December 31, 2022, we had $0.3 billion
  of unused committed amounts under the ABL Facility. The ABL Facility contains certain affirmative and negative covenants,
  including a minimum liquidity covenant requiring us to maintain no less than $1.0 billion of liquidity, which will fall away upon
  meeting a fixed charge coverage ratio of greater than 1.0 for two consecutive quarters, and conditions to borrowing or taking
  other actions that restrict certain of our subsidiaries’ ability to, among other things, incur debt, grant liens, make investments,
  enter into certain transactions with affiliates, pay dividends, and prepay junior or unsecured indebtedness, subject to certain
  exceptions. As of December 31, 2022, we were in compliance with the covenants and conditions of the ABL Facility. See Note 7
  “Debt” to our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K for more information regarding the ABL Facility.

  In October 2021, we issued $1.25 billion aggregate principal amount of 2026 Notes. The 2026 Notes have a maturity of five years
  from the date of their original issuance. The 2026 Notes require certain of our subsidiaries to comply with a number of customary
  covenants (including restrictions on incurrence of indebtedness, liens, the making of restricted payments, and dispositions), in
  each case substantially similar to the corresponding covenants under the ABL Facility as described above. In addition, the 2026
  Notes contain the same minimum liquidity covenant (but no other financial covenants) as the ABL Facility described above. See
  Note 7 “Debt” to our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K for more information regarding the 2026
  Notes.

  In November 2021, we completed our underwritten IPO of approximately 176 million shares of Class A common stock at a public
  offering price of $78.00 per share, which included the exercise in full by the underwriters of their option to purchase from
  approximately 23 million additional shares of Class A common stock. The net proceeds to us from the IPO were $13.5 billion. See
  Note 12 “Stockholders' Equity” to our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K for more information
  regarding the IPO.

  We have generated significant losses from operations, as reflected in our accumulated deficit of $6.4 billion and $13.1 billion as of
  December 31, 2021 and 2022, respectively. Additionally, we have generated significant negative cash flows from operations and
  investing activities as we continue to support the growth of our business. We anticipate continuing to make

  significant capital investments over the next several years to focus on ramping up production as we strategically expand
  infrastructure, including additional manufacturing capacity both domestically and internationally. We also anticipate continuing to
  make significant investments in future growth objectives, including vehicle and other technology and software, tooling for current
  vehicle platforms, future vehicle manufacturing lines, battery technology and supply, and our service network.

  As of December 31, 2021 and 2022, our non-cancellable commitments as disclosed in Note 6 "Leases", Note 7 “Debt”, and Note
  13 "Commitments and Contingencies" to our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K, do not include any
  commitments related to these ongoing investments as we do not have any related material commitments that we cannot cancel
  without a significant penalty. In addition to our capital expenditures, we expect our operating expenses to increase as we ramp
  vehicle production and continue to invest in R&D activities and our commercial infrastructure in support of our growing customer
  base.

  We believe our existing balance of cash and cash equivalents, in addition to amounts available for borrowing under the ABL
  Facility, will be sufficient to meet our operating expenses, working capital, and capital expenditure needs for at least the next 12
  months.

  Our future operating losses and capital requirements may vary materially from those currently planned and will depend on many
  factors, including our rate of revenue growth, the timing and extent of spending on R&D efforts and other growth initiatives, the
  timing, nature, and rate of expansion of manufacturing activities, the timing of new products and services, market acceptance of
  our offerings, and overall economic conditions. Furthermore, we anticipate that future investments will require significant debt
  and/or equity financing. The sale of additional equity would result in dilution to our stockholders. The incurrence of additional
  debt would result in debt service obligations, and the instruments governing such debt could provide for operational and financial
  covenants that restrict our operations. There can be no assurances that we will be able to raise additional capital on favorable
  terms or at all. The inability to raise capital would adversely affect our ability to achieve our business objectives.

  Operating Activities
  Net cash used in operating activities increased during the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December
  31, 2021. This increase was primarily driven by higher cash outlays to support overall growth of the business, especially the
  manufacturing and sale of our products from our Normal Factory and building up inventory to support our increasing production
  levels.

  Investing Activities

  Net cash used in investing activities decreased during the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December
  31, 2021, primarily due to higher capital expenditures related to the build-out of our manufacturing capabilities at our Normal
  Factory in the prior year. We continued to invest in the growth of our business at our Normal Factory, our next generation vehicle
  platforms and technologies, along with our service centers in the current year.

  Financing Activities

  Net cash provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2021 was primarily driven by $13.5 billion in net
  proceeds from our IPO, $2.7 billion in proceeds from the issuance of shares of Series F contingently redeemable convertible
  preferred stock, $2.5 billion in proceeds from the issuance of the 2021 Convertible Notes, and $1.2 billion in net

  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

  The preparation of our financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. GAAP and the discussion and analysis
  of our financial condition and operating results require us to make judgments, assumptions, and estimates that affect the
  amounts reported. We base these estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believe are
  appropriate and reasonable under the circumstances and apply judgement to possible outcomes as the basis for amounts
  reported. Because of the inherent uncertainties involved in making such estimates, actual results may differ, and such differences
  may be material.

  We consider the following policies and estimates critical because they are important to the portrayal of our financial condition
  and operating results, and they require us to make judgments and estimates about inherently uncertain matters. For further
  information on all of our significant accounting policies, see Note 2 “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” to our
  consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K.

  Inventory Valuation

  We review our inventory to ensure that its carrying value does not exceed its NRV, with NRV based on the estimated selling price
  of inventory in the ordinary course of business, less estimated costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. When our
  expectations indicate that the carrying value of inventory may exceed its NRV, we perform an exercise to calculate the
  approximate amount by which carrying value is greater than NRV and record additional cost of revenue for the difference. Once a
  write-off occurs, a new, lower cost basis is established. We also regularly monitor inventory quantities on orders for which we
  have a firm purchase commitment, consistent with our method for valuing inventory.

  Should our estimates used in these calculations change in the future, such as estimated selling prices or remaining costs,
  additional write-downs may occur. The increase in inventory write-downs for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared
  December 31, 2021 is primarily due to an increase in overall inventory and firm purchase commitment values as production
  ramps, which were adjusted to reflect the amount we anticipate receiving upon vehicle sale (after considering future costs
  necessary to ready the inventory for sale). A hypothetical 10% change in estimated selling prices or remaining costs would have
  resulted in the following approximate changes in the inventory write-down for the year ended December 31, 2022.

                                                  Decrease in                                                           Increase in

  See Note 3 "New Accounting Standards" to our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K for a description of
  recently adopted accounting pronouncements and recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted.

  Emerging Growth Company Status

  We ceased to be an “emerging growth company,” as defined in the JOBS Act, as of October 8, 2021 due to our issuance, in a
  three-year period, of more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities. As a result, we have not applied the extended
  transition period for new or revised accounting standards beginning with our consolidated financial statements and related notes
  for the year ended December 31, 2021.

  three months or less. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes. However, some of our investments
  are exposed to market risk due to fluctuations in interest rates which may affect our interest income and the fair market value of
  our investments. Due to the short-term nature of our investment portfolio, we do not believe a hypothetical 100 basis point
  increase or decrease in interest rates would have a material effect on the fair market value of our portfolio.

  We are exposed to interest rate risk on our borrowings that bear interest at floating rates. A rising interest rate environment
  would increase the amount of interest paid on these borrowings. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates on our

                                       Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm


  To the Stockholders and Board of Directors
  Rivian Automotive, Inc.:

  Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements
  We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Rivian Automotive, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of
  December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive loss, changes in contingently
  redeemable convertible preferred stock and stockholders’ (deficit) equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year
  period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the
  consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31,
  2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended
  December 31, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

  We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)
  (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in
  Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
  Commission, and our report dated February 28, 2023 expressed an adverse opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s
  internal control over financial reporting.

  Basis for Opinion
  These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an
  opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the
  PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and
  the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

  We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the
  audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement,
  whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the
  consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such
  procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial
  statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management,
  as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a
  reasonable basis for our opinion.

  Critical Audit Matter
  The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial
  statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or
  disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or
  complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated
  financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate
  opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.

       Sufficiency of audit evidence
       As discussed in Item 9A. Controls and Procedures, material weaknesses were identified as of December 31, 2022 and
       included in management’s report on internal control over financial reporting. The description of the material weaknesses
       states that the Company’s risk assessment process was not effective in implementing controls on a timely basis in response
       to changes to the business operations, personnel and other factors affecting certain financial reporting processes and related
       information technology systems. As a result, the Company had ineffective information technology general controls (ITGCs)
       related to certain systems, applications, and tools used for financial reporting; and the Company did not establish effective
       user access and segregation of duties controls across financially relevant functions. Therefore, the automated and manual
       process level controls over financial reporting which were dependent upon these ITGCs could not be relied upon. As of
       December 31, 2021, material weaknesses were identified and described in management’s assessment as being related to
       controls to address segregation of duties across financially relevant functions and ITGCs over enterprise resource planning
       systems, applications, and tools used in financial reporting.

       We identified the evaluation of the sufficiency of audit evidence as a critical audit matter. Evaluating the sufficiency of audit
       evidence obtained required especially subjective auditor judgment because of the pervasiveness of the material weaknesses
       noted above.

       The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We applied auditor judgment to
       determine the nature and extent of procedures to be performed over financial statement account balances and we:

       •    obtained and inspected the Company’s remediation plan to address the prior year material weaknesses that had been
            identified

       •    increased the number of sample selections compared to what we would have otherwise made if the Company’s controls
            were designed and operating effectively

       •    tested the underlying records of selected transaction data obtained from the impacted information technology systems
            to support the use of the information in the conduct of the audit

       •    inspected supporting documentation and evidence of authorization for a selection of manual and automated journal
            entries.

       We evaluated the sufficiency of audit evidence obtained by assessing the results of procedures performed, including the
       appropriateness of the nature and extent of such evidence.

  We have served as the Company’s auditor since 2021.

                                       Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm


  To the Stockholders and Board of Directors
  Rivian Automotive, Inc.:

  Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
  We have audited Rivian Automotive, Inc. and subsidiaries’ (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of
  December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of
  Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. In our opinion, because of the effect of the material weaknesses,
  described below, on the achievement of the objectives of the control criteria, the Company has not maintained effective internal
  control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework
  (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

  We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)
  (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated
  statements of operations, comprehensive loss, changes in contingently redeemable convertible preferred stock and stockholders’
  (deficit) equity, and cash flows for each of the year in a three-year period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes
  (collectively, the consolidated financial statements), and our report dated February 28, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion on
  those consolidated financial statements.

  A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combinations of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there
  is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be
  prevented or detected on a timely basis. The following material weaknesses have been identified and included in management’s
  assessment. The Company’s risk assessment process was not effective in implementing controls on a timely basis in response to
  changes to the business operations, personnel and other factors affecting certain financial reporting processes and related
  information technology systems. As a result, the Company had ineffective information technology general controls (ITGCs) related
  to certain systems, applications, and tools used for financial reporting; and the Company did not establish effective user access
  and segregation of duties controls across financially relevant functions. Therefore, the automated and manual process level
  controls over financial reporting which were dependent on these ITGCs could not be relied upon. The material weaknesses were
  considered in determining the nature, timing, and extent of audit tests applied in our audit of the 2022 consolidated financial
  statements, and this report does not affect our report on those consolidated financial statements.

  Basis for Opinion
  The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its
  assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report
  on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over
  financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be
  independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and
  regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

  We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the
  audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all
  material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control
  over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating
  effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we
  considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

  Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
  A Company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
  reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally
  accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that
  (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions
  of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation
  of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and




                                                                    65

26/04/23, 09:03                                                          rivn-20221231




  that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and
  directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
  acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

  Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,
  projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate
  because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

  1. PRESENTATION AND NATURE OF OPERATIONS

  Description and Organization

  Rivian Automotive, Inc. (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, “Rivian” or the “Company”), was incorporated as a Delaware
  corporation on March 26, 2015. Rivian was formed for the purpose of designing, developing, manufacturing, and selling category-
  defining electric vehicles (“EVs”), accessories, and related services directly to customers in the consumer and commercial
  markets. The nature of the Company’s operations during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2021 was primarily research
  and development activities related to vehicle development and its related technologies, and pre-production activities related to
  manufacturing and sales. The nature of the Company’s operations during the year ended December 31, 2022 was primarily the
  production and sale of EVs in the United States of America (“United States”).

  Segment Information

  The Company’s Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) has been identified as the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”). As the CODM
  reviews financial information presented on a consolidated basis for purposes of making operating decisions, allocating resources,
  and evaluating financial performance, the Company has determined that it operates in one operating segment and one
  reportable segment.

  Basis of Presentation

  The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting
  principles in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”) and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission
  (“SEC”) regarding annual financial information. The accompanying consolidated financial statements, in the opinion of
  management, reflect all normal recurring adjustments necessary to fairly present the financial position, results of operations,
  cash flows, and change in equity for the periods presented. Certain amounts in the prior period consolidated financial statements
  have been aggregated to conform to current period presentation.

  Basis of Consolidation

  The Company consolidates entities in which it has a controlling financial interest. Intercompany balances and transactions have
  been eliminated in consolidation.

  Initial Public Offering

  In November 2021, the Company completed its underwritten initial public offering (“IPO”) of approximately 176 million shares of
  Class A common stock at a public offering price of $78.00 per share, which included the exercise in full by the underwriters of
  their option to purchase approximately 23 million additional shares of Class A common stock. The net proceeds to the Company
  from the IPO were $13,530 million. See Note 12 “Stockholders’ Equity” for more information regarding the IPO.

  2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

  For each accounting topic that is addressed in a separate footnote, the description of the accounting policy can be found in the
  related footnote. Other significant accounting policies are described below.

  Use of Estimates

  Accounting estimates are an integral part of the consolidated financial statements. These estimates require the use of judgments
  and assumptions that may affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses in the periods presented.
  Estimates are used for, but not limited to, inventory valuation, property, plant, and equipment, warranty reserves, leases, income
  taxes, stock-based compensation, and commitments and contingencies. The Company believes that the accounting estimates and
  related assumptions employed by the Company are appropriate and the resulting balances are

  reasonable under the circumstances. However, due to the inherent uncertainties involved in making estimates, the actual results
  could differ from the original estimates, requiring adjustments to these amounts in future periods.

  Cash and Cash Equivalents

  Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, cash in banks, and short-term, highly liquid investments with maturities of three
  months or less. The Company’s cash equivalents are measured at fair value and classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy
  because they are valued using observable inputs that reflect quoted prices in active markets for identical instruments. The cost of
  the Company’s cash equivalents approximated their fair values as of December 31, 2021 and 2022. The following table presents
  the fair value of the Company’s “Cash and cash equivalents” on the Consolidated Balance Sheets (in millions):

  Restricted Cash

  Cash and cash equivalents that are restricted as to withdrawal or use under the terms of certain contractual agreements are
  classified as restricted cash and are recorded primarily in “Other non-current assets” on the Company’s Consolidated Balance
  Sheets. Restricted cash primarily consists of the balance of an account under the dominion and control of the administrative
  agent under the senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility (“ABL Facility”). See Note 7 “Debt” for more information on
  the ABL Facility. Total restricted cash was $290 million and $531 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2022, respectively.

  Accounts Receivable, Net

  Accounts receivable primarily consist of amounts due from customers from the sale of EVs and are reported at the invoiced
  amount, less an allowance for any potential uncollectible amounts. The Company’s allowance for uncollectible amounts was not
  material as of December 31, 2022.

  Derivative Instruments

  In the normal course of business, the Company is exposed to global market risks, including the effect of changes in certain
  commodity prices, interest rates, and foreign currency exchange rates, and may enter into derivative contracts, such as forwards,
  options, swaps, or other instruments, to manage these risks. Derivative instruments are recorded on the Consolidated Balance
  Sheets in either Other current assets or Current portion of lease liabilities and other current liabilities and are measured at fair
  value. They are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy because they are valued using observable inputs other than
  quoted prices in active markets. For commodity contracts, the Company records gains and losses resulting from changes in fair
  value in “Cost of revenues” in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and cash flows in “Cash flows from operating activities”
  in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The Company also may enter into master netting agreements with its
  counterparties to allow for netting of transactions with the same counterparty. The Company does not utilize derivative
  instruments for trading or speculative purposes.

  The Company has entered into commodity contracts and the resulting asset, liability, and aggregate notional amount is not
  material as of December 31, 2022. These derivatives are economic hedges used to manage overall price risk and have not been
  designated as hedging instruments. During the year ended December 31, 2022, losses resulting from changes in fair value were
  not material.

  Revenues

  The Company’s revenues primarily include revenue from the sale of EVs and specific services that meet the definition of a
  performance obligation, including over-the-air (“OTA”) vehicle software updates. Revenue from the sale of EVs is recognized at a
  point in time when control transfers to the customer, which generally occurs upon delivery. Payment for EV sales is typically
  received at or prior to delivery or according to payment terms customary to the business. Sales tax is excluded from the
  measurement of the transaction price. As the OTA vehicle software updates represent a stand ready obligation to provide these
  services, revenue related to OTA vehicle software updates is recognized ratably throughout the performance period, beginning
  when control of the vehicle is transferred to the customer and continuing through the estimated useful life of the EV. The
  standalone selling prices of performance obligations are estimated by considering costs to develop and deliver the good or
  service, third-party pricing of similar goods or services, and other available information. The transaction price is allocated among
  the performance obligations in proportion to the standalone selling prices.

  Contract Liabilities

  The Company recognizes contract liabilities when payments are received or due before the related performance obligation is
  satisfied. The Company’s contract liabilities are primarily related to payments for vehicles collected prior to delivery of the EV,
  generally satisfied within one quarter or less, and OTA vehicle software updates. The Company’s contract liabilities exclude fully-
  refundable customer deposits. The Company’s contract liabilities as of December 31, 2021 and 2022 were not material and were
  recorded in “Current portion of lease liabilities and other current liabilities” and “Other non-current liabilities” on the
  Consolidated Balance Sheets.

  Cost of Revenues

  Cost of revenues primarily relates to the cost of EVs and includes direct parts, material and labor costs, manufacturing overhead
  (e.g., depreciation of machinery and tooling), shipping and logistics costs, and reserves including for estimated warranty costs
  related to the production of consumer and commercial vehicles, adjustments to write down the carrying value of inventory when
  it exceeds its estimated net realizable value (“NRV”), losses on firm purchase commitments, and to adjust for excess and obsolete
  inventory based upon expectations of forecasted demand. Additionally, we started recognizing recurring non-cash stock
  compensation charges in the quarter ended December 31, 2021 in connection with the performance-based vesting condition of
  RSUs and stock options being met upon the IPO.

  Product Warranty and Field Service Actions

  The Company provides a product warranty on new consumer vehicles. The estimated costs related to product warranties include
  management’s estimate of the cost of materials, labor, and other costs to facilitate warranty claims. These costs are accrued
  when probable that a liability has been incurred and the related amount can be reasonably estimated, which is generally at the
  time vehicles are sold or once a specific field service action has been approved and is announced. These estimates are established
  based on an analysis of relevant benchmark data and historical information on the nature, frequency, and average cost of actual
  claims incurred to date and future assumptions by vehicle model. Revisions are made when necessary and are based on changes
  in these estimates. Due to the uncertainty and potential volatility of the factors contributing to developing estimates for product
  warranties and field service actions, changes in these estimates could materially affect the warranty reserve. The Company’s
  warranty reserve as of December 31, 2022 was approximately $100 million and was recorded in “Current portion of lease
  liabilities and other current liabilities” and “Other non-current liabilities” on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

  Concentration of Risk

  Counterparty Credit Risk

  Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentration of counterparty credit risk consist of cash and cash
  equivalents, restricted cash, customer deposits, derivative instruments, and debt. We are exposed to credit risk to the extent that
  the Company’s cash balance with a financial institution is in excess of Federal Deposit Insurance Company insurance limits. The
  degree of counterparty credit risk will vary based on many factors including the duration of the transaction and the contractual
  terms of the agreement. Management evaluates and approves credit standards and oversees

                                          NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS



  the credit risk management function related to investments. As of December 31, 2021 and 2022, all of the Company’s cash, cash
  equivalents, and restricted cash were placed at financial institutions that management believes are of high credit quality. These
  amounts are typically in excess of insured limits. In addition, the counterparties to the Company’s derivative instruments are
  financial institutions that management believes are of high credit quality.

  Supply Risk

  The Company is subject to risks related to its dependence on its suppliers, the majority of which are single-source providers of
  parts or components for the Company’s products. Any inability or unwillingness of the Company’s suppliers to deliver necessary
  input materials or product components, including semiconductors, at timing, prices, quality, and volumes that are acceptable to
  the Company could have a material impact on Rivian’s business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations, and cash
  flows. Fluctuations in the cost of input materials or product components and supply interruptions or shortages could materially
  impact the Company’s business.

  Impairment of Long-Lived Assets (Held-and-Used Long-Lived Assets)

  The Company reviews property, plant, and equipment and finite-lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or
  changes in circumstances occur that indicate that the carrying amount of an asset group may not be fully recoverable. Events that
  trigger a test for recoverability include material adverse changes in projected revenues and expenses, present cash flow losses
  combined with a history of cash flow losses or a forecast that demonstrates significant continuing losses, significant negative
  industry or economic trends, a current expectation that a long-lived asset group will be disposed of significantly before the end of
  its useful life, a significant adverse change in the manner in which an asset group is used or in its physical condition, or when
  there is a change in the asset grouping. When an indicator of impairment is present, the Company assesses the risk of
  impairment based on an estimate of the undiscounted cash flows at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows exist against
  the carrying value of the asset group. Impairment exists when the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the estimated future
  undiscounted cash flows generated by those assets. The Company records an impairment charge for the difference between the
  carrying value of the asset group and its estimated fair market value. Depending on the asset, estimated fair market value may be
  determined either by use of a discounted cash flow model or by reference to estimated selling values of assets in similar
  condition.

  Fair Value Measurements

  A three-level valuation hierarchy, based upon observable and unobservable inputs, is used for fair value measurements.
  Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect market assumptions
  based on the best evidence available. These two types of inputs create the following fair value hierarchy:

       •    Level 1 – Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets
       •    Level 2 – Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in
            markets that are not active, and model-derived valuations whose significant inputs are observable
       •    Level 3 – Instruments with model-derived valuations whose significant inputs are unobservable

  Employee Benefit Plan

  The Company provides a defined contribution plan for substantially all employees in the United States in which the Company
  provides discretionary matching contributions. The Company made matching contributions to the defined contribution plan for
  the years ended December 31, 2020, 2021 and 2022 which were not material.

  Research and Development Costs

  Research and development (“R&D”) costs consist primarily of personnel costs for teams in engineering and research, prototyping
  expenses, consulting and contractor expenses, amortized equipment costs, and allocation of indirect costs. Most R&D costs are
  expensed as incurred.

  Selling, General, and Administrative

  Advertising costs are recorded in “Selling, general, and administrative” in the Consolidated Statement of Operations as they are
  incurred. The advertising costs recognized during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2021 and 2022 were not material.

  Other Expenses

  Upon the IPO, the Company donated approximately 8 million shares of Class A common stock and $20 million cash to Forever by
  Rivian, Inc., a 501(c)(4) social welfare organization (“Forever by Rivian”). As a result, $663 million was recorded in “Other
  expenses” in the Consolidated Statement of Operations during the year ended December 31, 2021.

  3. NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

  Upcoming Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted

  Accounting Standards Update (“ASU“) 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate
  Reform on Financial Reporting provides optional expedients and exceptions to the accounting for contracts, hedging relationships,
  and other transactions that reference the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) or another reference rate expected to be
  discontinued because of reference rate reform. The expedients and exceptions provided do not apply to contract modifications
  made and most hedging relationships entered into or evaluated after December 31, 2024. The Company expects to adopt the
  provisions of the ASU as of the beginning of any interim period in which LIBOR is discontinued from the Company’s transactions
  that reference LIBOR. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of the ASU on the consolidated financial
  statements.

  4. INVENTORY AND INVENTORY VALUATION

  Inventory is stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value (“LCNRV”) and consists of raw materials, work in progress, finished
  goods, and service parts. The Company primarily calculates inventory value using standard cost, which approximates actual cost
  on the first-in, first-out (“FIFO”) basis. NRV is the estimated selling price of inventory in the ordinary course of business, less
  estimated costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. The Company assesses the valuation of inventory and periodically
  adjusts its value for estimated excess and obsolete inventory based upon expectations of future demand and market conditions,
  as well as damaged or otherwise impaired goods. The following table summarizes the components of “Inventory” on the
  Consolidated Balance Sheets (in millions):

                                                                                             December 31, 2021     December 31, 2022
  Raw materials and work in progress                                                        $              245    $              949
  Finished goods                                                                                             29   $              399
      Total inventory                                                                       $               274   $             1,348


  The Company recorded a $95 million and $582 million charge to reflect the LCNRV of inventory as of December 31, 2021 and
  2022, respectively, in “Cost of revenues” in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Company is obligated to
  make inventory firm purchases commitments during the next year. Losses to reflect the LCNRV on these firm purchase
  commitments as of December 31, 2022 were $338 million in “Cost of revenues” in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of
  Operations and are reflected in the inventory component of “Accrued liabilities” on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Refer to
  Note 8 "Accrued Liabilities" for more information about Accrued liabilities. The increase in these charges is primarily due to an
  increase in overall inventory and firm purchase commitment values as production ramps, which were adjusted to reflect the
  amount we anticipate receiving upon vehicle sale (after considering future costs necessary to ready the inventory for sale).

  5. PROPERTY, PLANT, AND EQUIPMENT, NET

  Property, plant, and equipment are recorded at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and impairments. Costs of routine
  maintenance and repair are expensed when incurred.

  The Company capitalizes certain qualified costs incurred in connection with the development of software used internally. Costs
  incurred during the application development stage are evaluated to determine whether the costs meet the criteria for
  capitalization. Costs related to preliminary project activities and post implementation activities that are not incremental
  upgrades, including maintenance, are expensed as incurred.

  Property, plant, and equipment are primarily depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the
  asset. Land is not depreciated.

  Depreciation and amortization expense was $29 million, $197 million, and $647 million for the years ended December 31, 2020,
  2021 and 2022, respectively.

  6. LEASES

  The Company leases real estate, machinery, equipment, and vehicles under agreements with contractual periods ranging from 1
  month to 15 years. Leases generally contain extension or renewal options, and some leases contain termination options. After
  considering all relevant economic and financial factors, the Company includes periods covered by renewal or extension options
  that are reasonably certain to be exercised in the lease term and excludes periods covered by termination options that are
  reasonably certain to be exercised from the lease term. The Company determines whether a contractual arrangement is or
  contains a lease at inception.

  The Company has lease agreements with lease and non-lease components and has elected to utilize the practical expedient to
  account for lease and non-lease components together as a single combined lease component, with the exception of leases of real
  estate which is comprised of land and buildings. For leases of land and buildings, the Company accounts for each component
  separately based on the relative estimated standalone price of each component. At lease commencement, the Company
  measures the lease liability at the present value of lease payments not yet paid. All variable payments that are not based on a
  market rate or an index (e.g., the Consumer Price Index) are excluded from the measurement of the lease liability and instead are
  recognized as expense when probable the payments will be made. Because the discount rate implicit in the lease is not
  determinable for most leases, the Company determines the appropriate discount rate using the estimated incremental borrowing
  rate for the lease based on the information available at lease commencement. Right-of-use assets are measured at the amount of
  the lease liability, adjusted for prepaid or accrued lease payments, lease incentives, and initial direct costs incurred, as applicable.

  Leases that are economically similar to the purchase of an asset are classified as finance leases. The Company’s carrying value of
  finance leases is not material for all periods reported.

  Lease expense for operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The Company does not recognize
  right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for short-term leases with an original lease term of 12 months or less. Instead, expense
  representing the rent payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term within “Selling, general, and
  administrative” in the Consolidated Statement of Operations.

  Term Facility

  In April 2018, the Company entered into a variable rate Term Facility Agreement for a committed facility to be used towards the
  Company’s operating expenses and capital expenditures (“Term Facility”). In February 2021, the Company paid all outstanding
  amounts related to the Term Facility. Interest on the Term Facility was paid based on LIBOR plus 4.3%. The Company’s obligations
  under the Term Facility were backed by guarantees, including from an affiliate of a stockholder of the Company.

  In connection with the Term Facility Agreement, the Company issued common stock warrants to the affiliate of the stockholder
  on the date thereof. The common stock warrants were classified as a debt issuance cost, recorded as an increase to Additional
  paid-in capital, and subsequently amortized over the periods the Term Facility was outstanding.


  2021 Convertible Notes

  In July 2021, the Company issued $2,500 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior convertible promissory notes
  due July 2026 in a private offering (“2021 Convertible Notes”) and made an irrevocable election to account for the 2021
  Convertible Notes under the Fair Value Option in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification Topic 825, Financial
  Instruments. As a result, the 2021 Convertible Notes were initially recognized as a liability measured at issue-date estimated fair
  value and subsequently re-measured to estimated fair value as of September 30, 2021. The 2021 Convertible Notes accrued
  interest quarterly at a rate of (i) zero percent (0%) from the date of issuance to, and including, June 30, 2022 and (ii) five percent
  (5%) after June 30, 2022. The Company made no cash interest payments on the 2021 Convertible Notes during the year ended
  December 31, 2021.

  Upon the Company’s IPO, the 2021 Convertible Notes converted into 38 million shares of Class A common stock at a conversion
  price equal to $66.30 per share. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the loss on the 2021 Convertible Notes was
  recognized in “Loss on convertible notes, net” in the Consolidated Statement of Operations and was calculated as follows (in

  ABL Facility

  In May 2021, the Company entered into an ABL Facility with a syndicate of banks that may be used for general corporate
  purposes. The ABL Facility is secured by certain current assets of the Company. The ABL Facility provides for a $750 million
  committed secured revolving credit facility with an annual interest rate between 1.25% and 1.75% plus LIBOR that matures

  on May 20, 2025. Availability under the ABL Facility is based on the lesser of the borrowing base and the committed $750 million
  cap and is reduced by borrowings and the issuance of letters of credit which bear a fronting fee of 0.125% plus interest per
  annum. Interest on LIBOR borrowings under the ABL Facility is due at maturity of each LIBOR period, and interest on non-LIBOR
  borrowings under the ABL Facility is due on a quarterly basis. The Company is required to pay a quarterly commitment fee of
  0.25% per annum based on the unused portion of the ABL Facility. The ABL Facility contains certain affirmative and negative
  covenants and conditions to borrowing or taking other actions that restrict certain of the Company’s subsidiaries’ ability to,
  among other things, incur debt, grant liens, make investments, enter into certain transactions with affiliates, pay dividends, and
  prepay junior or unsecured indebtedness, subject to certain exceptions. The covenants include a minimum liquidity requirement
  and fixed charge coverage ratio calculated quarterly. As of December 31, 2022, the Company was in compliance with all
  covenants required by the ABL Facility.

  As of December 31, 2022, the Company had no borrowings under the ABL Facility and $400 million of letters of credit
  outstanding, resulting in availability under the ABL Facility of $343 million after giving effect to the borrowing base and the
  outstanding letters of credit.

  2026 Notes

  In October 2021, the Company issued $1,250 million aggregate principal amount of senior secured floating rate notes due
  October 2026 (“2026 Notes”) to new and existing investors of the Company. Proceeds received, net of a $25 million original issue
  discount (“OID”), may be used for general corporate purposes. The 2026 Notes bear interest at (x) six-month LIBOR, subject to a
  1.00% floor, plus (y) 6.0% per annum, subject to downward adjustment upon certain events, including an IPO. Upon the
  Company’s IPO, the interest rate on the 2026 Notes was adjusted downward and as of December 31, 2022, the contractual
  interest rate on the notes was 10.1%. Interest on the 2026 Notes is paid in cash semi-annually in arrears on April 15 and October
  15 of each year. The Company has the option to redeem the notes at any time at 100% of the principal amount of the 2026
  Notes, plus any applicable premium. The 2026 Notes are secured by a second priority security interest in the same assets in
  which the ABL Facility has a first priority security interest and are guaranteed by certain subsidiaries of the Company. The 2026
  Notes contain a number of customary covenants similar to the covenants under the ABL Facility, including the same minimum
  liquidity covenant. As of December 31, 2022, the Company was in compliance with all covenants required by the 2026 Notes.

  The Company’s 2026 Notes are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy because they are valued using quoted prices in
  markets that are not active. As of December 31, 2021 and 2022, the fair value of the 2026 Notes was $1,250 million and

  9. INCOME TAXES

  Components of Income Taxes

  The Company’s tax rate is generally a function of the tax rates in the jurisdictions in which the Company operates, the relative
  amount of income earned by jurisdiction, and the relative amount of losses or income for which no tax benefit or expense is
  recognized due to a valuation allowance.

  The components of ”Loss before income taxes” in the Consolidated Statements of Operations are as follows (in millions):

                                                                                           Years Ended December 31,
                                                                            2020                     2021                   2022

      Total loss before income taxes                              $                (1,018) $               (4,688) $               (6,748)


  Provisions are made for estimated United States and foreign income taxes which may be incurred on the reversal of the basis
  differences in investments in foreign subsidiaries and corporate joint ventures not deemed to be indefinitely reinvested. Based on
  United States tax regulations, the Company does not anticipate foreign earnings would be subject to United States taxation upon
  repatriation. However, distributions of unremitted foreign earnings would be subject to foreign withholding taxes. The Company
  maintains that all foreign earnings are indefinitely reinvested. Accordingly, provisions have not been made on the Company’s
  basis differences in investments that primarily result from earnings in foreign subsidiaries which are deemed indefinitely
  reinvested. If recorded, the deferred tax liability associated with indefinitely reinvested basis differences would be immaterial to
  the financial statements.

  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the future tax consequences attributable to (i) temporary differences
  that exist between the carrying value of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and (ii) operating loss and tax credit
  carryforwards on a taxing jurisdiction basis. The Company measures deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates that
  will apply in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to be recovered or paid.

  In determining whether a valuation allowance is needed, the Company considers all available evidence, both positive and
  negative. If, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized, a
  valuation allowance is recorded.

  As of December 31, 2022, the Company recorded valuation allowances of $3,325 million for the portion of deferred tax assets
  that is not expected to be realized. The valuation allowance on net deferred tax assets increased by $293 million, $988 million,
  and $1,867 million during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2021 and 2022, respectively. The changes in the valuation
  allowance are primarily due to additional net United States deferred tax assets recognized in the respective years. The Company
  had no releases of valuation allowances for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2022. The Company continues to monitor
  the realizability of the United States deferred tax assets considering multiple factors, including results of operations. The
  Company shall continue maintaining a full valuation allowance on United States deferred tax assets until there is sufficient
  evidence to support the reversal of all or some portion of these allowances. Release of all, or a portion, of the valuation
  allowances would result in the recognition of certain deferred tax assets and a decrease to income tax expense for the period the
  release is recorded.

  The majority of the Company's gross loss carryforwards are generated in the United States. Federal net operating losses (“NOLs”)
  generated by the Company through December 31, 2017 totaling $81 million may be carried forward for 20 years and begin to
  expire in 2035. These NOLs may fully offset taxable income in the year utilized. Under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, federal losses
  generated in tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, totaling $8,992 million, may be carried forward indefinitely; but their
  deduction is limited to 80% of annual taxable income. In addition, the Company has federal and state tax credit carryforwards of
  $363 million that can be carried forward for 20 years and begin to expire in 2039. The NOLs and tax credits are fully offset by a
  valuation allowance. Additionally, the Company has $6,653 million of carryforwards for state NOLs.

  Under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (“Code”), if a corporation undergoes an “ownership change,”
  the corporation’s ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carryforwards and other pre-change tax attributes (such as R&D
  tax credits) to offset its post-change income may be limited. If the Company experiences a greater than 50

  percentage point aggregate change in ownership of certain significant stockholders over a three-year period, a Section 382
  ownership change could be deemed to have occurred. If a Section 382 change occurs, the Company’s future utilization of the
  NOLs and credits as of the ownership change will be subject to an annual limitation under Section 382 of the Code and similar
  state provisions. Such an annual limitation may result in the expiration of NOLs before utilization. Due to previous ownership
  changes experienced by the Company, tax credits are limited in their utilization and the amounts above reflect such adjustment.
  NOLs are not expected to be limited.

  Unrecognized Tax Benefits

  The Company records uncertain tax positions using a two-step process. First; by determining whether it is more likely than not
  that the tax positions will be sustained on the basis of the technical merits of the position, and second; for those tax positions
  that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, by recognizing the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50
  percent likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with the related tax authority. When applicable, the Company includes
  interest and penalties related to income tax matters within the provision for income taxes. The Company had no accrued interest
  or penalties for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2022.

  The Company’s unrecognized tax benefits related to the Company’s United States R&D tax credit for the year ended December
  31, 2022 was not material. Because a full valuation allowance is maintained in the United States, there is no impact to the
  consolidated balance sheet and, if recognized, none of the unrecognized tax benefit would impact the Company’s effective tax
  rate.

  Although it is possible that unrecognized tax benefits may increase or decrease within the next twelve months due to tax
  examination changes or the impact on recognition and measurement considerations related to the results of published tax cases
  or similar activities, we do not anticipate any significant changes to unrecognized tax benefits over the next twelve months.

  The Company is subject to taxation and files income tax returns in the United States federal jurisdiction, plus state and foreign
  jurisdictions. Tax years after 2018 remain open in the Company’s major jurisdictions and are subject to examination by the taxing
  authorities. The Company is not currently under an income tax audit by any taxing authority.

  10. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

  Stock Plans

  The Company's 2015 Long-Term Incentive Plan ("2015 Stock Plan") and 2021 Incentive Award Plan (“2021 Stock Plan” and,
  together, “Stock Plans”) permit the grant of stock options, restricted stock units (“RSUs”), and other stock-based awards to
  employees, non-employee directors, and consultants. The 2021 Stock Plan became effective when the registration statement filed
  in connection with the Company’s IPO became effective. The Company’s stock options have seven- or ten-year contractual terms
  and unvested stock options and RSUs generally are forfeited upon the termination of a grantee’s service. The Company has
  elected to recognize forfeitures as an adjustment to compensation expense for options and RSUs in the same period as the
  forfeitures occur. As of December 31, 2022, 76 million and 146 million shares were reserved for issuance under the 2015 Stock
  Plan and 2021 Stock Plan, respectively.

  Generally, the Company’s stock options vest in annual installments based on a requisite service period of four years of continuous
  service and may contain performance conditions related to production and other targets. Stock options granted under the 2015
  Stock Plan may be exercised only upon the occurrence of a Change in Control (as defined under the 2015 Stock Plan, which
  includes an IPO), which is a performance condition. RSUs generally vest in quarterly installments based on a requisite service
  period of 1 to 4 years of continuous service, upon the later of the quarterly vest date and six months after the occurrence of an
  IPO (as defined under the Stock Plans), which is a performance condition. Achievement of the Change in Control- and IPO-based
  performance conditions of stock options and RSUs granted under the 2015 Stock Plan was not deemed to be probable until such
  events occurred. Therefore, no awards granted under the 2015 Stock Plan vested, were expected to vest, or were exercisable
  prior to the Company’s November 2021 IPO. Accordingly, the Company recognized no stock-based compensation expense prior to
  the IPO. After the IPO, expense is recognized on an accelerated basis for these awards granted prior to the IPO due to the
  performance condition. For awards granted after the IPO, the Company has elected to use the straight-line expense recognition
  on awards with only service conditions.

  In January 2021, the Company granted a stock option covering 27 million shares valued at $241 million to its CEO. A portion of
  the stock option contains only a service condition, which vests over a requisite service period of six years following a Qualified
  IPO (as defined within the award). The other portion of the stock option contains both a service and a market condition, which
  vests in installments based on the achievement of share price goals following a Qualified IPO, measured over a specified period
  ending on the 10th anniversary of the award.

  During June 2021, the Company modified the service-based vesting terms of approximately 17 million RSUs. As achievement of
  the performance condition of the RSUs was not considered probable both before and after the modification, the fair value of the
  RSUs was remeasured on the date of modification, which resulted in an increase in unrecognized stock-based compensation cost
  of approximately $322 million. During October 2021, the Company modified the service-based vesting terms of approximately
  5 million stock options. As achievement of the performance condition of the stock options was not considered probable both
  before and after the modification, the fair value of the stock options was remeasured on the date of modification, which resulted
  in an increase in unrecognized stock-based compensation cost of approximately $275 million.

  In September 2022, the Company approved the payment of 2022 bonus incentives to be made under the 2021 Stock Plan in the
  form of stock-based awards, which will vest immediately upon grant in the first quarter of 2023. The 2022 bonus incentives were
  subject to certain performance conditions related to production and other targets. As of December 31, 2022, the total amount of
  accrued stock-based bonus incentives is $139 million within “Accrued liabilities” on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

  During the year ended December 31, 2020 there was no stock-based compensation expense for the Stock Plans and 2021
  Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”). The following table summarizes Company’s stock-based compensation expense for the

  As of December 31, 2022, the Company’s unrecognized stock-based compensation expense for unvested awards was
  approximately $1,309 million, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 5.7 years for stock options
  and 2.3 years for RSUs.

  Fair Value Assumptions

  The fair value of the stock options granted to the CEO in January 2021 was estimated using a Monte Carlo simulation capturing
  scenarios of the Company's projected stock price over the ten-year time horizon, with the resulting intrinsic value at maturity of
  the stock options in each scenario discounted to present value.

  The assumptions used in the Monte Carlo simulation were as follows:

                                                                                                              Year Ended December 31, 2021

  Dividend yield                                                                                                                          —%
  Risk-free rate                                                                                                                         1.1 %

  The exercise price of all stock options granted during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2021 and 2022 was equal to or greater
  than the fair market value of Rivian's stock at the date of grant. The Company generally estimates the fair value of stock options
  using a Black-Scholes option pricing model. Expected volatility is based on a weighted-average of historical volatility rates of peer
  companies and the Company’s implied volatility. The dividend yield is estimated based on the rate at which the Company expects
  to provide dividends. The risk-free rate is based on the United States Treasury yield curve for zero-coupon Treasury notes with
  maturities approximating the respective expected term of the stock option. The expected term represents the average time the
  Company’s stock options are expected to be outstanding. As the stock options were not exercisable prior to the IPO, the Company
  does not have sufficient historical exercise data to provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate expected term. As a result,
  for stock options, the expected term is estimated based on the weighted-average midpoint of expected vest date and expiration
  date.

  The weighted-average assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option pricing model for stock options granted were as follows:

                                                                                                Years Ended December 31,

  Prior to the Company’s IPO, the stock price input to the estimated fair value of stock options and the fair value of RSUs was
  measured on the grant date (or modification date, if appropriate) based on an independent appraisal of the fair market value




                                                                    84

  of the Company’s common stock. The independent appraisal used a market approach with an adjustment for lack of marketability
  given that the shares underlying the awards were not publicly traded. This assessment required complex and subjective
  judgments regarding the Company’s projected financial results. The appraisal incorporated a backsolve method to the Company’s
  most recent equity issuance and a probability-weighted expected return method “(PWERM)” that estimated equity value in an
  IPO scenario. The fair value of a share of the Company’s common stock was estimated by weighting the backsolve and PWERM
  valuation methods based on the anticipated probability of an IPO as of each valuation date.

  In light of initial information received in estimation of the Company’s IPO price range and the proximity of stock-based awards
  granted from July 20, 2021 to the IPO, the Company established the fair value of a share of the Company’s common stock
  applicable to stock options and RSUs granted from July 20, 2021 onward using a straight-line interpolation from the July 20, 2021
  fair value estimated using an independent appraisal to the midpoint of the initial price range in order to calculate unrecognized
  stock-based compensation expense.

  The grant-date fair value of stock options granted after the IPO is measured using the Black-Scholes option pricing model
  described above. The grant-date fair value of RSUs granted after the IPO is equal to the closing trading price of the Company‘s
  common stock on the grant date.

  Employee Stock Purchase Plan

  In November 2021, the Company adopted the ESPP. The ESPP is designed to allow eligible employees to purchase shares of Class
  A common stock at a 15% discount, generally at intervals of approximately six months, with their accumulated payroll deductions.
  The number of shares of Class A common stock authorized for sale under the ESPP is equal to the sum of (i) 22 million shares of
  Class A common stock and (ii) an annual increase on the first day of each year beginning on January 1, 2022 and ending on
  January 1, 2031, equal to the lesser of (A) 1% of the aggregate number of shares of all classes of common stock outstanding on
  the last day of the immediately preceding year and (B) such smaller number of shares of Class A common stock as determined by
  the board of directors; provided, however, that no more than 185 million shares of Class A common stock may be issued under
  the ESPP. As of December 31, 2022, 28 million shares were reserved for issuance under the ESPP.

  11. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

  Stock Warrants

  In February 2019, the Company entered into a commercial letter agreement with Amazon.com, Inc. and its affiliates (“Amazon”),
  and in September 2019, the entered into a related framework agreement with Amazon Logistics, Inc. (“Logistics”). The Company
  refers to these agreements, together with any work orders, purchase orders, related agreements, and amendments thereunder
  or thereto, collectively, as the “EDV Agreement.” Under the EDV Agreement, the Company and Logistics have agreed to
  collaborate to design, develop, manufacture, and supply EDVs and/or certain component parts and related services for use in
  Amazon’s last mile delivery operations. In connection with the EDV Agreement, the Company provided a share-based sales
  incentive to Amazon, a principal stockholder, in the form of warrants to purchase preferred stock. These were converted to
  warrants to purchase an equivalent number of shares of Class A common stock upon the close of the Company’s IPO. The carrying
  value of the warrants was not material as of December 31, 2021 and 2022 and is amortized as an offset against revenues as
  Electric Delivery Vans (“EDVs”) are sold. The offset against revenues for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2022 was not
  material.

  2021 Convertible Notes

  In July 2021, the Company issued the 2021 Convertible Notes to principal stockholders of the Company at that time, including:

  2026 Notes

  The 2026 Notes were issued to certain new and existing principal stockholders, including T. Rowe Price with an aggregate
  $285 million principal amount (refer to Note 7 "Debt" for more information about the 2026 Notes).

  Revenues

  The Company recorded $343 million in revenues from Amazon for the year ended December 31, 2022, within “Revenues” in the
  Consolidated Statements of Operations, primarily related to the sale of EDVs in accordance with the EDV Agreement. As of
  December 31, 2022, the uncollected amounts related to these revenues in “Accounts receivable, net” on the Consolidated
  Balance Sheets were $60 million.

  Operating Expenses

  The Company obtained prototyping, engineering, and other R&D services from a wholly-owned subsidiary of Ford. Until May
  2022, Ford was a principal stockholder and related party of the Company as a beneficial owner of more than 10 percent of the
  Company’s voting interests. The expense for services from Ford that the Company recognized in “Research and development” in
  the Consolidated Statement of Operations was not material through this time. Ford is no longer a related party.

  The Company obtains data services, including hosting, storage, and compute from Amazon. During the year ended December 31,
  2020, expenses related to these services were not material. During the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2022, expenses
  related to these services of $30 million and $60 million, respectively, were recorded in “Research and development” and “Selling,
  general, and administrative” in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. As of December 31, 2021 and 2022, the unpaid
  amounts related to these services were not material.

  12. STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY

  Initial Public Offering

  In November 2021, the Company completed its IPO of approximately 176 million shares of Class A common stock at a public
  offering price of $78.00 per share, which included the exercise in full by the underwriters of their option to purchase from the
  Company an additional 23 million shares of the Company’s Class A common stock. The net proceeds to the Company from the
  IPO, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by the Company, were
  $13,530 million. Upon the close of the IPO, (i) 102 million shares of common stock outstanding converted into an equal number
  of shares of Class A common stock, (ii) 8 million shares of Class A common stock held by an affiliate of the Company’s CEO were
  exchanged for an equivalent number of shares of Class B common stock, (iii) all outstanding shares of contingently redeemable
  convertible preferred stock converted into an aggregate 576 million shares of Class A common stock, (iv) a warrant outstanding
  for the purchase of 4 million shares of Series C preferred stock, with an exercise price of $9.09 per share, converted to a warrant
  to purchase an equivalent number of shares of Class A common stock, (v) outstanding warrants to purchase fewer than 1 million
  shares of Class A common stock, with a weighted-average exercise price of $5.66 per share, terminated unexercised, and (vi) the
  2021 Convertible Notes converted into 38 million shares of Class A common stock at a conversion price equal to $66.30 per share.
  The Company also amended and restated its certificate of incorporation to (i) authorize the issuance of 3,500 million shares of
  Class A common stock and 8 million shares of Class B common stock and (ii) authorize the issuance of 10 million shares of
  preferred stock.

  Contingently Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock

  Since the preferred stock outstanding prior to the IPO was contingently redeemable upon a Deemed Liquidation Event as defined
  in the Company’s Certificate of Incorporation, it was classified as mezzanine equity prior to the IPO. During the year ended
  December 31, 2020, approximately 161 million shares of Series E contingently redeemable convertible preferred stock were
  issued for $2,500 million. During the year ended December 31, 2021, approximately 72 million shares of Series F contingently
  redeemable convertible preferred stock were issued for $2,650 million.

  Common Stock

  The Company has two classes of common stock: Class A common stock and Class B common stock. Shares of Class A common
  stock and Class B common stock are identical, except with respect to voting and conversion rights. As of December 31, 2021 and
  2022, 892 million and 918 million shares of Class A common stock were issued and outstanding, respectively. As of December 31,
  2021 and 2022, 8 million shares of Class B common stock were issued and outstanding. As of December 31, 2021 and 2022,
  3,500 million shares of Class A common stock and 8 million shares of Class B common stock were authorized.

  Each share of Class A common stock entitles the holder to one vote, and each share of Class B common stock entitles the holder
  to ten votes. Holders of Class A common stock and Class B common stock have the right to receive any dividend declared by the
  Company, subject to the payment of dividends on shares of preferred stock. After the payment in full of all liquidation amounts
  required to be paid to the holders preferred stock, holders of common stock also have the right to receive the remaining property
  of the Company upon the liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of the Company on a pari passu basis among all holders of
  common stock.

  At the option of the holder, shares of Class B common stock are convertible anytime into an equal number of shares of Class A
  common stock. Each outstanding share of Class B common stock will automatically convert into one share of Class A common
  stock upon the earliest to occur of (a) the five-year anniversary the Company’s IPO, (b) the date fixed by the board of directors
  within six months of the death or disability of the Company’s CEO, and (c) the date fixed by the board of directors within six
  months of the date that the number of outstanding shares of Class B common stock held by the Company’s CEO represents less
  than 30% of the shares of Class B common stock outstanding. Any shares of Class B common stock that are no longer owned by
  the Company’s CEO or their affiliates will automatically convert into an equal of shares of Class A common stock upon transfer of
  ownership.

  Stock Warrants

  As of December 31, 2021 and 2022, the Company had 12 million shares of common stock warrants outstanding and exercisable
  with a weighted-average exercise price of $6.84. The weighted-average remaining contractual life of common stock warrants
  outstanding and exercisable as of December 31, 2021 and 2022 is 7 years and 6 years, respectively. There was no activity for the
  year ended December 31, 2022.

  The weighted average grant date fair value of common stock warrants granted during the year ended December 31, 2020 was
  $4.30. There were no common stock warrants granted during the year ended December 31, 2021.

  Fair Value Assumptions

  The Company estimates the fair value of each stock warrant using a Black-Scholes warrant pricing model. Expected volatility is
  based on historical volatility rates of peer companies. The dividend yield is estimated based on the rate at which the Company
  expects to provide dividends. The risk-free rate is based on the United States Treasury yield curve for Treasury Separate Trading of
  Registered Interest and Principal of Securities with maturities approximating each grant’s contractual life.

  The weighted-average assumptions used in the Black-Scholes model for warrants granted were as follows:

                                                                                                                 December 31, 2020

  Dividend yield                                                                                                                 —%

  13. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

  Legal Proceedings

  Liabilities for loss contingencies arising from claims, assessments, litigation, fines and penalties, and other sources are recorded
  within “Accrued liabilities” on the Consolidated Balance Sheets when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the
  related amount can be reasonably estimated. If an amount within the range of loss appears at the time to be a better estimate
  than any other amount within the range, the liability is recorded at that amount. When no amount within the range is a better
  estimate than any other amount, however; the liability is recorded at the minimum amount in the range. If a loss is reasonably
  possible and the amount of the loss or range of loss cannot be reasonably estimated, the Company discloses the nature of the
  possible loss and states that such an estimate cannot be made. Legal costs related to contingencies are recognized as expenses as
  they are incurred.

  The Company is involved in legal proceedings, primarily related to supplier contracts and employment matters. While it is not
  possible to predict the outcome of these matters with certainty, the Company has developed an initial estimate of the range of
  reasonably possible outcomes related to unsettled obligations which, together with the estimated liability, is not material as of
  December 31, 2021 and 2022. The estimated liability is not reduced by expected recoveries from third parties, and the majority
  of the matters for which an estimated obligation has been recorded are expected to be settled during the year ended December
  31, 2023.

  Unconditional Purchase Obligations

  During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company entered into unrecognized commitments that require the future
  purchase of goods or services (“unconditional purchase obligations”). The Company’s unconditional purchase obligations
  primarily relate to inventory purchase requirements and vary by vendor. Future payments under unconditional purchase
  obligations having a remaining term in excess of one year as of December 31, 2022 are as follows (in millions):

                                                                                                                    Future Payments

  Total                                                                                                         $                 204


  14. NET LOSS PER SHARE

  The Company's basic net loss per share is calculated by dividing net loss by the weighted-average number of shares of common
  stock outstanding for the period, after allocating losses to equity awards deemed to be participating securities pursuant to the
  two-class method. Upon completion of the IPO during November 2021, all outstanding shares of common stock and contingently
  redeemable convertible preferred stock automatically converted into an equal number of shares of Class A common stock, and
  approximately 8 million shares of Class A common stock were exchanged for an equivalent number of shares of Class B common
  stock. Except with respect to voting and conversion, the rights, including liquidation and dividend rights, of the holders of Class A
  and Class B common stock are identical (see Note 12 "Stockholders' Equity"). Accordingly, the undistributed earnings are
  allocated on a proportionate basis and as a result, net loss per share attributable to common stockholders is the same for Class A
  and Class B common stock, whether on an individual or combined basis.

  Prior to the IPO, the Company considered shares of contingently redeemable convertible preferred stock to be participating
  securities because they participated in any dividends declared on the Company's common stock on an “if-converted to common
  stock” basis. Holders of contingently redeemable convertible preferred stock did not participate in the net loss per share with
  common stockholders, as they did not have a contractual obligation to share in the Company's losses.

  Diluted net loss per share is computed by giving effect to all potential shares of common stock, to the extent dilutive, including
  stock options, unvested RSUs, shares underlying the Company’s ESPP, stock warrants, and other stock-based awards. Potential
  shares of common stock are excluded from the computation of diluted net loss per share if their effect

  Item 9A. Controls and Procedures

  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

  The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-
  15(e). In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and
  procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control
  objectives, and management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and
  procedures and carries out a variety of ongoing procedures, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s
  management, including the Company’s CEO and CFO, to evaluate the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s
  disclosure controls and procedures.

  Based on that evaluation, our Company’s CEO and CFO concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were
  not effective at the reasonable assurance level as of December 31, 2022 due to the material weaknesses in the Company’s
  internal control over financial reporting, described below.

  Nevertheless, based on the performance of additional procedures by management designed to ensure reliability of financial
  reporting, the Company’s management has concluded that, notwithstanding the material weaknesses described below, the
  consolidated financial statements, included in this Form 10-K, fairly present, in all material respects, the Company’s financial
  position, results of operations, and cash flows as of the dates, and for the periods presented, in conformity with U.S. GAAP.

  Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

  Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is
  defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f).

  As of December 31, 2022, our management, under the oversight of our board of directors, conducted an assessment of the
  effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria for effective internal control over financial
  reporting established by the Committee of Sponsoring Organization of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control - Integrated
  Framework (2013). Based on this assessment, our management concluded that the Company’s internal control over financial
  reporting was not effective as of December 31, 2022 due to the material weaknesses described below.

  A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in our internal control over financial reporting such that there
  is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim consolidated financial statements would not be
  prevented or detected on a timely basis.

  Based on this assessment, management concluded that the Company’s risk assessment process was not effective in
  implementing controls on a timely basis in response to changes to the business operations, personnel, and other factors affecting
  certain financial reporting processes and related information technology (“IT”) systems. As a result, the Company had ineffective
  Information Technology General Controls (“ITGCs”) related to certain systems, applications, and tools used for financial reporting;
  and the Company did not establish effective user access and segregation of duties controls across financially relevant functions.
  Therefore, the automated and manual process level controls over financial reporting which were dependent upon these ITGCs
  could not be relied upon.

  The control deficiencies identified did not result in misstatements to our consolidated financial statements; however, the control
  deficiencies described above created a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement to the consolidated financial
  statements would not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Therefore, our management concluded that the deficiencies
  represent material weaknesses.

  KPMG LLP, the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, who audited the consolidated financial statements
  included in this Form 10-K, has issued an attestation report on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. KPMG
  LLP’s attestation report contains an adverse opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial
  reporting. KPMG LLP’s report is included in Item 8 in this Form 10-K.

  Remediation Efforts to Address the Material Weaknesses

  The aforementioned material weaknesses were identified in 2021. While the Company has improved its organizational
  capabilities, the material weaknesses remain un-remediated as of December 31, 2022, and the Company’s remediation efforts
  will continue to take place in 2023.

  During the year ended December 31, 2022, management completed the following remedial actions:
      • performed a risk assessment over the IT systems used as part of financial reporting and business processes, including the
           various layers of technology;
      • implemented processes to identify sensitive access and segregation of duties risks across relevant business and IT
           functions, implemented tools and systems to support the ongoing maintenance and evaluation of the risks and controls,
           and implemented controls to address risks within certain privileged IT access;
      • designed, developed, and deployed an enhanced ITGC framework, including the implementation of a number of systems
           and tools to enable the effectiveness and consistent execution of these controls; and
      • hired critical leadership roles with public company and internal control experience responsible for designing,
           implementing, and monitoring our ITGCs, including the Chief Information Officer, Chief Operating Officer, Vice President
           Corporate Controller, and Head of SOX Compliance.

  In addition to the remedial actions taken to date, the Company is still considering the full extent of the procedures to implement
  in order to remediate the material weaknesses described above. However, the current remediation plan includes:
       • continuing to implement processes and controls to better manage and monitor our segregation of duties risks, including
           enhancing the usage of technology and tools for segregation of duties within the Company’s systems, applications, and
           tools;
       • continuing to implement ITGCs to manage access and program changes within our IT environment and to support the
           evaluation, monitoring, and ongoing effectiveness of key application controls and key reports; including:
                ◦    enhancing controls and the usage of technology and tools over consistent provisioning, deprovisioning, and
                    periodic reviews of user access;
                ◦    enhancing monitoring processes to drive improved execution of ITGCs, including assessing the impact of
                    business and technology changes for the continued alignment with financial reporting needs; and
       • continuing to expand our resources with the expertise, technical knowledge, and structure to implement, monitor, and
           maintain ITGCs, with a focus on user assess and segregation of duties controls.

  The actions that we are taking are subject to ongoing management review and audit committee oversight. We will not be able to
  conclude whether the steps we are taking will fully remediate the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial
  reporting until we have completed our remediation efforts and subsequently evaluated their effectiveness. We may also conclude
  that additional measures are required to remediate the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting.

  Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

  Except for the remediation measures in connection with the material weaknesses described above, there were no changes in our
  internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act, during the quarter
  ended December 31, 2022 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial
  reporting.

  ITEM 1.         BUSINESS

  Overview

  We are a leading manufacturer and distributor of premium automotive parts used in the maintenance, service and repair of vehicles
  in the automotive aftermarket industry. Through organic growth and several recent acquisitions, described further below, we have
  strengthened our capabilities as a supplier of custom-engineered products for on-highway (commercial and light vehicles) and off-
  highway (construction and agriculture, and all other) applications. We sell our products primarily to automotive aftermarket
  retailers, warehouse distributors, original equipment manufacturers and original equipment service part operations in the United
  States, Canada, Europe, Asia, Mexico and other Latin American countries.

  As of December 31, 2022, we managed our business pursuant to two operating segments, each focusing on a specific line of parts.
  Our Engine Management segment generates revenue from the sale of automotive engine parts, including ignition, emission control,
  fuel, electrical and safety related system products, and wire and cable parts. Our Temperature Control segment generates revenue
  from the sale of automotive temperature control systems parts, including air conditioning compressors and other climate control
  parts.

  Beginning in the first quarter of 2023, our business will be organized into three operating segments – Engineered Solutions, Vehicle
  Control and Temperature Control.


                                                                    3

  Index

          Engineered Solutions is a new operating segment created by carving out all non-aftermarket business from our existing Engine
          Management and Temperature Control operating segments, which will now solely reflect parts sales to aftermarket channels.
          This will provide clarity regarding the unique dynamics and margin profiles of the markets served by each segment. Our
          Engineered Solutions segment will supply custom-engineered solutions to vehicle and equipment manufacturers in non-
          aftermarket end markets, such as-

              •    Commercial and Light vehicles

              •    Construction

              •    Agriculture

              •    Power Sports

              •    Marine

              •    Hydraulics

              •    Lawn & Garden

          The Engineered Solutions segment sells into highly fragmented global end markets and is expected to provide a platform for
          future growth. Our growth strategy is long-term and we do not expect growth to be linear given the nature of customized
          engineering and the period of time between the awarding of new business and start of production. Some of our growth drivers
          in this segment include:

              •    Developing new customer relationships

              •    Cross-selling opportunities with existing customers

              •    Introducing new products to both new and existing customers

              •    Increasing content per unit

          Segment offerings include product categories from both of our legacy operating segments, and offer a broad array of
          conventional and future-oriented technologies, including those that are specific to vehicle electrification as well as those that
          are powertrain-neutral.

          Vehicle Control is the new name for our Engine Management operating segment; it will include our core aftermarket business
          after the carve out of all non-aftermarket business moved to the new Engineered Solutions operating segment. Within the
          Vehicle Control segment there will be three new major product groups:

          (1) Ignition, Emissions & Fuel, which will include the traditional internal combustion engine (ICE) dependent categories;

          (2) Wire Sets & Other, which will include spark plug wire sets and other related products, and are product categories we have
              noted to be in secular decline based upon product life cycle; and

          (3) Electrical & Safety, which will include powertrain neutral vehicle technologies such as electrical switches/relays, safety
              related products such as anti-lock brake and vehicle speed sensors, tire pressure monitoring, park assist sensors, and
              advanced driver assistance components.

          Our Temperature Control operating segment remains substantially unchanged, as only a small portion of its business will be
          moved to Engineered Solutions, and this legacy aftermarket business segment is poised to benefit from the broader adoption of
          more complex AC systems. Those systems will provide passenger comfort regardless of the vehicles powertrain propulsion,
          and are being developed to cool batteries and other products used on electric vehicles. Segment offerings will continue to
          provide thermal products in the aftermarket business under two major product groups:


                                                                         4

26/04/23, 10:13                        https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/93389/000114036123007960/brhc10048362_10k.htm
  Index

          (1) AC System Components, which includes compressors, connecting lines, heat exchangers, and expansion devices

          (2) Other Thermal Components, which includes parts that provide engine, transmission, electric drive motor, and battery
              temperature management

  This change will better align our operating segments with our strategic focus on diversification, and provide greater transparency
  into how we are positioned to capture growth opportunities of the future. The change will also better reflect the impact of our
  recent acquisitions.

  The following table summarizes both our reporting structure during 2022 and our planned 2023 reporting structure:

  Our Business Strategy

  The automotive aftermarket is a mature industry with participants that manufacture, distribute and sell vehicle replacement parts to
  professional technicians and to individual consumers, who perform “do-it-yourself” repairs on their personal vehicles. While
  generally a stable industry, the aftermarket tends to be influenced by trends such as the number of vehicles on the road, the average
  age of vehicles on the road, and the total number of miles driven per year. Weather extremes like unseasonably hot or cool
  temperatures in the summer can also have an impact on aftermarket product demand.

  Other economic factors such as the level of new vehicle sales and production rates, which more recently have been impacted by
  global supply chain disruptions, can have a more direct impact on the on-highway and off-highway end markets we supply, such as
  commercial and light vehicles, construction, agricultural, power sports and others. Typically, these economic factors have a more
  indirect impact on the aftermarket.

  While approximately 80% of our business is to the automotive aftermarket, we seek to enhance and diversify our business through
  the following:

          •   Leveraging our manufacturing and distribution capabilities to secure additional business globally

          •   Supporting the service part operations of vehicle and equipment manufacturers with value-added services and product
              support for the life of the part

          •   Developing new product lines that complement our existing product offering and that have the potential for high growth

          •   Expanding our product offering in the medium and heavy duty, commercial vehicle, construction and agricultural
              equipment, power sports, and other end markets

          •   Executing our acquisition strategy


                                                                      5

  In 2021, we completed three acquisitions that expanded our business into specialized non-aftermarket end markets that
  complement our core aftermarket business. In addition to providing access to product technologies suitable to the aftermarket, and
  manufacturing and engineering capabilities to support our operating strategy to bring more product manufacturing in-house, these
  acquisitions provide geographic expansion in Europe and Asia.

   With over 100 years in business, we believe that our success is attributable to our focus on being a key strategic partner to our
  customers, and in doing so provide:

          •   Professional grade products and solutions within our areas of expertise.

          •   Comprehensive product coverage for all vehicles on the road through our offering of professional grade engine
              management and temperature control products.

          •   Supplier and customer focused initiatives designed to improve order fill rate and maintain high levels of product
              availability

          •   Expanding our product coverage to include a broader product mix in categories such as

                  o    Electrification, including electric vehicles (EVs) and hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs),

                  o    Connectivity and safety related products, such as

                           ➢ anti-lock brake (ABS)

                           ➢ vehicle speed sensors

                           ➢ tire pressure monitoring

                           ➢ park assist sensors

                           ➢ advanced driver assistance components to meet the needs of our customers

  In 2022, we introduced approximately 2,400 new products to the aftermarket, of which approximately two-thirds were powertrain
  neutral. We support our products with superior value-added services provided by our marketing and sales teams that provides our
  customers with offerings such as data-driven category management, technical support as well as product selection, assortment and
  application support for all of our products. In addition, we have a team dedicated to providing technical training, in-person and
  virtually, on diagnosing and repairing vehicles equipped with complex systems.

  We are committed to expanding our design, engineering and manufacturing capabilities, and vertically integrating production
  processes to bring more manufacturing in-house. We engineer, tool and manufacture many of the products we offer for sale and
  the components used in their assembly. We have found this level of vertical integration, in combination with our manufacturing
  footprint in low cost regions, provides advantages in terms of the cost, quality and availability of our products.

  Examples of vertically integrated processes:
    ➢ plastic molding operations                                       ➢ automated electronics assembly
    ➢ stamping and machining operations                                ➢ design and fabrication of processing and test equipment
    ➢ wire extrusion                                                   ➢ teardown, diagnostics and rebuilding of remanufactured air
                                                                         conditioning compressors,
                                                                         diesel injectors and diesel pumps

  We also believe that our technical capabilities have afforded us opportunities to expand our product coverage in our core
  aftermarket business and in the non-aftermarket end markets we supply for on-highway and off-highway applications, and have
  better positioned us to satisfy customer demand for both traditional, internal combustion engine (or ICE) applications, and non-ICE
  (electric or hybrid electric) applications.

  Our manufacturing footprint is geographically diverse with a greater presence in North America and Europe compared to many of
  our peers. We leverage our footprint to improve our cost position by locating labor-intensive processes within our low-cost plants,
  and by investing in automation and undertaking continuous improvement initiatives in our domestic facilities.

  Our Products & Services

  The following describes our business more particularly under our existing operating segments as of December 31, 2022 – Engine
  Management and Temperature Control. Our periodic reports for the first quarter of 2023 and reporting periods thereafter will
  focus on our new reporting structure and operating segments as of the first quarter of 2023 – Engineered Solutions, Vehicle Control
  and Temperature Control.

  Engine Management Segment

  Our Engine Management Segment manufactures and distributes a full line of critical components for most years, makes and
  models of vehicles on the road, including new technologies. Key product categories within our engine management portfolio
  include: (i) ignition, such as electronic ignition control modules, camshaft and crankshaft position sensors, ignition wires and coils;
  (ii) electrical, such as switches and relays; (iii) emissions, such as exhaust gas recirculation valves, pressure and temperature
  sensors and variable valve timing (VVT) components; (iv) fuel, such as mass airflow sensors, fuel pressure sensors, electronic
  throttle bodies and fuel injectors, including diesel injectors and pumps (new and remanufactured); and (v) safety-related systems,
  such as various sensors including anti-lock brake (ABS), vehicle speed, tire pressure monitoring (TPMS) and park assist sensors.

  We continuously look to expand our product offering. Recently, we have done so by adding late-model coverage for existing
  product categories, and new product categories in response to new and evolving vehicle technologies, including diesel control
  modules, pumps and components, turbochargers, evaporation emission control system components, exhaust gas temperature
  sensors, active grill shutters, battery current sensors, and Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) components, including
  blind spot detection sensors, cruise control distance sensors, lane departure sensor cameras and park assist backup cameras. For
  example, our offering includes more than seventy product categories for one of the first mass-produced hybrid electric vehicles
  (HEVs). As more HEVs enter the aftermarket, we intend to expand our product offering to service this important segment.

  Ignition, Emission Control, Fuel & Safety Related System Products. Replacement parts for ignition, emission, fuel and safety
  related systems accounted for $824.7 million, or 60%, of our consolidated net sales in 2022, $786.5 million, or 61%, of our
  consolidated net sales in 2021, and $691.7 million, or 61%, of our consolidated net sales in 2020.

  As the use and complexity of vehicle systems continue to develop and proliferate, we expect to identify and benefit from new sales
  opportunities. All new vehicles are factory‑equipped with numerous electronic control modules designed to monitor and control
  the internal combustion process and the emissions, transmission, safety and comfort systems of the vehicle. Newer automotive
  systems include Advanced Driver Assistance Systems and Collision Avoidance Systems to alert the driver to potential problems, or
  to avoid collisions by implementing safeguards. Many of these systems use on-board computers to monitor inputs from sensing
  devices located throughout the vehicle. Our sales of sensors, switches, actuators, valves, solenoids and related parts have increased
  as automobile manufacturers continue to equip their cars with these more complex engine management systems.

  New sales opportunities have also arisen in the United States as a result of government regulations regarding safety and emissions.
  Legally, automobiles must now comply with emissions standards from the time they were manufactured and, in most states, until
  the last day they are in use. Emissions laws and fuel economy regulations have had a positive impact on sales of our ignition,
  emissions control and fuel delivery parts since vehicles failing these laws may require repairs utilizing parts sold by us. Similarly,
  as government-mandated safety devices, such as anti-lock braking systems and air bags mature, requiring servicing and repair, we
  anticipate increased sales opportunities for many of our products such as ABS sensors, TPMS sensors and traction control
  products.

  Wire & Cable Products. Wire and cable parts accounted for $150.6 million, or 11%, of our consolidated net sales in 2022, $151.4
  million, or 12%, of our consolidated net sales in 2021, and $144 million, or 13%, of our consolidated net sales in 2020. These
  products include spark plug wire sets, battery cables, pigtails, sockets and a wide range of electrical wire, terminals, connectors
  and tools for servicing an automobile’s electrical system.

  Temperature Control Segment

  Our Temperature Control Segment manufactures and distributes a full line of critical components for the temperature control (air
  conditioning and heating) systems, engine cooling systems, power window accessories and windshield washer systems of motor
  vehicles. Key product categories within our temperature control portfolio include: air conditioning compressors (new and
  remanufactured), air conditioning repair kits, clutch assemblies, blower and radiator fan motors (brushless and brushed), filter
  dryers, evaporators, accumulators, actuators, hose assemblies, thermal expansion devices, heater valves, heater cores, A/C service
  tools and chemicals, fan assemblies, fan clutches, oil coolers, window lift motors, window regulators and assemblies, and
  windshield washer pumps.

  We continuously look to improve our cost position through strategic transactions with manufacturers in low cost regions.

            In 2014, we formed Foshan GWOYNG SMP Vehicle Climate Control & Cooling Products Co. Ltd., a China-based joint
            venture that manufactures light vehicle and heavy duty air conditioning accumulators, filter driers, hose assemblies, and
            switches.

            In 2017, we formed Foshan FGD SMP Automotive Compressor Co., Ltd., a China-based joint venture that manufactures
            light vehicle and heavy duty belt driven air conditioning compressors.

            In 2019, we acquired a minority interest ownership position in Foshan Che Yijia New Energy Technology Co., Ltd., a
            China-based manufacturer of electric air conditioning compressors.

  We believe these transactions enhance our position as a basic low-cost manufacturer and leading supplier of temperature control
  products and create opportunity for growth in the China OE market. The joint ventures also provide complementary manufacturing
  capabilities and opportunities for synergy with our other manufacturing facilities, which we believe results in a more reliable
  supply of products, supporting our customers’ needs for consistent and reliable service levels.

  In 2022, we acquired Kade Trading GmbH, a supplier of temperature control products throughout Europe. We believe this
  acquisition provides synergies to our other recent acquisitions in 2021 into specialized end markets, and an entry point into the
  European market for our temperature control products with a strong focus on the continuing electrification of thermal systems.

  Compressors. Compressors accounted for $222.5 million, or 16%, of our consolidated net sales in 2022, $206.7 million, or 16%,
  of our consolidated net sales in 2021, and $163.1 million, or 14%, of our consolidated net sales in 2020. Included in consolidated
  net sales for the compressor product line is the revenue generated from the sale of kits.

  Other Climate Control Parts. Other climate control parts accounted for $159.8 million, or 12%, of our consolidated net sales in
  2022, $141.7 million, or 11%, of our consolidated net sales in 2021, and $118.9 million, or 11%, of our consolidated net sales in
  2020.

  Competition

  The automotive aftermarket industry is comprised of a large number of diverse manufacturers varying in product specialization
  and size. In addition to manufacturing, aftermarket companies must allocate resources towards a dynamic distribution process in
  order to maintain the flexibility and responsiveness on which their customers depend. Aftermarket manufacturers must be efficient
  producers of small lot sizes, and must distribute, with rapid turnaround times, products for nearly all domestic and import vehicles
  on the road today.

  We compete primarily on the basis of product quality, product availability, value-added services, product coverage, order
  turn‑around time, order fill rate, technical support and price. We believe we differentiate ourselves from our competitors primarily
  through:

              •     a value‑added, knowledgeable sales force;

              •     continuous product development, engineering & technical advancement;

              •     extensive market leading product coverage in conjunction with market leading brands;

              •     knowledgeable category management, including inventory stocking recommendations for our distributors to get
                    the right parts on the shelf for their marketplace;

              •     rigorous product qualification standards to ensure that our parts meet or exceed exacting performance
                    specifications;

              •     sophisticated parts cataloging systems, including catalogs available online through our website and our mobile
                    application;

              •     inventory levels and responsive logistical systems sufficient to meet the critical delivery requirements of
                    customers;

              •     breadth of manufacturing capabilities; and

              •     award-winning marketing programs, sales support and technical training.

  We offer a variety of strategic customer discounts, allowances and incentives to increase customer purchases of our products. For
  example, we offer cash discounts for paying invoices in accordance with the specified discounted terms of the invoice. We also
  offer rebates and discounts to customers as advertising and sales force allowances, and allowances for warranty and overstock
  returns are also provided. These discounts, allowances and incentives are a common practice throughout the automotive
  aftermarket industry, and we intend to continue to offer them in response to competitive pressures and to strategically support the
  growth of all our products.

  We are one of the leading independent manufacturers and distributors serving North America and other geographic areas in our
  core businesses of Engine Management and Temperature Control. In the Engine Management Segment, we compete with:
  ACDelco, Aptiv Plc, Denso Corporation, Continental AG, Hitachi, Ltd., Motorcraft, Robert Bosch GmbH, Visteon Corporation,
  NGK Spark Plug Co., Ltd., Dorman Products, Inc. and several privately-owned companies primarily importing products from
  Asia. In the Temperature Control Segment, we compete with: ACDelco, MAHLE GmbH, Denso Corporation, Motorcraft, Sanden
  International (U.S.A.), Inc., Continental AG, Dorman Products, Inc., and several privately-owned companies.

  Our business operates in highly competitive markets, and we face substantial competition in all markets that we serve. In addition,
  in the aftermarket, we face competition from automobile manufacturers who supply many of the replacement parts sold by us,
  although these manufacturers generally supply parts only for cars they sell through OE dealerships.

  Sales and Distribution

  In the traditional aftermarket channel, we sell our products to warehouse distributors and retailers. Our customers buy directly
  from us and sell directly to jobber stores, professional technicians and to “do-it-yourselfers” who perform automotive repairs on
  their personal vehicles. In recent years, warehouse distributors have consolidated with other distributors, and an increasing
  number of distributors own their jobber stores or sell down channel to professional technicians. Retailers are also consolidating
  with other retailers and have begun to increase their efforts to sell to professional technicians adding additional competition in the
  “do-it-for-me,” or the professional technician segment of our industry. As automotive parts and systems become more complex,
  “do-it-yourselfers” are less likely to service their own vehicles and may become more reliant on professional technicians.

  In the heavy duty aftermarket, we sell our products to recognized distributors who buy directly from us and sell directly to fleet
  operators and repair facilities for use in the repair and maintenance of medium to heavy duty vehicles. We also sell our products to
  the service parts divisions of heavy duty OEMs for distribution into the independent heavy duty aftermarket.

  In the original equipment market we sell our products to manufacturers of automotive, heavy duty truck, construction, agriculture,
  alternative energy, lawn/garden and powersports/marine vehicles and equipment, as well as their tier suppliers and system
  integrators. We also sell and support the service part divisions of each of our customers.

  We sell our products primarily in the United States, with additional sales in Canada, Europe, Asia, Mexico and other Latin
  American countries. Our sales are substantially denominated in U.S. dollars. For information on revenues and long-lived assets
  by geographic area, see Note 21 “Industry Segment and Geographic Data” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in
  Item 8 of this Report.

  Our customers have come to depend on our sales personnel as a reliable source for technical information and to assist with sales to
  their customers (e.g., jobber stores and professional technicians). In this manner, we direct a significant portion of our sales efforts
  to our customers’ customers to generate demand for our products, and we believe that the structure of our sales force facilitates
  these efforts by enabling us to implement our sales and marketing programs uniformly throughout the distribution channel.

  Another way we generate demand for our products is through our training program, which offers training seminars to professional
  automotive technicians. Our training program is accredited by the National Institute for Automotive Service Excellence (ASE)
  Training Managers Council. Our seminars are taught by ASE certified instructors in real time either in-person or by webinars
  online and feature more than 30 different topics. We also offer on-demand training webinars online on more than 150 different
  topics. Through our training program, we typically teach approximately 60,000 technicians annually how to diagnose and repair
  vehicles equipped with complex systems related to our products, and we have approximately 16,000 technicians who are registered
  to participate in such sessions through our online platform.


                                                                     11

  Seasonality

  Historically, our operating results have fluctuated by quarter, with the greatest sales occurring in the second and third quarters of
  the year and revenues generally being recognized at the time of shipment. It is in these quarters that demand for our products is
  typically the highest, specifically in the Temperature Control Segment of our business. In addition to this seasonality, the demand
  for our Temperature Control products during the second and third quarters of the year may vary significantly with the summer
  weather and customer inventories, as evidenced by the strong customer demand in 2022 fueled by the record heat across the
  country in 2022 and the replenishment of customer inventory levels after very warm summer conditions in 2021. While the
  COVID-19 pandemic caused large shifts in sales demand between quarters in 2020, our business returned to a more normalized
  pattern of seasonality and variability in demand of our Temperature Control products in 2022 and 2021. As such, our working
  capital typically peaks near the end of the second quarter, as the inventory build-up of air conditioning products was converted to
  sales, and payments on the receivables associated with such sales were yet to be received. During this period, our working capital
  requirements were funded by borrowing from our revolving credit facility in our Credit Agreement.

  Working Capital and Inventory Management

  We seek continuous improvements in our inventory management system, which are designed to reduce inventory requirements and
  enhance our ability to compete on the basis of product availability, product coverage, order turn‑around time and order fill rate.
  We have a pack‑to‑order distribution system, which permits us to retain slow moving items in a bulk storage state until a related
  order is received. This system reduces the volume of a given part in inventory. We also expanded our inventory management
  system to improve inventory deployment, enhance our collaboration with customers on forecasts and inventory assortments, and
  further integrate our supply chain with both our customers and suppliers.

  We face inventory management issues as a result of overstock returns. We permit our customers to return new, undamaged
  products within customer-specific limits (which are generally limited to a specified percentage of their annual purchases from us)
  in the event that they have overstocked their inventories. In addition, the seasonality of our Temperature Control Segment requires
  that we increase our inventory during the winter season in preparation of the summer selling season. We accrue for overstock
  returns as a percentage of sales after giving consideration to recent returns history.

  Our profitability and working capital requirements are seasonal due to our sales mix of Temperature Control products. Our
  working capital requirements typically peak near the end of the second quarter, as the inventory build‑up of air conditioning
  products is converted to sales and payments on the receivables associated with such sales have yet to be received. These increased
  working capital requirements are funded by borrowings from our revolving credit facility in our Credit Agreement. In 2022, we
  strategically increased inventory levels to help offset potential supply chain risks associated with extended lead times and delays
  transporting our product.

  Suppliers

  We source materials through a global network of suppliers to ensure a consistent, high quality and low cost supply of materials and
  key components for our product lines. As a result of the breadth of our product offering, we are not dependent on any single raw
  material.

  The principal raw materials purchased by us consist of brass, electronic components, fabricated copper (primarily in the form of
  magnet and insulated cable), steel magnets, laminations, tubes and shafts, stamped steel parts, copper wire, stainless steel coils and
  rods, aluminum coils, fittings, rods, cast aluminum parts, lead, steel roller bearings, rubber molding compound, thermo‑set and
  thermo plastic molding powders, and chemicals. Additionally, we use components and cores (used parts) in our remanufacturing
  processes for air conditioning compressors, diesel injectors, and diesel pumps.

  In the case of cores for air conditioning compressors, diesel injectors, and diesel pumps, we obtain them either from exchanges
  with customers who return cores subsequent to purchasing remanufactured parts or through direct purchases from a network of
  core brokers. In addition, we acquire certain materials by purchasing products that are resold into the market, particularly by OEM
  sources and other domestic and foreign suppliers.

  We believe there is an adequate supply of primary raw materials and cores; however, disruptions in the global economy have
  impeded global supply chains, resulting in longer lead times and delays in procuring component parts and raw materials, and
  inflationary cost increases in certain raw materials, labor and transportation. In response to the global supply chain volatility and
  inflationary cost increases, we have taken, and continue to take, several actions to mitigate the impact by working closely with our
  suppliers and customers to minimize any potential adverse impacts on our business, including initiating cost savings initiatives and
  the pass through of higher costs to our customers, which began in the fourth quarter of 2021. We believe that we have also
  benefited from our geographically diversified manufacturing footprint and our strategy to bring more product manufacturing in-
  house, especially with respect to product availability and fill rates.

  Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) and Human Capital

  We support and seek continuous improvement in the pursuit of environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) practices
  that embody our culture and what we believe it means to be a good corporate citizen.

  Our Culture

  Our Company was founded in 1919 on the values of integrity, common decency and respect for others. These values are embodied
  in our Code of Ethics, which has been adopted by the Board of Directors of the Company to serve as a statement of principles to
  guide our decision-making and reinforce our commitment to these values in all aspects of our business. These values also serve as
  the foundation for our continued focus on many important environmental, social and governance issues, such as environmental
  stewardship and our efforts to identify and implement practices that reduce our environmental impact while achieving our business
  goals; our attention to diversity, equity and inclusion, employee development, retention, and health and safety; and our community
  engagement initiatives, to name a few.

  Environmental Stewardship

  We have made significant strides with respect to our ESG initiatives, building awareness of the environmental impact of our
  operations, and challenging ourselves to reduce our impact by reducing our usage of energy and water, reducing our generation of
  waste, increasing our recycling efforts and reducing our Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions (“GHG”).

  As a leading manufacturer and distributor of premium parts used in the maintenance, service and repair of vehicles, we are proud
  of the role our parts play in replacing failed components that are necessary for vehicles to operate safely and efficiently, and in
  extending the service life of vehicles on the road. We believe our product offering also contributes to a greener car parc through
  several key product categories that are critical components in automotive systems designed to improve fuel economy and reduce
  harmful emissions, such as fuel injectors, exhaust gas recirculation valves, sensors and tubes, and evaporative emission control
  system components. We also bring to market alternative energy products, which utilize cleaner burning fuels or are designed for
  electric or hybrid electric vehicles.

  Our remanufacturing processes divert certain types of used automotive products from traditional waste streams and reprocess them
  for their original purpose. We remanufacture key product categories within our offering, such as air conditioning compressors,
  diesel injectors and diesel pumps, resulting in the production of premium automotive products within these categories through
  processes that we believe save energy and reduce waste.


                                                                   13

  Human Capital

  We believe that our commitment to our employees is critical to our continued success, and has led to high employee satisfaction
  and low employee turnover. To facilitate talent attraction and retention, we strive to have a diverse, inclusive and safe workplace,
  with opportunities for our employees to grow and develop in their careers, supported by strong compensation, benefits and health
  and wellness programs, and by programs that build connections between our employees and their communities. Our employees
  share our corporate values of integrity, common decency and respect of others, values which have been established since our
  company was founded.

  As of December 31, 2022, we employed approximately 4,900 people, with 2,000 people in the United States and 2,900 people in
  Mexico, Canada, Poland, the U.K., Germany, Hungary, China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Of the 4,900 people employed,
  approximately 2,500 people are production employees. We operate primarily in non‑union facilities and have binding labor
  agreements with employees at other unionized facilities. We have approximately 75 production employees in Edwardsville,
  Kansas who are covered by a contract with The International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement
  Workers of America (“UAW”) that expires in August 2026. We also have approximately 1,400 employees in Mexico who are
  covered under union agreements negotiated at various intervals. For clarification, the employee numbers described above exclude
  the employees of our joint venture operations.

  Although the COVID-19 pandemic has led to some challenges in finding adequate labor, generally we believe that our facilities are
  in labor markets with ready access to adequate numbers of skilled and unskilled workers, and we believe our relations with our
  union and non‑union employees are good.

  Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Belonging. We believe that a diverse workforce is critical to our success, and we continue to
  focus on the hiring, retention and advancement of women and underrepresented populations. Our recent efforts have been focused
  in three areas: inspiring innovation through an inclusive and diverse culture; expanding our efforts to recruit and hire world-class
  diverse talent; and identifying strategic partners to accelerate our inclusion and diversity programs. Over the last 5 years,
  approximately 50+% of our hires and promotions have been women or racially diverse individuals. To further our commitment to
  diversity, in 2021, we established a Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Belonging steering committee to develop key structures within
  our organization to promote equality, inclusion and awareness among our employees.

  Health, Safety and Wellness. The success of our business is fundamentally connected to the well-being of our people.
  Accordingly, we are committed to the health, safety and wellness of our employees. We provide our employees and their families
  with access to a variety of innovative, flexible and convenient health and wellness programs, including benefits that provide
  protection and security so they can have peace of mind concerning events that may require time away from work, or that impact
  their financial well-being; that support their physical and mental health by providing tools and resources to help them improve or
  maintain their health status and encourage engagement in healthy behaviors; and that offer choice where possible so they can
  customize their benefits to meet their needs and the needs of their families.

  Compensation and Benefits. We provide competitive compensation and benefits programs that meet the needs of our employees.
  In addition to wages and salaries, these programs include annual cash bonuses, stock awards, a 401(k) Plan, healthcare and
  insurance benefits, health savings and flexible spending accounts, paid time off, family leave, family care resources, and employee
  assistance programs.

  Talent Development. We invest significant resources to develop the talent of our high potential employees. We deliver numerous
  training opportunities, provide rotational assignment opportunities, offer continuous learning and development, and implement
  methodologies to manage performance, provide feedback and develop talent opportunities for talent.


                                                                   14

  Our talent development programs are designed to provide employees with the resources they need to help achieve their career
  goals, build management skills and lead their organizations. We provide a series of employee workshops and mentoring programs
  that support professional growth and development. Our annual review process encourages manager and employee conversations
  throughout the year to enhance growth and development.

  Social Engagement and Community Service

  We believe that building connections between our employees, their families and our communities creates a more meaningful,
  fulfilling and enjoyable workplace. Through our SMP Cares® initiative, we sponsor corporate giving and volunteering programs
  to encourage our employees to connect with our local communities and engage in the local causes that they are passionate about.

  Our volunteering efforts include organizing blood drives with the American Red Cross, and fundraising for the March of Dimes,
  United Way, and many others. In 2022, we collaborated with our employees to donate over $135,000 to local community
  organizations, schools, shelters, Ukraine, Project Hope, AACF, Habitat for Humanity, Love Independence, local parks, and Toys
  for Tots. We are a lifetime trustee of the University of the Aftermarket Foundation (“UAF”), and we donate $10,000 annually to
  fund scholarships to support the next generation of technicians and automotive professionals, which we believe is an important
  way to sustain and give back to our industry. We are also proud to sponsor annual scholarship contests for future automotive
  technicians, including our Women in Auto Care scholarship that aims to empower women entering the automotive industry. Since
  our first scholarship contest in 2015, we have awarded $275,000 in scholarships. We have continued to expand our scholarship
  program, and in 2022, we awarded four students each with a $5,000 scholarship to Women in AutoCare and to Blue Streak Better
  Then, Better Now Scholarship. We continue to encourage participation in these initiatives as we believe they are essential in the
  support of our core values.

  Governance

  Our commitment to ESG is spearheaded by our Board of Directors. Specifically, our Nominating and Corporate Governance
  Committee established an ESG steering committee among our executive officers including our Chief Executive Officer &
  President, Chief Legal Officer & Secretary, Chief Human Resources Officer, and Senior Vice President of North American
  Operations. This ESG steering committee is tasked with developing specific strategies to ensure that our operations adhere to our
  corporate governance values and advance our ESG objectives. The multidisciplinary approach of our steering committee allows it
  to leverage our expertise in operations, engineering, supply chain, human capital management, finance, legal and other fields to
  push our ESG initiatives ahead from all angles.

  Continued Commitment

  With each year, we intend to further our commitment to ESG initiatives, improving our environmental stewardship, finding ways
  to give back to our communities, and enhancing the diversity and inclusion of our workforce while offering opportunities for
  development. Information on our ESG initiatives can be found in our most current sustainability report and on our corporate
  website at ir.smpcorp.com under “Environmental & Social Responsibility” and at smpcares.smpcorp.com. Information in our
  sustainability report and on our corporate websites regarding our ESG initiatives are referenced for general information only and
  are not incorporated by reference in this Report.

  ITEM 1A.        RISK FACTORS

  You should carefully consider the risks described below. These risks and uncertainties are not the only ones we face. Additional
  risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or other factors not perceived by us to present significant risks to our business at
  this time also may impair our business and results of operations. If any of the stated risks actually occur, they could materially
  and adversely affect our business, financial condition or operating results.

  Risks Related to Our Operations

  We depend on a limited number of key customers, and the loss of any such customer, or a significant reduction in purchases
  by such customer, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

  Our three largest individual customers accounted for approximately 59% of our consolidated net sales in 2022. During 2022,
  O’Reilly, AutoZone and NAPA accounted for 27%, 17% and 15% of our consolidated net sales, respectively. The loss of one or
  more of these customers or, a significant reduction in purchases of our products from any one of them could have a materially
  adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, any consolidation among our key
  customers may further increase our customer concentration risk.

  We do not typically enter into long-term agreements with any of our customers. Instead, we enter into a number of purchase order
  commitments with our customers, based on their current or projected needs. We have in the past, and may in the future, lose
  customers or lose a particular product line of a customer due to the highly competitive conditions in the automotive aftermarket
  industry, including pricing pressures, consolidation of customers, customer initiatives to buy direct from foreign suppliers and/or to
  pursue a private brand strategy, or other business considerations. A decision by any significant customer, whether motivated by
  competitive conditions, financial difficulties or otherwise, to materially decrease the amount of products purchased from us, to
  change their manner of doing business with us, or to stop doing business with us, including a decision to source products directly
  from a low cost region such as Asia, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of
  operations. Because our sales are concentrated, and the market in which we operate is very competitive, we are under ongoing
  pressure from our customers to offer lower prices, extend payment terms, increase marketing allowances and other terms more
  favorable to these customers. These customer demands have put continued pressure on our operating margins and profitability,
  resulted in periodic contract renegotiation to provide more favorable prices and terms to these customers, and significantly
  increased our working capital needs.

  Our industry is highly competitive, and our success depends on our ability to compete with suppliers of automotive
  products, some of which may have substantially greater financial, marketing and other resources than we do.

  The automotive industry is highly competitive, and our success depends on our ability to compete with domestic and international
  suppliers of automotive products. In the Engine Management Segment, we compete with: ACDelco, Aptiv Plc, Denso Corporation,
  Continental AG, Hitachi, Ltd., Motorcraft, Robert Bosch GmbH, Visteon Corporation, NGK Spark Plug Co., Ltd., Dorman
  Products, Inc. and several privately-owned companies primarily importing products from Asia. In the Temperature Control
  Segment, we compete with: ACDelco, MAHLE GmbH, Denso Corporation, Motorcraft, Sanden International (U.S.A.), Inc.,
  Continental AG, Dorman Products, Inc., and several privately-owned companies. In addition, automobile manufacturers supply
  many of the replacement parts we sell. Some of our competitors may have larger customer bases and significantly greater
  financial, technical and marketing resources than we do. These factors may allow our competitors to:


                                                                    16

          •   respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements by devoting
              greater resources than we can to the development, promotion and sale of automotive products and services;

          •   engage in more extensive research and development;

          •   sell products at a lower price than we do;

          •   undertake more extensive marketing campaigns; and

          •   make more attractive offers to existing and potential customers and strategic partners.

  We cannot assure you that our competitors will not develop products or services that are equal or superior to our products or that
  achieve greater market acceptance than our products or that in the future other companies involved in the automotive industry will
  not expand their operations into product lines produced and sold by us. We also cannot assure you that additional entrants will not
  enter the automotive industry or that companies in the industry will not consolidate. Any such competitive pressures could cause
  us to lose market share or could result in significant price decreases and could have a material adverse effect upon our business,
  financial condition and results of operations.

  There is substantial price competition in our industry, and our success and profitability will depend on our ability to
  maintain a competitive cost and price structure.

  There is substantial price competition in our industry, and our success and profitability will depend on our ability to maintain a
  competitive cost and price structure. This is the result of a number of industry trends, including the impact of offshore suppliers in
  the marketplace (particularly in China) which do not have the same infrastructure costs as we do, the consolidated purchasing
  power of large customers, and actions taken by some of our competitors in an effort to ‘‘win over’’ new business. We have in the
  past reduced prices to remain competitive and may have to do so again in the future. Price reductions have impacted our sales and
  profit margins and may do so in the future. Our future profitability will depend in part upon our ability to respond to changes in
  product and distribution channel mix, to continue to improve our manufacturing efficiencies, to generate cost reductions, including
  reductions in the cost of components purchased from outside suppliers, to maintain a cost structure that will enable us to offer
  competitive prices, and to pass through higher distribution, raw materials and labor costs to our customers. Our inability to
  maintain a competitive cost structure could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of
  operations.

  Our business is seasonal and is subject to substantial quarterly fluctuations, which impact our quarterly performance and
  working capital requirements.

  Historically, our operating results have fluctuated by quarter, with the greatest sales occurring in the second and third quarters of
  the year and revenues generally being recognized at the time of shipment. It is in these quarters that demand for our products is
  typically the highest, specifically in the Temperature Control Segment of our business.

  In addition to this seasonality, the demand for our Temperature Control products during the second and third quarters of the year
  may vary significantly with the summer weather and customer inventories, as evidenced by the strong customer demand in 2022
  fueled by the record heat across the country in 2022 and the replenishment of customer inventory levels after very warm summer
  conditions in 2021. While the COVID-19 pandemic caused large shifts in sales demand between quarters in 2020, our business
  has returned to a more normalized pattern of seasonality and variability in demand of our Temperature Control products in 2022
  and 2021. As such, our working capital typically peaks near the end of the second quarter, as the inventory build‑up of air
  conditioning products was converted to sales, and payments on the receivables associated with such sales were yet to be received.
  During this period, our working capital requirements were funded by borrowing from our revolving credit facility in our Credit
  Agreement.


                                                                      17

  Climate-related physical risks, such as changes to weather patterns and conditions may also impact the pattern of seasonality and
  variability in demand for our Temperature Control products discussed above, which may impact our quarterly performance and
  working capital requirements.

  We may incur material losses and significant costs as a result of warranty-related returns by our customers in excess of
  anticipated amounts.

  Our products are required to meet rigorous standards imposed by our customers and our industry. Many of our products carry a
  warranty ranging from a 90-day limited warranty to a lifetime limited warranty, which generally covers defects in materials or
  workmanship, failure to meet industry published specifications and/or the result of installation error. In the event that there are
  material deficiencies or defects in the design and manufacture of our products and/or installation error, the affected products may
  be subject to warranty returns and/or product recalls. Although we maintain a comprehensive quality control program, we cannot
  give any assurance that our products will not suffer from defects or other deficiencies or that we will not experience material
  warranty returns or product recalls in the future.

  We accrue for warranty returns as a percentage of sales, after giving consideration to recent historical returns. While we believe
  that we make reasonable estimates for warranty returns in accordance with our revenue recognition policies, actual returns may
  differ from our estimates. We have in the past incurred, and may in the future incur, material losses and significant costs as a result
  of our customers returning products to us for warranty-related issues in excess of anticipated amounts. Deficiencies or defects in
  our products in the future may result in warranty returns and product recalls in excess of anticipated amounts and may have a
  material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

  Our profitability may be materially adversely affected as a result of overstock inventory related returns by our customers
  in excess of anticipated amounts.

  We permit overstock returns of inventory that may be either new or non-defective or non-obsolete but that we believe we can re-
  sell. Customers are generally limited to returning overstocked inventory according to a specified percentage of their annual
  purchases from us. In addition, a customer’s annual allowance cannot be carried forward to the upcoming year.

  We accrue for overstock returns as a percentage of sales, after giving consideration to recent historical returns. While we believe
  that we make reasonable estimates for overstock returns in accordance with our revenue recognition policies, actual returns may
  differ from our estimates. To the extent that overstocked returns are materially in excess of our projections, our business, financial
  condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.

  We may be materially adversely affected by asbestos claims arising from products sold by our former brake business, as
  well as by other product liability claims.

  In 1986, we acquired a brake business, which we subsequently sold in March 1998. When we originally acquired this brake
  business, we assumed future liabilities relating to any alleged exposure to asbestos-containing products manufactured by the seller
  of the acquired brake business. In accordance with the related purchase agreement, we agreed to assume the liabilities for all new
  claims filed after September 2001. Our ultimate exposure will depend upon the number of claims filed against us on or after
  September 2001, and the amounts paid for settlements, awards of asbestos-related damages, and defense of such claims. We do
  not have insurance coverage for the indemnity and defense costs associated with the claims we face.

  At December 31, 2022, 1,530 cases were outstanding for which we may be responsible for any related liabilities. Since inception
  in September 2001 through December 31, 2022, the amounts paid for settled claims and awards of asbestos-related damages,
  including interest, were approximately $64.6 million. A substantial increase in the number of new claims, or increased settlement
  payments, or awards of asbestos-related damages, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and
  results of operations.


                                                                    18

  In accordance with our policy to perform an annual actuarial evaluation in the third quarter of each year, an actuarial study was
  performed as of August 31, 2022. Based upon the results of the August 31, 2022 actuarial study, and all other available
  information to us, we increased our asbestos liability to the low end of the range, and recorded an incremental pre-tax provision of
  $18.5 million in earnings (loss) from discontinued operations in the accompanying statement of operations. The results of the
  August 31, 2022 study included an estimate of our undiscounted liability for settlement payments and awards of asbestos-related
  damages, excluding legal costs, ranging from $68.8 million to $111.6 million for the period through 2065. Future legal costs,
  which are expensed as incurred and reported in earnings (loss) from discontinued operations in the accompanying statement of
  operations, are estimated, according to the August 31, 2022 study, to range from $53.2 million to $105.7 million for the period
  through 2065.

  Given the uncertainties associated with projecting asbestos-related matters into the future and other factors outside our control, we
  cannot give any assurance that significant increases in the number of claims filed against us will not occur, that awards of asbestos-
  related damages or settlement awards will not exceed the amount we have in reserve, or that additional provisions will not be
  required. Management will continue to monitor the circumstances surrounding these potential liabilities in determining whether
  additional reserves and provisions may be necessary. We plan on performing an annual actuarial analysis during the third quarter of
  each year for the foreseeable future, and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that additional provisions may be
  necessary.

  In addition to asbestos-related claims, our product sales entail the risk of involvement in other product liability actions. We
  maintain product liability insurance coverage, but we cannot give any assurance that current or future policy limits will be
  sufficient to cover all possible liabilities. Further, we can give no assurance that adequate product liability insurance will continue
  to be available to us in the future or that such insurance may be maintained at a reasonable cost to us. In the event of a successful
  product liability claim against us, a lack or insufficiency of insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our
  business, financial condition and results of operations.

  We may not be able to achieve the benefits that we expect from our cost savings initiatives.

  We expect to realize the continued benefit of discretionary cost reduction measures, along with the continued cost savings
  anticipated from several ongoing and/or recently completed restructuring and integration initiatives. Due to factors outside our
  control, such as the adoption or modification of domestic and foreign laws, regulations or policies, we may not be able to achieve
  the level of benefits that we expect to realize in these initiatives, or we may not be able to realize these benefits within the time
  frames we currently expect. Our ability to achieve any anticipated cost savings could be affected by a number of factors such as
  changes in the amount, timing and character of charges related to such initiatives, or a substantial delay in the completion of such
  initiatives. Failure to achieve the benefits of our cost saving initiatives could have a material adverse effect on us. Our cost
  savings is also predicated upon maintaining our sales levels.

  Severe weather, natural disasters and other disruptions could adversely impact our operations at our manufacturing and
  distribution facilities.

  Severe weather conditions and natural disasters, such as hurricanes, tornados, earthquakes and floods, could damage our properties
  and effect our operations, particularly our major manufacturing and distribution operations at foreign facilities in Canada, China,
  Mexico, Poland, Germany and Hungary and at our domestic facilities in Florida, Indiana, Kansas, South Carolina, Texas, Virginia,
  and Wisconsin. Moreover, global climate change may cause these natural disasters to occur more frequently and/or with more
  intense effects, which could prevent us from, or cause delays in our ability to, manufacture and deliver products to our customers,
  and/or cause us to incur additional costs.


                                                                     19

  In addition, our business and operations could be materially adversely affected in the event of other serious disruptions at these
  facilities due to fire, electrical blackouts, power losses, telecommunications failures, terrorist attack or similar events. Any of these
  occurrences could impair our ability to adequately manufacture or supply our customers due to all or a significant portion of our
  equipment or inventory being damaged. If our existing manufacturing or distribution facilities become incapable of producing and
  supplying products for any reason, we may not be able to satisfy our customers’ requirements and we may lose revenue and incur
  significant costs and expenses that may not be recoverable through our business interruption insurance.

  Disruptions in the supply of raw materials, manufactured components, or equipment could materially and adversely affect
  our operations and cause us to incur significant cost increases.

  We source various types of raw materials, finished goods, equipment, and component parts from suppliers as part of a global
  supply chain, and we may be materially and adversely affected by the failure of those suppliers to perform as expected. Although
  we have had an adequate supply of purchased supplier raw materials, finished goods, equipment and component parts, disruptions
  in the global economy have impeded global supply chains, resulting in longer lead times and delays in procuring component parts
  and raw materials, and inflationary cost increases in certain raw materials, labor and transportation. In response to the global
  supply chain volatility and inflationary cost increases, we have taken, and continue to take, several actions to mitigate the impact
  by working closely with our suppliers and customers to minimize any potential adverse impacts on our business, including
  initiating cost savings initiatives and the pass through of higher costs to our customers, which began in the fourth quarter of 2021.
  We expect these inflationary trends to continue for some time, and while we believe that we will be able to somewhat offset the
  impact, there can be no assurances that unforeseen future events in the global supply chain affecting the availability of materials
  and components, and/or increasing commodity pricing, will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition
  and results of operations.

  Additionally, supplier non-performance may consist of delivery delays or failures caused by production issues or delivery of non-
  conforming products. Our suppliers’ ability to supply products to us is also subject to a number of risks, including the availability
  and cost of raw materials, the destruction of their facilities, work stoppages, cyber attacks on their information technology systems
  or other limitations on their business operations, which could be caused by any number of factors, such as labor disruptions,
  financial distress, severe weather conditions and natural disasters, social unrest, economic and political instability, and public
  health crises, including the occurrence of a contagious disease or illness, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, war, terrorism or other
  catastrophic events. In addition, our failure to promptly pay, or order sufficient quantities of inventory from our suppliers may
  increase the cost of products we purchase or may lead to suppliers refusing to sell products to us at all. Our efforts to protect
  against and to minimize these risks may not always be effective.

  Our operations could be adversely affected by interruptions or breaches in the security of our computer and information
  technology systems.

  We rely on information technology systems throughout our organization to conduct day-to-day business operations, including the
  management of our supply chain and our purchasing, receiving and distribution functions. We also routinely use our information
  technology systems to send, receive, store, access and use sensitive data relating to our Company and its employees, customers,
  suppliers, and business partners, including intellectual property, proprietary business information, and other sensitive materials.
  Additionally, we rely on our information technology systems to enable many of our employees to work remotely as a result of new
  policies and practices enacted by us.


                                                                     20

  Our information technology systems have been subject to cyber threats, including attempts to hack into our network and computer
  viruses. Such hacking attempts and computer viruses have not significantly impacted or interrupted our business operations.
  While we implement security measures designed to prevent and mitigate the risk of cyber attacks, our information technology
  systems, and the systems of our customers, suppliers and business partners, may continue to be vulnerable to computer viruses,
  attacks by hackers, or unauthorized access caused by employee error or malfeasance. The exploitation of any such vulnerability
  could unexpectedly compromise our information security, or the security of our customers, suppliers and other business partners.
  Furthermore, because the techniques used to carry out cyber attacks change frequently and in many instances are not recognized
  until after they are used against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these changes or implement adequate preventative
  measures. If our information technology systems, or the systems of our customers, suppliers or business partners, are subject to
  cyber attacks, such as those involving significant or extensive system interruptions, sabotage, computer viruses or unauthorized
  access, we could experience disruptions to our business operations and incur substantial remediation costs, which could have a
  material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

  The transition risks associated with global climate change may cause us to incur significant costs.

  In addition to the physical risks described above, global climate change has brought about certain risks associated with the
  anticipated transition to a lower-carbon economy, such as regulatory changes affecting vehicle emissions and fuel efficiency
  requirements, technological changes in vehicle architectures, changes in consumer demand, carbon taxes, greenhouse gas
  emissions tracking, and regulation of greenhouse gas emissions from certain sources. Any regulatory changes aimed to reduce or
  eliminate greenhouse gas emissions may require us to incur increased operating costs, such as to purchase and operate emissions
  control systems or other such technologies to comply with applicable regulations or reporting requirements. These regulations, as
  well as shifts in consumer demand due to public awareness and concern of climate change, could affect the timing and scope of
  their proliferation and may also adversely impact our sales of products designed for the internal combustion engines. As we
  monitor the rapid developments in this area, we may be required to adjust our business strategy to address the various transition
  risks posed by climate change.

  Failure to maintain the value of our brands could have an adverse effect on our reputation, cause us to incur significant
  costs and negatively impact our business.

  Our brands are an important component of our value proposition, and serve to distinguish our premium engine management and
  temperature control products from those of our competitors. We believe that our success depends, in part, on maintaining and
  enhancing the value of our brands and executing our brand strategies, which are designed to drive end-user demand for our
  products and make us a valued business partner to our customers through the support of their marketing initiatives. A decline in
  the reputation of our brands as a result of events, such as deficiencies or defects in the design or manufacture of our products, or
  from legal proceedings, product recalls or warranty claims resulting from such deficiencies or defects, may harm our reputation as
  a manufacturer and distributor of premium automotive parts, reduce demand for our products and adversely affect our business.

  Our revenue and results of operations may suffer upon the bankruptcy, insolvency or other credit failure of a significant
  customer.

  Most of our customers buy products from us on credit. We extend credit to customers and offer extended payment terms based
  upon competitive conditions in the marketplace and our assessment and analysis of creditworthiness. General economic conditions,
  competition and other factors may adversely affect the solvency or creditworthiness of our customers. Inflationary cost increases in
  raw materials, labor and transportation and a general worsening of economic conditions has put financial pressure on many of our
  customers and may threaten certain customers’ ability to maintain liquidity sufficient to repay their obligations to us as they
  become due. The bankruptcy, insolvency or other credit failure of any customer that has a substantial amount owed to us could
  have a material adverse effect on our operating revenue and results of operations. In January 2023, one of our customers filed a
  petition for bankruptcy. In connection with the bankruptcy filing, we recorded a $7 million charge in 2022 to reduce our
  outstanding accounts receivable balance from the customer to our estimated recovery amount.


                                                                   21

  Risks Related to Liquidity

  We are exposed to risks related to our receivables supply chain financing arrangements.

  We are party to several supply chain financing arrangements, in which we may sell certain of our customers’ trade accounts
  receivable without recourse to such customers’ financial institutions. To the extent that these arrangements are terminated, our
  financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity could be adversely affected by extended payment terms, delays
  or failures in collecting trade accounts receivables.

  The utility of the supply chain financing arrangements also depends upon a benchmark reference rate for the purpose of
  determining the discount rate on the sale of the underlying trade accounts receivable. If the benchmark reference rate increases
  significantly, we may be negatively impacted as we may not be able to pass these added costs on to our customers, which could
  have a material and adverse effect upon our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Depending upon the level of
  sales of receivables pursuant these agreements, a hypothetical, instantaneous and unfavorable change of 100 basis points in the
  reference rate may have an approximate $8.1 million negative impact on our earnings or cash flows.

  A significant increase in our indebtedness, or in interest rates, could negatively affect our financial condition, results of
  operations and cash flows.

  We have a Credit Agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, and a syndicate of lenders, which we refer
  to throughout this Report as our Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement provides for a $500 million credit facility comprised of a
  $100 million term loan facility (the “term loan”) and a $400 million multi-currency revolving credit facility available in U.S.
  Dollars, Euros, Sterling, Swiss Francs, Canadian Dollars and other currencies as agreed to by the administrative agent and the
  lenders (the “revolving facility”). As of December 31, 2022, our total outstanding indebtedness was $239.6 million, including
  outstanding borrowings under the Credit Agreement of $239.5 million, consisting of current borrowings of $55 million and long-
  term borrowings of $184.5 million.

  Borrowings under our Credit Agreement bear interest, at the Company’s election, at a rate per annum equal to Term SOFR plus
  0.10% plus an applicable margin, or an alternate base rate plus an applicable margin, where the alternate base rate is the greater of
  the prime rate, the federal funds effective rate plus 0.50%, and one-month Term SOFR plus 0.10% plus 1.00%. The applicable
  margin for the term benchmark borrowings ranges from 1.0% to 2.0%, and the applicable margin for alternate base rate borrowings
  ranges from 0% to 1.0%, in each case, based on the total net leverage ratio of the Company and its restricted subsidiaries.

  The significant increase in our indebtedness could:

          •   increase our borrowing costs;
          •   limit our ability to obtain additional financing or borrow additional funds;
          •   require that a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations be used to pay principal and interest in our
              indebtedness, instead of funding working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, dividends, stock repurchases, or other
              general corporate purposes;
          •   limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate; and
          •   increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions.

  In addition, the Company’s obligations under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by its material domestic subsidiaries (each, a
  “Guarantor”), and secured by a first priority perfected security interest in substantially all of the existing and future personal
  property of the Company and each Guarantor, subject to certain exceptions. The collateral security described above also secures
  certain banking services obligations and interest rate swaps and currency or other hedging obligations of the Company owing to
  any of the then existing lenders or any affiliates thereof. Concurrently with the Company’s entry into the Credit Agreement, the
  Company also entered into a seven year interest rate swap agreement with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., Co-Syndication Agent and
  lender under the Credit Agreement, on $100 million of borrowings under the Credit Agreement. The interest rate swap agreement
  matures in May 2029.


                                                                      22

  The Credit Agreement contains customary covenants limiting, among other things, the incurrence of additional indebtedness, the
  creation of liens, mergers, consolidations, liquidations and dissolutions, sales of assets, dividends and other payments in respect of
  equity interests, acquisitions, investments, loans and guarantees, subject, in each case, to customary exceptions, thresholds and
  baskets. The Credit Agreement also contains customary events of default. If we were default on any of these covenants, or on any
  of our
  indebtedness, if interest rates were to significantly increase, or the financial institution that is a party to our interest rate swap
  agreement were to default, or if we are unable to obtain necessary liquidity, our business could be adversely affected.

  We may not be able to generate the significant amount of cash needed to satisfy our obligations or maintain sufficient
  liquidity through borrowing capacities.

  Our ability either to make payments on or to refinance our indebtedness, or to fund planned capital expenditures and research and
  development efforts, will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future. Our ability to generate cash is in part subject to:

          •   general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control;

          •   the ability of our customers to pay timely the amounts we have billed; and

          •   our ability to sell receivables under supply chain financing arrangements.

  The foregoing factors could result in reduced cash flow, which could have a material adverse effect on us. When cash generated by
  earnings is not sufficient for the Company’s liquidity needs, the Company seeks external financing. Our access to funding sources
  in amounts adequate to finance our activities on terms that are beneficial to us could be impaired by factors that affect us
  specifically or the economy generally. During periods of disruptions in the credit and capital markets, potential sources of external
  financing could be reduced, and borrowing costs could increase. A significant downgrade in the company’s credit ratings could
  increase its borrowing costs and limit access to capital.

  Based on our current level of operations, we believe our cash flow from operations, available cash and available borrowings under
  our Credit Agreement will be adequate to meet our future liquidity needs for at least the next twelve months. Significant
  assumptions underlie this belief, including, among other things, that we will be able to mitigate the future impact, if any, of
  disruptions in the supply chain caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, Russia’s invasion of the Ukraine and the resultant sanctions
  imposed by the U.S. and other governments that may lead to a further increase in inventories to support our customers, and
  significant inflationary cost increases in raw materials, labor and transportation, and that there will be no material adverse
  developments in our business, liquidity or capital requirements. If we are unable to fund our operations through earnings or
  external financing, we will be forced to adopt an alternative strategy that may include actions such as:

          •   deferring, reducing or eliminating future cash dividends;

          •   reducing or delaying capital expenditures or restructuring activities;

          •   reducing or delaying research and development efforts;

          •   selling assets;

          •   deferring or refraining from pursuing certain strategic initiatives and acquisitions;

          •   refinancing our indebtedness; and

          •   seeking additional funding.


                                                                       23

  We cannot assure you that, if material adverse developments in our business, liquidity or capital requirements should occur, our
  business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations, or that future borrowings will be available to us under our Credit
  Agreement in amounts sufficient to enable us to pay the principal and interest on our indebtedness, or to fund our other liquidity
  needs. In addition, if we default on any of our indebtedness, or breach any financial covenant in our Credit Agreement, our
  business could be adversely affected.

  Risks Related to External Factors

  We conduct our manufacturing and distribution operations on a worldwide basis and are subject to risks associated with
  doing business outside the United States.

  We have manufacturing and distribution facilities in many countries, including Canada, Mexico, Poland, Germany and Hungary, as
  well as a joint-venture in China. Increasing our manufacturing footprint in low cost regions is an important element of our
  strategy. There are a number of risks associated with doing business internationally, including: (a) exposure to local economic and
  political conditions; (b) social unrest such as risks of terrorism or other hostilities; (c) currency exchange rate fluctuations and
  currency controls; (d) the effect of potential changes in U.S. trade policy and international trade agreements; and (e) the potential
  for shortages of trained labor.

  In particular, historically there has been social unrest in Hong Kong and Mexico and any recurrence, or increased violence in or
  around our facilities in such countries could be disruptive to our business operations at such facilities, or present risks to our
  employees who may be directly affected by the violence and may result in a decision by them to relocate from the area, or make it
  difficult for us to recruit or retain talented employees at such facilities.

  Furthermore, changes in U.S. trade policy, particularly as it relates to China, have resulted in the assessment of increased tariffs on
  goods that we import into the United States, and have caused uncertainty about the future of free trade generally. We benefit from
  free trade agreements, such as the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA). The repeal or modification of the USMCA or
  further increases to tariffs on goods imported into the United States could increase our costs to source materials, component parts
  and finished goods from other countries. The likelihood of such occurrences and their potential effect on us is unpredictable and
  may vary from country to country. Any such occurrences could be harmful to our business and our financial results.

  We may incur liabilities under government regulations and environmental laws, which may have a material adverse effect
  on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

  Domestic and foreign political developments and government laws and regulations directly affect automotive consumer products
  in the United States and abroad. In the United States, these laws and regulations include standards relating to vehicle safety, fuel
  economy and emissions, among others. Furthermore, increased public awareness and concern regarding climate change may result
  in new laws and regulations designed to reduce or mitigate the effects of greenhouse gas emissions or otherwise effect the
  transition to a lower-carbon economy. The modification of existing laws, regulations or policies, or the adoption of new laws,
  regulations or policies could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

  Our operations and properties are subject to a wide variety of increasingly complex and stringent federal, state, local and
  international laws and regulations, including those governing the use, storage, handling, generation, treatment, emission, release,
  discharge and disposal of materials, substances and wastes, the remediation of contaminated soil and groundwater and the health
  and safety of employees. Such environmental laws, including but not limited to those under the Comprehensive Environmental
  Response Compensation & Liability Act, may impose joint and several liability and may apply to conditions at properties presently
  or formerly owned or operated by an entity or its predecessors, as well as to conditions at properties at which wastes or other
  contamination attributable to an entity or its predecessors have been sent or otherwise come to be located.


                                                                    24

  The nature of our operations exposes us to the risk of claims with respect to such matters, and we can give no assurance that
  violations of such laws have not occurred or will not occur or that material costs or liabilities will not be incurred in connection
  with such claims. We are currently monitoring our environmental remediation efforts at one of our facilities and our reserve
  balance related to the environmental clean-up at this facility is $1.5 million at December 31, 2022. The environmental testing and
  any remediation costs at such facility may be covered by several insurance policies, although we can give no assurance that our
  insurance will cover any environmental remediation claims. We also maintain insurance to cover our existing U.S. and Canadian
  facilities. We can give no assurance that the future cost of compliance with existing environmental laws and the liability for known
  environmental claims pursuant to such environmental laws will not give rise to additional significant expenditures or liabilities that
  would be material to us. In addition, future events, such as new information, changes in existing environmental laws or their
  interpretation, and more vigorous enforcement policies of federal, state or local regulatory agencies, may have a material adverse
  effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

  Our future performance may be materially adversely affected by changes in technologies and improvements in the quality
  of new vehicle parts.

  If we do not respond appropriately to changes in automotive technologies, such as the adoption of new technologies and systems to
  make traditional, ICE vehicles more efficient, or the adoption of electric or hybrid electric vehicle architectures, we could
  experience less demand for our products thereby causing a decline in our results of operations or deterioration in our business and
  financial condition, and we may have a material adverse effect on our long-term performance.

  In addition, the size of the automobile replacement parts market depends, in part, upon the growth in number of vehicles on the
  road, increase in average vehicle age, change in total miles driven per year, new or modified environmental and vehicle safety
  regulations, including fuel economy and emissions reduction standards, increase in pricing of new cars and new car quality and
  related warranties. The automobile replacement parts market has been negatively impacted by the fact that the quality of more
  recent automotive vehicles and their component parts (and related warranties) has improved, thereby lengthening the repair cycle.
  Generally, if parts last longer, there will be less demand for our products and the average useful life of automobile parts has been
  steadily increasing in recent years due to innovations in products and technology. In addition, the introduction by original
  equipment manufacturers of increased warranty and maintenance initiatives has the potential to decrease the demand for our
  products. When proper maintenance and repair procedures are followed, newer air conditioning (A/C) systems in particular are
  less prone to leak resulting in fewer A/C system repairs. These factors could have a material adverse effect on our business,
  financial condition and results of operations.

  Our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected by the effects of
  widespread public health crises, including the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, that are beyond our control.

  The global outbreak of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic created significant volatility, uncertainty and economic
  disruption in many countries in which we operate, including the United States, Mexico, Canada, Poland, Germany, Hungary and
  China. We believe customer demand for our products and customer preferences regarding product mix and distribution channels
  were also impacted as a result of the pandemic, and significant uncertainty exists with respect to the general economic conditions
  as we emerge from the pandemic, including rising inflation, disruptions in the supply chain and a possible national or global

  distribution channels were to change, we may be required to adjust and reduce production volumes and implement cost reduction

  In certain countries in which we operate, national, state and local governments implemented a variety of measures in response to
  the COVID-19 pandemic. Many of these restrictions have been eased, however, there can be no guarantee that they will not be
  implemented in the future. Any restrictions or limitations on our ability to perform such operations could have a material adverse
  effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

  Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic and other public health crises could have a material adverse effect on the business,
  operations and financial condition of our customers, suppliers and other supply chain partners as a result of the governmental
  measures described above, disruptions to their business and operations for reasons similar to those described above, and their
  ability to manage and mitigate the adverse effects of these and other risks unique to their business and operations that may arise as
  a result of the pandemic.

  Consolidated net sales for 2022 were $1,371.8 million, an increase of $73 million, or 5.6% compared to net sales of $1,298.8
  million in 2021, and an increase of $170.2 million, or 15.1%, compared to net sales of $1,128.6 million in 2020. Consolidated net
  sales increased in both our Engine Management and Temperature Control Segments.

  The increase in net sales in 2022 reflects the favorable impact of multiple factors including:

          •   the price increases in both our segments, which were implemented to pass through inflationary increases in raw materials,
              distribution and labor costs,

          •   incremental net sales in our Engine Management Segment from our soot sensor, Trombetta and Stabil acquisitions, and

          •   continued strong customer demand in both our segments, and in particular in our Temperature Control Segment where the
              elevated customer demand we saw in 2021 held firm in 2022 fueled by record heat across the country and the
              replenishment of customer inventory levels after very warm summer conditions in 2021.

  Gross margins as a percentage of net sales in 2022 was 27.9% as compared to 29% in 2021 and 29.8% in 2020. Although the gross
  margin percentage decreased in 2022, gross margin dollars increased in 2022 to $382.5 million compared to $376.9 million in
  2021 and $336.7 in 2020. The gross margin decrease as a percentage of sales in 2022 reflects the impact of lower fixed cost
  absorption due to lower and more normalized production, inflationary cost increases in raw materials, labor and transportation,
  which were somewhat offset by increased pricing, the higher mix of non-aftermarket parts sales from recent acquisitions, which
  have a different profile than our aftermarket business with lower gross margins but comparable operating margin, and higher
  freight and related expenses resulting from higher inventory levels. While we anticipate continued margin pressure resulting from
  inflationary cost increases, we believe that our annual cost initiatives and our ability to pass through higher prices to our
  customers, will help to mitigate the impact of the inflationary increases on our margins.

  Operating margin as a percentage of net sales in 2022 was 7.6% as compared to 9.9% in 2021 and 9.6% in 2020. Included in our
  operating margin were selling, general and administrative expenses (“SG&A”) of $276.6 million, or 20.2% of net sales in 2022,
  $247.5 million, or 19.1% of net sales in 2021, and $224.7 million, or 19.9% of net sales in 2020. The higher SG&A expenses in
  2022 is principally due to the impact of (1) higher interest rate related costs of $20.6 million incurred in our supply chain financing
  arrangements, (2) the impact of the $7 million charge recorded in 2022 to reduce our outstanding accounts receivable balance from
  one of our customers that filed a petition for bankruptcy in January 2023 to our estimated recovery amount, (3) incremental
  expenses of $7.2 million from our soot sensor, Trombetta and Stabil acquisitions, including amortization of intangible assets
  acquired, and (4) inflationary cost increases resulting in higher distribution and freight costs. SG&A expenses in 2022 were
  favorably impacted by the higher mix of non-aftermarket parts sales from recent acquisitions, which have a different profile than
  our aftermarket business with lower SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales.

  Overall, our core automotive aftermarket business demand remains strong, and we continue to make major strides into new
  complementary markets with upside potential.

  New $500 Million Credit Facility

  In June 2022, we entered into a new Credit Agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, and a syndicate
  of lenders (the “Credit Agreement”). The Credit Agreement provides for a $500 million credit facility comprised of a $100 million
  term loan facility (the “term loan”) and a $400 million multi-currency revolving credit facility (the “revolving facility”).
  Concurrently with our entry into the Credit Agreement, we also entered into a seven year interest rate swap agreement with Wells
  Fargo Bank, N.A., Co-Syndication Agent and lender under the Credit Agreement on $100 million of borrowings under the Credit
  Agreement to manage exposure to interest rate changes. The interest rate swap agreement matures in May 2029.

  Borrowings under the Credit Agreement were used to repay all outstanding borrowings under the existing 2015 Credit Agreement,
  and pay certain fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Credit Agreement, with future borrowings used for other general
  corporate purposes of the Company and its subsidiaries. The term loan amortizes in quarterly installments of 1.25% in each of the
  first four years, and quarterly installments of 2.5% in the fifth year of the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement matures on
  June 1, 2027. The Company may request up to two one-year extensions of the maturity date.

  Impact of Russia’s Invasion of the Ukraine

  Russia’s invasion of the Ukraine, and the resultant sanctions imposed by the U.S. and other governments, have created risks,
  uncertainties and disruptions impacting business continuity, liquidity and asset values not only in the Ukraine and Russia, but in
  markets worldwide. Significant price increases have occurred in gas and energy markets, as well as in other commodities.
  Although we have no facilities or business operations in either the Ukraine or Russia, have historically had only minor sales to
  customers in Russia, which we have subsequently discontinued, and have not experienced additional significant disruptions in the
  supply chain, the inherent risks and uncertainties surrounding the invasion are being closely monitored. We have manufacturing
  and distribution facilities in Bialystok, Poland and Pecel, Hungary. Our facility in Bialystok, Poland does not use natural gas in its
  production process, or for heating, and, as such, is not impacted by Russia’s decision to halt the export of all natural gas to Poland
  and Bulgaria. While we have not been impacted by the war to date, there can be no assurances that any escalation of the invasion
  will not have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

  Impact of Global Supply Chain Disruption and Inflation

  Disruptions in the global economy have impeded global supply chains, resulted in longer lead times and delays in procuring
  component parts and raw materials, and resulted in inflationary cost increases in certain raw materials, labor and transportation. In
  response to the global supply chain volatility and inflationary cost increases, we have taken, and continue to take, several actions to
  mitigate the impact by working closely with our suppliers and customers to minimize any potential adverse impacts on our
  business, including implementing cost savings initiatives and the pass through of higher costs to our customers in the form of price
  increases, and increasing inventory levels to minimize the obvious disruptions from out-of-stock raw materials and components to
  ensure higher fill rates with our customers. We believe that we have also benefited from our geographically diversified
  manufacturing footprint and our strategy to bring more product manufacturing in-house, especially with respect to product
  availability and fill rates. We expect these inflationary trends to continue for some time, and while we believe that we will be able
  to somewhat offset the impact, there can be no assurances that unforeseen future events in the global supply chain affecting the
  availability of materials and components, and/or increasing commodity pricing, will not have an adverse effect on our business,
  financial condition and results of operations.

  Environmental, Social, & Governance (“ESG”)

  Our Company was founded in 1919 on the values of integrity, common decency and respect for others. These values continue to
  this day and are embodied in our Code of Ethics, which has been adopted by the Board of Directors of the Company to serve as a
  statement of principles to guide our decision-making and reinforce our commitment to these values in all aspects of our business.
  These values also serve as the foundation for our increased focus on many important environmental, social and governance issues,
  such as environmental stewardship and our efforts to identify and implement practices that reduce our environmental impact while
  achieving our business goals; our attention to diversity, equity and inclusion, employee development, retention, and health and
  safety; and our community engagement initiatives, to name a few.

  We have made significant strides with respect to our ESG initiatives, building awareness of the environmental impact of our
  operations, and challenging ourselves to reduce our impact by reducing our usage of energy and water, reducing our generation of
  waste, increasing our recycling efforts and reducing our greenhouse gas emissions (“GHG”), with the ambition of achieving net-
  zero GHG emissions by 2050. With each year, we intend to further our commitment to improving our environmental stewardship
  and finding ways to give back to our communities. Additional information on our ESG initiatives can be found under the heading,
  “Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) and Human Capital,” in Part I, Item 1 of this Report, and on our corporate website
  at ir.smpcorp.com under “Environmental & Social Responsibility” and at smpcares.smpcorp.com. Information on our corporate
  websites regarding our ESG initiatives are referenced for general information only and are not incorporated by reference in this

  Engine Management’s net sales increased $37.3 million, or 4%, to $975.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. Net
  sales in ignition, emission control, fuel and safety related system products for the year ended December 31, 2022 were $824.7
  million, an increase of $38.2 million, or 4.9%, compared to $786.5 million in the same period of 2021. Net sales in the wire and
  cable product group for the year ended December 31, 2022 were $150.6 million, an decrease of $0.8 million, or 0.5%, compared to
  $151.4 million in the same period of 2021. Engine Management’s increase in net sales for the year ended December 31, 2022
  compared to the same period in 2021, reflects the impact of the positive contribution of incremental sales from our soot sensor,
  Trombetta and Stabil acquisitions, strong customer demand, and price increases implemented in 2022, which were implemented to
  pass through inflationary increases in raw materials, distribution and labor costs.

  Incremental net sales from our soot sensor, Trombetta and Stabil acquisitions of $44.6 million were included in the net sales of the
  ignition, emission control, fuel and safety related system product group for the year ended December 31, 2022. Compared to the
  year ended December 31, 2021, excluding the incremental net sales from the acquisitions, net sales in the ignition, emission
  control, fuel and safety related product group decreased $6.4 million, or 0.8%, and Engine Management net sales decreased $7.3
  million, or 0.8%.

  Temperature Control’s net sales increased $33.9 million, or 9.7%, to $382.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. Net
  sales in the compressors product group for the year ended December 31, 2022 were $222.5 million, an increase of $15.8 million, or
  7.6%, compared to $206.7 million in the same period of 2021. Net sales in the other climate control parts group for the year ended
  December 31, 2022 were $159.8 million, an increase of $18.1 million, or 12.7%, compared to $141.7 million for the year ended
  December 31, 2021. Temperature Control’s increase in net sales for the year ended December 31, 2022, when compared to the
  same period in 2021, reflects the impact of continued strong customer demand, with the elevated demand we saw in 2021 holding
  firm, fueled by record heat across the country in 2022 and the replenishment of customer inventory levels after very warm summer
  conditions in 2021, and the impact of price increases, which were implemented to pass through inflationary increases in raw
  materials, distribution and labor costs. Demand for our Temperature Control products may vary significantly with summer
  weather conditions and customer inventory levels.

  Gross Margins. Gross margins, as a percentage of consolidated net sales, decreased to 27.9% for 2022, compared to 29% for
  2021. The following table summarizes gross margins by segment for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively

  Compared to 2021, gross margins at Engine Management decreased 1.5 percentage points from 28.5% to 27%, while gross
  margins at Temperature Control decreased 0.5 percentage points from 27.3% to 26.8%. The gross margin percentage decrease in
  Engine Management compared to the prior year reflects the impact of lower fixed cost absorption due to lower and more
  normalized production, inflationary cost increases in raw materials, labor and transportation, which were somewhat offset by
  increased pricing, the higher mix of non-aftermarket parts sales from recent acquisitions, which have a different profile than our

  from higher inventory levels.

  increases in raw materials, labor and transportation, and higher freight and related expenses resulting from higher inventory levels,
  which were somewhat offset by seasonal volume, customer mix and increased pricing. While we anticipate continued margin
  pressures at both Engine Management and Temperature Control resulting from inflationary cost increases, we believe that our
  annual cost initiatives, and our ability to pass through higher prices to our customers, will help to offset the impact of the
  inflationary increases on our margins.

  Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses (“SG&A”) increased to $276.6
  million, or 20.2% of consolidated net sales in 2022, as compared to $247.5 million, or 19.1% of consolidated net sales in 2021.
  The $29.1 million increase in SG&A expenses as compared to 2021 is principally due to the impact of (1) higher interest related
  costs of $20.6 million incurred in our supply chain financing arrangements, (2) the impact of the $7 million charge recorded in
  2022 to reduce our outstanding accounts receivable balance from one of our customers that filed a petition for bankruptcy in
  January 2023 to our estimated recovery amount, (3) incremental expenses of $7.2 million from our soot sensor, Trombetta and
  Stabil acquisitions, including amortization of intangible assets acquired, and (4) inflationary cost increases resulting in higher
  distribution and freight costs. SG&A expenses in 2022 were favorably impacted by the higher mix of non-aftermarket parts sales
  from recent acquisitions, which have a different profile than our aftermarket business with lower SG&A expenses as a percentage
  of sales.

  Restructuring and Integration Expenses. Restructuring and integration expenses were $1.9 million in 2022 compared to
  restructuring and integration expenses of $0.4 million in 2021. Restructuring and integration expenses incurred in 2022 of $1.9
  million related to (1) severance costs of approximately $0.9 million in connection with a reduction in our sales force, (2) expenses
  of approximately $0.6 million consisting of employee severance costs related to our product line relocations from our
  Independence, Kansas manufacturing facility in our Engine Management Segment and from our St. Thomas, Canada
  manufacturing facility in our Temperature Control Segment to our manufacturing facilities in Reynosa, Mexico, (3) relocation
  expenses of approximately $0.1 million in our Engine Management Segment of certain inventory, machinery, and equipment
  acquired in our 2021 soot sensor acquisition to our facilities in Independence, Kansas and Bialystok, Poland, and (4) the $0.2
  million increase in environmental cleanup costs for ongoing monitoring and remediation in connection with the prior closure of
  our manufacturing operations at our Long Island City, New York location.


                                                                    33

  Restructuring and integration expenses incurred in 2021 of $0.4 million related to relocation in our Engine Management Segment
  of certain inventory, machinery, and equipment acquired in our 2021 soot sensor acquisition to our facilities in Independence,
  Kansas and Bialystok, Poland. The soot sensor product line relocation has been substantially completed.

  Operating Income. Operating income was $104.1 million, or 7.6%, of consolidated net sales in 2022, compared to $129 million,
  or 9.9%, of consolidated net sales in 2021. The year-over-year decrease in operating income of $24.9 million is the result of higher
  SG&A expenses driven primarily by the increased interest rate costs incurred in our supply chain financing arrangements, and to a
  lesser extent by the impact of lower gross margins as a percentage of consolidated net sales and higher restructuring and
  integration costs offset, in part, by higher consolidated net sales.

  Other Non-Operating Income (Expense), Net. Other non-operating income, net was $4.8 million in 2022, compared to $3.5
  million in 2021. The year-over-year increase in other non-operating income, net results primarily from the favorable impact of
  changes in foreign currency exchange rates, and to a lesser extent the increase in year-over-year equity income from our joint
  ventures.

  Interest Expense. Interest expense increased to $10.6 million in 2022, compared to $2 million in 2021. The year-over-year
  increase in interest expense reflects the impact of higher average outstanding borrowings in 2022 when compared to 2021, and the
  impact of higher year-over-year average interest rates on our credit facilities.

  Income Tax Provision. The income tax provision for 2022 was $25.2 million at an effective tax rate of 25.6%, compared to $31
  million at an effective tax rate of 23.8% in 2021. The higher effective tax rate in 2022 compared to 2021 results primarily from the
  income tax provision impact related to the exercise of restricted stock.

  Loss From Discontinued Operations. Loss from discontinued operations, net of income tax, reflects information contained in the
  actuarial studies performed as of August 31, 2022 and 2021, as well as other information available and considered by us, and legal
  expenses and other costs associated with our asbestos-related liability. During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we
  recorded a net loss of $17.7 million and $8.5 million from discontinued operations, respectively. The loss from discontinued
  operations for the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 includes an $18.5 million and $5.3 million pre-tax provision,
  respectively, to increase our indemnity liability in line with the 2022 and 2021 actuarial studies; and legal expenses and other
  miscellaneous expenses, before taxes, of $5.4 million and $6.1 million for 2022 and 2021, respectively. As discussed more fully in
  Note 23 “Commitments and Contingencies” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report, we are
  responsible for certain future liabilities relating to alleged exposure to asbestos containing products.

  Net Earnings Attributable to Noncontrolling Interest. In May 2021, we acquired the Trombetta business for $111.7 million. As
  part of the acquisition, we acquired a 70% ownership in a joint venture in Hong Kong, with operations in Shanghai and Wuxi,
  China (“Trombetta Asia, Ltd.”). Net earnings attributable to the noncontrolling interest of $84,000 and $68,000 during the years
  ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, represents 30% of the net earnings of Trombetta Asia, Ltd.

  Liquidity and Capital Resources

  Operating Activities. During 2022, cash used in operating activities was $27.5 million compared to cash provided by operating
  activities of $85.6 million in 2021. The increase in cash used in operating activities resulted primarily from the decrease in net
  earnings, the smaller year-over-year decrease in accounts receivable, the decrease in accounts payable compared to a year-over-
  year increase in accounts payable, the larger year-over-year increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets, and the decrease
  in sundry payables and accrued expenses compared to a year-over-year increase in sundry payables and accrued expenses offset, in
  part, by the smaller year-over-year increase in inventories.

  Net earnings during 2022 were $55.4 million compared to $91 million in 2021. During 2022 (1) the decrease in accounts
  receivable was $6.9 million compared to the year-over-year decrease in accounts receivable of $28.5 million in 2021; (2) the
  increase in inventories was $67.5 million compared to the year-over-year increase in inventories of $107.6 million in 2021; (3) the
  decrease in accounts payable was $48.6 million compared to the year-over-year increase in accounts payable of $33 million in
  2021; (4) the increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets was $5.5 million compared to the year-over-year increase in
  prepaid expenses and other current assets of $0.8 million in 2021; and (5) the decrease in sundry payables and accrued expenses
  was $29.1 million compared to the year-over-year increase in sundry payables and accrued expenses of $13.4 million in 2021. The
  increase in inventories during 2022 and 2021 reflects actions taken beginning in the fourth quarter of 2021 to meet ongoing
  customer demand, the impact of materials inflation, and higher safety stocks of raw materials given the volatility in the supply
  chain. The decrease in accounts payable in 2022 reflects the timing of payments to vendors for inventory purchases made in the
  fourth quarter of 2021, as well as the timing of inventory purchases made in 2022, including the impact of a reduction in inventory
  purchases in the second half of the year; while the decrease in sundry payments in 2022 reflects the impact of lower employee
  compensation accruals. We continue to actively manage our working capital to maximize our operating cash flow.

  Investing Activities. Cash used in investing activities was $27.8 million in 2022 compared to $151.2 million in 2021. Investing
  activities during 2022 consisted of (1) the cash payment of $1.7 million for our acquisition of 100% of the capital stock of Kade
  Trading GmbH, a German company, (“Kade”) , net of $1 million of cash acquired and the $0.5 million earn-out; (2) the payment
  of $0.2 million for our 3.55% increase in equity ownership in Foshan Che Yijia New Energy Technology Co., Ltd., (“CYJ”), a
  China-based joint venture that manufactures automotive electric air conditioning compressors; and (3) capital expenditures of $26
  million.

  Investing activities in 2021 consisted of (1) the payment of $15.4 million, net of $0.9 million of cash acquired, for our acquisition
  of 100% of the capital stock of Stabil Operative Group GmbH, a German company, (“Stabil”); (2) the payment of $107.1 million,
  net of $4.6 million of cash acquired, for our acquisition of 100% of the capital stock of Trumpet Holdings, Inc., a Delaware
  corporation, (“Trombetta”); (3) the payment of $2.9 million for our acquisition of certain assets of the soot sensor product lines
  from Stoneridge, Inc.; and (4) capital expenditures of $25.9 million.

  Financing Activities. Cash provided by financing activities was $55.5 million in 2022 compared to $69 million in 2021. In June
  2022, we entered into a new credit agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as agent. The new credit agreement provides for a
  $500 million credit facility comprised of a $100 million term loan facility and a $400 million revolving credit facility. Borrowings
  under the new credit facility were used to repay all outstanding borrowings under the then existing revolving credit facility, and
  certain fees and expenses incurred in connection with the refinancing.

  During 2022, we (1) increased our borrowings under our revolving credit facilities by $114.2 million; (2) reduced our borrowings
  under lease obligations and our Polish overdraft facility by $2.9 million; (3) made cash payments of $2.1 million for debt issuance
  costs in connection with our refinancing; (4) made cash payments for the repurchase of shares of our common stock of $29.7
  million; and (5) paid dividends of $23.4 million. Cash provided by borrowings under our credit facilities were used to fund our
  operating activities, investing activities, reduce our borrowings under lease obligations and our Polish overdraft facility, pay debt
  issuance costs in connection with the refinancing, purchase shares of our common stock and pay dividends.


                                                                    35

  Cash provided by financing activities was $69 million in 2021. During 2021, we (1) increased our borrowings under our revolving
  credit facility by $115.3 million; (2) increased our borrowings under lease obligations and our Polish overdraft facility by $3
  million; (3) made cash payments for the repurchase of shares of our common stock of $26.8 million; and (4) paid dividends of
  $22.2 million. Cash provided by operating activities, along with borrowings under our revolving credit agreement, lease
  obligations and Polish overdraft facility were used to fund our investing activities, purchase shares of our common stock and pay
  dividends.

  Dividends of $23.4 million and $22.2 million were paid in 2022 and 2021, respectively. Quarterly dividends were paid at a rate of
  $0.27 in 2022 and $0.25 in 2021. In February 2023, our Board of Directors voted to increase our quarterly dividend from $0.27 per
  share in 2022 to $0.29 per share in 2023.

  Comparison of Liquidity and Capital Resources For Fiscal Years 2021 and 2020

  For a detailed discussion of our Liquidity and Capital Resources comparison of fiscal year 2021 to fiscal year 2020, see Item 7
  “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in the Company’s Annual Report on
  Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021.

  Liquidity

  Our primary cash requirements include working capital, capital expenditures, regular quarterly dividends, stock repurchases,
  principal and interest payments on indebtedness and acquisitions. Our primary sources of funds are ongoing net cash flows from
  operating activities and availability under our Credit Agreement (as detailed below).

  In June 2022, we entered into a new Credit Agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, and a syndicate
  of lenders (the “Credit Agreement”). The Credit Agreement provides for a $500 million credit facility comprised of a $100 million
  term loan facility (the “term loan”) and a $400 million multi-currency revolving credit facility available in U.S. Dollars, Euros,
  Sterling, Swiss Francs, Canadian Dollars and other currencies as agreed to by the administrative agent and the lenders (the
  “revolving facility”). The Credit Agreement replaces and refinances the existing Credit Agreement, dated as of October 28, 2015,
  among the Company, SMP Motor Products Ltd. and Trumpet Holdings, Inc., as borrowers, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as
  administrative agent and lender, and the other lenders named therein (the “2015 Credit Agreement”).

  Borrowings under the Credit Agreement were used to repay all outstanding borrowings under the 2015 Credit Agreement, and pay
  certain fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Credit Agreement, with future borrowings used for other general
  corporate purposes of the Company and its subsidiaries. The term loan amortizes in quarterly installments of 1.25% in each of the
  first four years, and quarterly installments of 2.5% in the fifth year of the Credit Agreement. The revolving facility has a $25
  million sub-limit for the issuance of letters of credit and a $25 million sub-limit for the borrowing of swingline loans. The
  maturity date is June 1, 2027. The Company may request up to two one-year extensions of the maturity date.

  The Company may, upon the agreement of one or more of then existing lenders or of additional financial institutions not currently
  party to the Credit Agreement, increase the revolving facility commitments or obtain incremental term loans by an aggregate
  amount not to exceed (x) the greater of (i) $168 million or (ii) 100% of consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Agreement)
  for the four fiscal quarters ended most recently before such date, plus (y) the amount of any voluntary prepayment of term loans,
  plus (z) an unlimited amount so long as, immediately after giving effect thereto, the pro forma First Lien Net Leverage Ratio (as
  defined in the Credit Agreement) does not exceed 2.5 to 1.0.

  Term loan and revolver facility borrowings in U.S. Dollars bear interest, at the Company’s election, at a rate per annum equal to
  Term SOFR plus 0.10% plus an applicable margin, or an alternate base rate plus an applicable margin, where the alternate base rate
  is the greater of the prime rate, the federal funds effective rate plus 0.50%, and one-month Term SOFR plus 0.10% plus 1.00%.
  Term loan borrowings are being made at one-month Term SOFR. The applicable margin for the term benchmark borrowings
  ranges from 1.0% to 2.0%, and the applicable margin for alternate base rate borrowings ranges from 0% to 1.0%, in each case,
  based on the total net leverage ratio of the Company and its restricted subsidiaries. The Company may select interest periods of
  one, three or six months for Term SOFR borrowings. Interest is payable at the end of the selected interest period, but no less
  frequently than quarterly.


                                                                   36

  The Company’s obligations under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by its material domestic subsidiaries (each, a “Guarantor”),
  and secured by a first priority perfected security interest in substantially all of the existing and future personal property of the
  Company and each Guarantor, subject to certain exceptions. The collateral security described above also secures certain banking
  services obligations and interest rate swaps and currency or other hedging obligations of the Company owing to any of the then
  existing lenders or any affiliates thereof. Concurrently with the Company’s entry into the Credit Agreement, the Company also
  entered into a seven year interest rate swap agreement with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., Co-Syndication Agent and lender under the
  Credit Agreement, on $100 million of borrowings under the Credit Agreement. The interest rate swap agreement matures in May
  2029.

  Outstanding borrowings at December 31, 2022 under the Credit Agreement were $239.5 million, consisting of current borrowings
  of $55 million and long-term debt of $184.5 million; while outstanding borrowings at December 31, 2021 under the 2015 Credit
  Agreement were $125.3 million, consisting of current borrowings. Letters of credit outstanding under the Credit Agreement were
  $2.4 million at December 31, 2022, and $2.6 million under the 2015 Credit Agreement at December 31, 2021. Borrowings at
  December 31, 2021 under the 2015 Credit Agreement have been classified as current liabilities based upon accounting rules and
  certain provisions in the agreement.

  At December 31, 2022, the weighted average interest rate under our Credit Agreement was 5.2%, which consisted of $237 million
  in borrowings at 5.2% under Term SOFR, adjusted for the impact of the interest rate swap agreement on $100 million of
  borrowings, and an alternative base rate borrowing of $2.5 million at 8%. At December 31, 2021, the weighted average interest
  rate on our 2015 Credit Agreement was 1.4%, which consisted of $125 million in direct borrowings at 1.4% and alternative base
  rate loan of $0.3 million at 3.5%. During the year ended December 31, 2022, our average daily alternative base rate loan balance
  was $5.6 million, compared to a balance of $1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021.

  The Credit Agreement contains customary covenants limiting, among other things, the incurrence of additional indebtedness, the
  creation of liens, mergers, consolidations, liquidations and dissolutions, sales of assets, dividends and other payments in respect of
  equity interests, acquisitions, investments, loans and guarantees, subject, in each case, to customary exceptions, thresholds and
  baskets. The Credit Agreement also contains customary events of default.

  In October 2022, our Polish subsidiary, SMP Poland sp. z.o.o., amended its overdraft facility with HSBC Continental Europe
  (Spolka Akcyjna) Oddzial w Polsce to provide for borrowings under the facility in Euros and U.S. Dollars. Under the amended
  terms, the overdraft facility provides for borrowings of up to Zloty 30 million (approximately $6.8 million) if borrowings are
  solely in Zloty, or up to 85% of the Zloty 30 million limit (approximately $5.8 million) if borrowings are in Euros and/or U.S.
  Dollars. The overdraft facility has an initial maturity date in December 2022, with automatic three-month renewals until June
  2027, subject to cancellation by either party, at its sole discretion, at least 30 days prior to the commencement of the three-month
  renewal period. Borrowings under the amended overdraft facility will bear interest at a rate equal to (1) the one month Warsaw
  Interbank Offered Rate (“WIBOR”) + 1.5% for borrowings in Polish Zloty, (2) the one month Euro Interbank Offered Rate
  (“EURIBOR”) + 1.5% for borrowings in Euros, and (3) the Mid-Point of the Fed Target Range + 1.75% for borrowings in U.S
  Dollars. Borrowings under the overdraft facility are guaranteed by Standard Motor Products, Inc., the ultimate parent company.
  At December 31, 2021, borrowings under the overdraft facility were Zloty 12.3 million (approximately $3 million). There were no
  borrowings outstanding under the overdraft facility at December 31, 2022.

  In order to reduce our accounts receivable balances and improve our cash flow, we are party to several supply chain financing
  arrangements, in which we may sell certain of our customers’ trade accounts receivable to such customers’ financial institutions.
  We sell our undivided interests in certain of these receivables at our discretion when we determine that the cost of these
  arrangements is less than the cost of servicing our receivables with existing debt. Under the terms of the agreements, we retain no
  rights or interest, have no obligations with respect to the sold receivables, and do not service the receivables after the sale. As
  such, these transactions are being accounted for as a sale.


                                                                    37

  Pursuant to these agreements, we sold $813.7 million and $818.8 million of receivables for the years ended December 31, 2022
  and 2021, respectively. Receivables presented at financial institutions and not yet collected as of December 31, 2021 were $1.3
  million and remained in our receivable balance as of that date. There were no receivables presented at financial institutions and not
  yet collected as of December 31, 2022. All receivables sold were reflected as a reduction of accounts receivable in the
  consolidated balance sheet at the time of sale. A charge in the amount of $32 million, $11.5 million and $12.2 million related to the
  sale of receivables is included in selling, general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of operations for the
  years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

  To the extent that these arrangements are terminated, our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity could
  be adversely affected by extended payment terms, delays or failures in collecting trade accounts receivables. The utility of the
  supply chain financing arrangements also depends upon a benchmark reference rate for the purpose of determining the discount
  rate applicable to each arrangement. If the benchmark reference rate increases significantly, we may be negatively impacted as we
  may not be able to pass these added costs on to our customers, which could have a material and adverse effect upon our financial
  condition, results of operations and cash flows.

  In January 2023, one of our customers filed a petition for bankruptcy. In connection with the bankruptcy filing, we evaluated our
  potential risk and exposure as related to our outstanding accounts receivable balance from the customer as of December 31, 2022,
  and estimated our anticipated recovery. As a result of our evaluation, we recorded a $7 million pre-tax charge during the year
  ended December 31, 2022 to reduce our accounts receivable balance to our estimated recovery. The $7 million pre-tax charge is
  included in selling, general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statement of operations. We will continue to monitor
  the circumstances surrounding the bankruptcy in determining whether additional provisions may be necessary.

  In March 2020, our Board of Directors authorized the purchase of up to $20 million of our common stock under a stock repurchase
  program. Stock repurchases under this program, during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, were 150,273 and 323,867
  shares of our common stock, respectively, at a total cost of $6.5 million and $13.5 million, respectively, thereby completing the
  2020 Board of Directors authorization.

  In February 2021, our Board of Directors authorized the purchase of up to an additional $20 million of our common stock under a
  stock repurchase program. Stock repurchases under this program, during the year ended December 31, 2021, were 464,992 shares
  of our common stock at a total cost of $20 million, thereby completing the 2021 Board of Directors authorization.

  In October 2021, our Board of Directors authorized the purchase of up to $30 million of our common stock under a stock
  repurchase program. Stock repurchases under this program, during the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 were 692,067 and
  7,000 shares of our common stock, respectively, at a total cost of $29.7 million and $0.3 million, respectively, thereby completing
  the October 2021 Board of Directors authorization.

  In July 2022, our Board of Directors authorized the purchase of up to an additional $30 million of our common stock under a new
  stock repurchase program. Stock will be purchased under the program from time to time, in the open market or through private
  transactions, as market conditions warrant. To date, there have been no repurchases of our common stock under the program.

  Material Cash Commitments

  Material cash commitments as of December 31, 2022 consist of required cash payments to service our outstanding borrowings of
  $239.5 million under our Credit Agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as agent, the future minimum cash requirements of
  $60.2 million through 2033 under operating leases, and future cash payments relating to our restructuring and integration activities
  of $4.9 million. All of our other cash commitments as of December 31, 2022 are not material. For additional information related
  to our material cash commitments, see Note 3, “Restructuring and Integration Expenses”, Note 7, “Leases,” and Note 11, “Credit
  Facilities and Long-Term Debt,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report.

  We anticipate that our cash flow from operations, available cash, and available borrowings under our Credit Agreement will be
  adequate to meet our future liquidity needs for at least the next twelve months. Significant assumptions underlie this belief,
  including, among other things, that we will be able to mitigate the future impact, if any, of disruptions in the supply chain caused
  by the COVID-19 pandemic, Russia’s invasion of the Ukraine and resultant sanctions imposed by the U.S. and other governments,
  future increases in interest rates, and significant inflationary cost increases in raw materials, labor and transportation that we are
  unable to pass through our customers, macroeconomic uncertainty, and that there will be no material adverse developments in our
  business, liquidity or capital requirements. If material adverse developments were to occur in any of these areas, there can be no
  assurance that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations, or that future borrowings will be available to us
  under our Credit Agreement in amounts sufficient to enable us to pay the principal and interest on our indebtedness, or to fund our
  other liquidity needs. In addition, if we default on any of our indebtedness, or breach any financial covenant in our Credit
  Agreement, our business could be adversely affected.

  For further information regarding the risks in our business, refer to Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” of this Report.

  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

  We have identified the two accounting policies and estimates below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of
  our results of operations. The impact and any associated risks related to these policies and estimates on our business operations is
  discussed throughout “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” where such
  policies and estimates affect our reported and expected financial results. For a detailed discussion on the application of these and
  other accounting policies, see Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
  Statements in Item 8 of this Report.

  You should be aware that preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that
  affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our consolidated
  financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. We can give no assurances
  that actual results will not differ from those estimates. Although we do not believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that there
  will be a material change in the future estimates, or in the assumptions that we use in calculating the estimates, the uncertain future
  effects, if any, of the disruptions in the supply chain caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, Russia’s invasion of the Ukraine and
  resultant sanctions imposed by the U.S. and other governments, future increases in interest rates, inflation, macroeconomic
  uncertainty, and other unforeseen changes in the industry, or business, could materially impact the estimates, and may have a
  material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

  Valuation of Long‑Lived and Intangible Assets and Goodwill

  At acquisition, we estimate and record the fair value of purchased intangible assets, which primarily consist of customer
  relationships, trademarks and trade names, patents, developed technology and intellectual property, and non-compete agreements.
  Intangible assets acquired through business combinations are subject to potential adjustments within the measurement period,
  which is up to one year from the acquisition date. Valuing intangible assets requires the use of significant estimates and
  assumptions. As related to valuing customer relationships, significant estimates and assumptions used include but are not limited
  to: (1) forecasted revenues attributable to existing customers; (2) forecasted earnings before interest and taxes (“EBIT”) margins;
  (3) customer attrition rates; and (4) the discount rate. Goodwill is the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of
  identifiable net assets acquired in business combinations. Goodwill and certain other intangible assets having indefinite lives are
  not amortized to earnings, but instead are subject to periodic testing for impairment. Intangible assets determined to have definite
  lives are amortized over their remaining useful lives. We believe that the fair value of acquired identifiable net assets, including
  intangible assets, are based upon reasonable estimates and assumptions.


                                                                     39

26/04/23, 10:13                      https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/93389/000114036123007960/brhc10048362_10k.htm
  Index

  We assess the impairment of long‑lived assets, identifiable intangibles assets and goodwill whenever events or changes in
  circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. With respect to goodwill and identifiable intangible assets
  having indefinite lives, we test for impairment on an annual basis or in interim periods if an event occurs or circumstances change
  that may indicate the fair value is below its carrying amount. Factors we consider important, which could trigger an impairment
  review, include the following: (a) significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results;
  (b) significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business; and (c) significant
  negative industry or economic trends. We review the fair values using the discounted cash flows method and market multiples.

  When performing our evaluation of goodwill for impairment, if we conclude qualitatively that it is not more likely than not that the
  fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then a quantitative impairment test would not be required. If we are
  unable to reach this conclusion, then we would perform a goodwill quantitative impairment test. In performing the quantitative
  test, the fair value of the reporting unit is compared to its carrying amount. A charge for impairment is recognized by the amount
  by which the reporting unit’s carrying amount exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the
  reporting unit.

  Identifiable intangible assets having indefinite lives are reviewed for impairment on an annual basis using a methodology similar
  with that used to evaluate goodwill. Intangible assets having definite lives and other long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment
  whenever events such as product discontinuance, plant closures, product dispositions or other changes in circumstances indicate
  that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. In reviewing for impairment, we compare the carrying value of such assets to
  the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected from the use of the assets and their eventual disposition. When the
  estimated undiscounted future cash flows are less than their carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognized equal to the
  difference between the assets fair value and their carrying value.

  There are inherent assumptions and estimates used in developing future cash flows requiring our judgment in applying these
  assumptions and estimates to the analysis of identifiable intangibles and long‑lived asset impairment including projecting
  revenues, interest rates, tax rates and the cost of capital. Many of the factors used in assessing fair value are outside our control
  and it is reasonably likely that assumptions and estimates will change in future periods. These changes can result in future
  impairments. In the event our planning assumptions were modified resulting in impairment to our assets, we would be required to
  include an expense in our statement of operations, which could materially impact our business, financial condition and results of
  operations.

  Asbestos Litigation

  In evaluating our potential asbestos-related liability, we have considered various factors including, among other things, an actuarial
  study of the asbestos related liabilities performed by an independent actuarial firm, our settlement amounts and whether there are
  any co-defendants, the jurisdiction in which lawsuits are filed, and the status and results of such claims. As is our accounting
  policy, we consider the advice of actuarial consultants with experience in assessing asbestos-related liabilities to estimate our
  potential claim liability; and perform an actuarial evaluation in the third quarter of each year and whenever events or changes in
  circumstances indicate that additional provisions may be necessary. The methodology used to project asbestos-related liabilities
  and costs in our actuarial study considered: (1) historical data available from publicly available studies; (2) an analysis of our
  recent claims history to estimate likely filing rates into the future; (3) an analysis of our currently pending claims; (4) an analysis
  of our settlements and awards of asbestos-related damages to date; and (5) an analysis of closed claims with pay ratios and lag
  patterns in order to develop average future settlement values. Based on the information contained in the actuarial study and all
  other available information considered by us, we have concluded that no amount within the range of settlement payments and
  awards of asbestos-related damages was more likely than any other and, therefore, in assessing our asbestos liability we compare
  the low end of the range to our recorded liability to determine if an adjustment is required. Future legal costs are expensed as
  incurred and reported in earnings (loss) from discontinued operations in the accompanying statement of operations.


                                                                    40

  We plan to perform an annual actuarial evaluation during the third quarter of each year for the foreseeable future and whenever
  events or changes in circumstances indicate that additional provisions may be necessary. Given the uncertainties associated with
  projecting such matters into the future and other factors outside our control, we can give no assurance that additional provisions
  will not be required. We will continue to monitor events and changes in circumstances surrounding these potential liabilities in
  determining whether to perform additional actuarial evaluations and whether additional provisions may be necessary, which will
  reported in earnings (loss) from discontinued operations in the accompanying statement of operations. At the present time,
  however, we do not believe that any additional provisions would be reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our
  liquidity or consolidated financial position. See Note 23, “Commitments and Contingencies,” of the Notes to Consolidated
  Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report for additional information.

  Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

  For a detailed discussion on recently issued accounting pronouncements and their impact on our consolidated financial statements,
  see Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this
  Report.

  ITEM 7A.        QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

  We are exposed to market risk, primarily related to foreign currency exchange and interest rates. These exposures are actively
  monitored by management. Our exposure to foreign exchange rate risk is due to certain costs, revenues and borrowings being
  denominated in currencies other than one of our subsidiary’s functional currency. Similarly, we are exposed to market risk as the
  result of changes in interest rates, which may affect the cost of our financing. It is our policy and practice to use derivative
  financial instruments only to the extent necessary to manage exposures. We do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments
  for trading or speculative purposes.

  Exchange Rate Risk

  We have exchange rate exposure, primarily, with respect to the Canadian Dollar, the Euro, the British Pound, the Polish Zloty, the
  Hungarian Forint, the Mexican Peso, the Taiwan Dollar, the Chinese Yuan Renminbi and the Hong Kong Dollar. As of December
  31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, our monetary assets and liabilities which are subject to this exposure are immaterial, therefore,
  the potential immediate loss to us that would result from a hypothetical 10% change in foreign currency exchange rates would not
  be expected to have a material impact on our earnings or cash flows. This sensitivity analysis assumes an unfavorable 10%
  fluctuation in the exchange rates affecting the foreign currencies in which monetary assets and liabilities are denominated and does
  not take into account the incremental effect of such a change on our foreign currency denominated revenues.

  Interest Rate Risk

  We manage our exposure to interest rate risk through the proportion of fixed rate debt and variable rate debt in our debt portfolio.
  To reduce our market risk for changes in interest rates on our variable rate borrowings, and to manage a portion of our exposure to
  changes in interest rates, we occasionally enter into interest rate swap agreements.

  In June 2022, we entered into a seven year interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of $100 million that is to mature in
  May 2029. The interest rate swap agreement has been designated as a cash flow hedge of interest payments on $100 million of
  borrowings under our Credit Agreement. Under the terms of the swap agreement, we will receive monthly variable interest
  payments based on one month Term SOFR and will pay interest based upon a fixed rate of 2.683% per annum, adjusted upward for
  the credit spread adjustment in the Credit Agreement of 0.10% and the loan margin in the Credit Agreement of 1.50% at December
  31, 2022.


                                                                   41

  Index

  As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately $239.5 million of outstanding borrowings under our credit facilities, of which
  approximately $139.5 million bears interest at variable rates of interest and $100 million bears interest at fixed rates, after
  consideration of the interest rate swap agreement entered into in June 2022. Additionally, we invest our excess cash in highly
  liquid short-term investments. Based upon our current level of borrowings under our facilities and our excess cash, the effect of a
  hypothetical, instantaneous and unfavorable change of 100 basis points in the interest rate may have an approximate $1.2 million
  annualized negative impact on our earnings or cash flows.

  In addition, we are party to several supply chain financing arrangements, in which we may sell certain of our customers’ trade
  accounts receivable to such customers’ financial institutions. We sell our undivided interests in certain of these receivables at our
  discretion when we determine that the cost of these arrangements is less than the cost of servicing our receivables with existing
  debt. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we sold $813.7 million of receivables. Depending upon the level of sales of
  receivables pursuant these agreements, the effect of a hypothetical, instantaneous and unfavorable change of 100 basis points in the
  margin rate may have an approximate $8.1 million negative impact on our earnings or cash flows. The charge related to the sale of
  receivables is included in selling, general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of operations.

                                    MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL
                                           OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING
  To the Stockholders of
  Standard Motor Products, Inc. and Subsidiaries:

  Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in
  Rule 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act). Our internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance to our
  management and Board of Directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements.

  All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Because of these inherent limitations, internal
  control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and
  presentation, and may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
  subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the
  policies or procedures may deteriorate.

  We assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. In making this
  assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in
  the 2013 Internal Control - Integrated Framework. Based on our assessment using those criteria, we concluded that, as of
  December 31, 2022, our internal control over financial reporting is effective.

  Our independent registered public accounting firm, KPMG LLP, has audited our consolidated financial statements as of and for the
  year ended December 31, 2022 and has also audited the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of
  December 31, 2022. KPMG’s report appears on the following pages of this “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary
  Data.”


                                                                   44

                         REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM –
                                INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

  To the Stockholders and Board of Directors
  Standard Motor Products, Inc. and Subsidiaries:

  Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

  We have audited Standard Motor Products, Inc and Subsidiaries’ (the “Company”) internal control over financial reporting as of
  December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of
  Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects,
  effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control –
  Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

  We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)
  (“PCAOB”), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated
  statements of operations, comprehensive income, changes in stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-
  year period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes and financial statement Schedule II, Valuation and Qualifying
  Accounts (collectively, the consolidated financial statements), and our report dated February 22, 2023 expressed an unqualified
  opinion on those consolidated financial statements.

  Basis for Opinion

  The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its
  assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on
  Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over
  financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be
  independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and
  regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

  We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the
  audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
  respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over
  financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating
  effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we
  considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

  Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

  A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
  reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally
  accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that

  Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,

  of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

                         REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM –
                                     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

  To the Stockholders and Board of Directors
  Standard Motor Products, Inc. and Subsidiaries:

  Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements

  We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Standard Motor Products, Inc. and Subsidiaries (the
  “Company”) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income,
  changes in stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three‑year period ended December 31, 2022, and the
  related notes and financial statement Schedule II Valuation and Qualifying Accounts (collectively, the “consolidated financial
  statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
  the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the
  three‑year period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

  We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)
  (“PCAOB”), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in
  Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
  Commission, and our report dated February 22, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s
  internal control over financial reporting.

  Basis for Opinion

  These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an
  opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the
  PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and
  the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

  We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the
  audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether
  due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated
  financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures
  included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our
  audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
  evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
  for our opinion.


                                                                     47

  Critical Audit Matter

  The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial
  statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or
  disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or
  complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated
  financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate
  opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.

          Asbestos liability and litigation

          As discussed in Notes 1 and 23 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company is involved in asbestos litigation and
          has a potential asbestos liability. As of December 31, 2022, the accrued asbestos liability was $68 million. The Company’s
          asbestos liability represents the low end of the actuarially determined range of the undiscounted liability for settlement
          payments and awards of asbestos related damages, excluding legal costs and any potential recovery from insurance carriers.

          We identified the assessment of the asbestos liability recorded as a critical audit matter. This required subjective auditor
          judgment, due to the nature of the estimate and assumptions, including the applicability of those assumptions to the current
          facts and circumstances, as well as judgments about future events and uncertainties. Specialized skills were needed to evaluate
          the Company’s key assumptions. The key assumptions included future claim filings, closed with pay ratios, closed with pay
          lag patterns, settlement values, large claims, and ratios of allocated loss adjustment exposure (ALAE) to indemnity. Minor
          changes to these key assumptions could have had a significant effect on the Company’s assessment of the accrual for the
          asbestos liability.

          The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and
          tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the asbestos liability estimation process. This included
          controls related to the key assumptions and the claims data utilized in the process, and the potential need for an updated
          actuarial valuation. We evaluated the asbestos related legal cases settled during the year and the number of open cases as of
          year-end by reading letters received directly from the Company’s external and internal legal counsel. We tested a selection of
          claims data used in the actuarial model by comparing the selection items to underlying claims documentation. We involved an
          actuarial professional with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in evaluating (1) the future claim filings assumption
          by developing an independent expectation and comparing it against the Company’s future claim filing assumption, and (2) the
          closed with pay ratios, closed with pay lag patterns, settlement values, large claims, and ratios of ALAE to indemnity by
          comparing them to the Company’s historical experience.

                                NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
  1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

  Principles of Consolidation

  Standard Motor Products, Inc. and subsidiaries (referred to hereinafter in these notes to the consolidated financial statements as
  “we,” “us,” “our,” “SMP,” or the “Company”) is a leading manufacturer and distributor of premium replacement parts utilized in
  the maintenance, repair and service of vehicles in the automotive aftermarket industry with a complementary focus on specialized
  equipments parts for manufacturers across multiple industries around the world.

  The consolidated financial statements include our accounts and all domestic and international companies in which we have more
  than a 50% equity ownership, except in instances where the minority shareholder maintains substantive participating rights, in
  which case we follow the equity method of accounting. In instances where we have more than a 50% equity ownership and the
  minority shareholder does not maintain substantive participating rights, our consolidated financial statements include the accounts
  of the company on a consolidated basis with its net income and equity reported at amounts attributable to both our equity position
  and that of the noncontrolling interest. Investments in unconsolidated affiliates are accounted for on the equity method, as we do
  not have a controlling financial interest but have the ability to exercise significant influence. All significant inter-company items
  have been eliminated.

  Use of Estimates

  The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires
  management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of
  contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and
  expenses during the reporting periods. We have made a number of estimates and assumptions in the preparation of these
  consolidated financial statements. We can give no assurances that actual results will not differ from those estimates. Although we
  do not believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates, or in the assumptions
  that we use in calculating the estimates, the uncertain future effects, if any, of disruptions in the supply chain caused by the
  COVID-19 pandemic, Russia’s invasion of the Ukraine and resultant sanctions imposed by the U.S. and other governments, future
  increases in interest rates, inflation, macroeconomic uncertainty, and other unforeseen changes in the industry, or business, could
  materially impact the estimates, and may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of
  operations. Some of the more significant estimates include allowances for expected credit losses, cash discounts, valuation of
  inventory, valuation of long-lived assets, goodwill and other intangible assets, depreciation and amortization of long-lived assets,
  product liability exposures, asbestos, environmental and litigation matters, valuation of deferred tax assets, share based
  compensation and sales returns and other allowances.

  Reclassification

  Certain prior period amounts in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes have been reclassified to
  conform to the 2022 presentation.

  Cash and Cash Equivalents

  We consider all highly liquid investments purchased with a maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.

  Allowance for Expected Credit Losses and Cash Discounts

  We do not generally require collateral for our trade accounts receivable. Accounts receivable have been reduced by an allowance
  for amounts that may become uncollectible in the future. These allowances are established based on a combination of write-off
  history, supportable forecasts, aging analysis, and specific account evaluations. When a receivable balance is known to be
  uncollectible, it is written off against the allowance for expected credit losses. In January 2023, one of our customers filed a
  petition for bankruptcy. In connection with the bankruptcy filing, we evaluated our potential risk and exposure as related to our
  outstanding accounts receivable balance from the customer as of December 31, 2022, and estimated our anticipated recovery. As a
  result of our evaluation, we recorded a $7 million pre-tax charge during the year ended December 31, 2022 to reduce our accounts
  receivable balance to our estimated recovery. We will continue to monitor the circumstances surrounding the bankruptcy in
  determining whether additional provisions may be necessary. Cash discounts are provided based on an overall average experience
  rate applied to qualifying accounts receivable balances.

  Inventories

  Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Cost is determined on the first-in first-out basis. Where
  appropriate, standard cost systems are utilized for purposes of determining cost; the standards are adjusted as necessary to ensure
  they approximate actual costs. Estimates of lower of cost and net realizable value of inventory are determined by comparing the
  actual cost of the product to the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business less reasonably predictable costs of
  completion, disposal and transportation of the inventory.

  We also evaluate inventories on a regular basis to identify inventory on hand that may be obsolete or in excess of current and
  future projected market demand. For inventory deemed to be obsolete, we provide a reserve on the full value of the inventory.
  Inventory that is in excess of current and projected use is reduced by an allowance to a level that approximates our estimate of
  future demand. Future projected demand requires management judgment and is based upon (a) our review of historical trends and
  (b) our estimate of projected customer specific buying patterns and trends in the industry and markets in which we do business.
  Using rolling twelve month historical information, we estimate future demand on a continuous basis. The historical volatility of
  such estimates has been minimal. We maintain provisions for inventory reserves of $42.5 million and $46.2 million as of
  December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

  We utilize cores (used parts) in our remanufacturing processes for air conditioning compressors, diesel injectors, and diesel
  pumps. The production of air conditioning compressors, diesel injectors, and diesel pumps involves the rebuilding of used cores,
  which we acquire either in outright purchases from used parts brokers, or from returns pursuant to an exchange program with
  customers. Under such exchange programs, at the time of sale of air conditioning compressors, diesel injectors, and diesel pumps,
  we estimate the core expected to be returned from the customer and record the estimated return as unreturned customer inventory.

  In addition, many of our customers can return inventory to us based upon customer warranty and overstock arrangements within
  customer specific limits. At the time products are sold, we accrue a liability for product warranties and overstock returns and
  record as unreturned customer inventory our estimate of anticipated customer returns. Estimates are based upon historical
  information on the nature, frequency and probability of the customer return. Unreturned core, warranty and overstock customer
  inventory is recorded at standard cost. Revision to these estimates is made when necessary, based upon changes in these factors.
  We regularly study trends of such claims.

  Property, Plant and Equipment

  Property, plant and equipment are recorded at historical cost and are depreciated using the straight-line method of depreciation
  over the estimated useful lives as follows:

                                                                                                        Estimated Life
  Buildings                                                                                            25 to 33-1/2 years
  Building improvements                                                                                  10 to 25 years
  Machinery and equipment                                                                                5 to 12 years
  Tools, dies and auxiliary equipment                                                                     3 to 8 years
  Furniture and fixtures                                                                                 3 to 12 years

  Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful life or the term of the lease. Costs related to
  maintenance and repairs which do not prolong the assets useful lives are expensed as incurred. We assess our property, plant and
  equipment to be held and used for impairment when indicators are present that the carrying value may not be recoverable.

  Leases

  We determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. For operating leases, we include and report operating lease right-of-use
  (“ROU”) assets, sundry payables and accrued expenses, and noncurrent operating lease liabilities on our consolidated balance
  sheet for leases with a term longer than twelve months. Finance leases are reported on our consolidated balance sheets in property,
  plant and equipment, current portion of other debt, and long-term debt.

  Operating lease ROU assets and operating lease liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present
  value of the total lease payments over the lease term. Our ROU assets represent the right to use an underlying leased asset over the
  existing lease term, and the corresponding lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease
  agreement. As most of our leases do not provide for an implicit rate, we use our secured incremental borrowing rate based on the
  information available when determining the present value of our lease payments. Our lease terms may include options to
  terminate, or extend, our lease when it is reasonably certain that we will execute the option. Lease agreements may contain lease
  and non-lease components, which are generally accounted for separately. Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line
  basis over the lease term.

  Valuation of Long-Lived and Intangible Assets and Goodwill

  At acquisition, we estimate and record the fair value of purchased intangible assets, which primarily consist of customer
  relationships, trademarks and trade names, patents, developed technology and intellectual property, and non-compete agreements.
  Intangible assets acquired through business combinations are subject to potential adjustments within the measurement period,
  which is up to one year from the acquisition date. Valuing intangible assets requires the use of significant estimates and
  assumptions. As related to valuing customer relationships, significant estimates and assumptions used include but are not limited
  to: (1) forecasted revenues attributable to existing customers; (2) forecasted earnings before interest and taxes (“EBIT”) margins;
  (3) customer attrition rates; and (4) the discount rate. Goodwill is the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of
  identifiable net assets acquired in business combinations. Goodwill and certain other intangible assets having indefinite lives are
  not amortized to earnings, but instead are subject to periodic testing for impairment. Intangible assets determined to have definite
  lives are amortized over their remaining useful lives. We believe that the fair value of acquired identifiable net assets, including
  intangible assets, are based upon reasonable estimates and assumptions.


                                                                   56

                             NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

  We assess the impairment of long‑lived assets, identifiable intangibles assets and goodwill whenever events or changes in
  circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. With respect to goodwill and identifiable intangible assets
  having indefinite lives, we test for impairment on an annual basis or in interim periods if an event occurs or circumstances change
  that may indicate the fair value is below its carrying amount. Factors we consider important, which could trigger an impairment
  review, include the following: (a) significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results;
  (b) significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business; and (c) significant
  negative industry or economic trends. We review the fair values using the discounted cash flows method and market multiples.

  When performing our evaluation of goodwill for impairment, if we conclude qualitatively that it is not more likely than not that the
  fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then a quantitative impairment test would not be required. If we are
  unable to reach this conclusion, then we would perform a goodwill quantitative impairment test. In performing the quantitative
  test, the fair value of the reporting unit is compared to its carrying amount. A charge for impairment is recognized by the amount
  by which the reporting unit’s carrying amount exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the
  reporting unit.

  Identifiable intangible assets having indefinite lives are reviewed for impairment on an annual basis using a methodology similar
  with that used to evaluate goodwill. Intangible assets having definite lives and other long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment
  whenever events such as product discontinuance, plant closures, product dispositions or other changes in circumstances indicate
  that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. In reviewing intangible assets having definite lives and other long-lived assets
  for impairment, we compare the carrying value of such assets to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected from the
  use of the assets and their eventual disposition. When the estimated undiscounted future cash flows are less than their carrying
  amount, an impairment loss is recognized equal to the difference between the assets fair value and their carrying value.

  There are inherent assumptions and estimates used in developing future cash flows requiring our judgment in applying these
  assumptions and estimates to the analysis of identifiable intangibles and long‑lived asset impairment including projecting
  revenues, interest rates, tax rates and the cost of capital. Many of the factors used in assessing fair value are outside our control
  and it is reasonably likely that assumptions and estimates will change in future periods. These changes can result in future
  impairments. In the event our planning assumptions were modified resulting in impairment to our assets, we would be required to
  include an expense in our statement of operations, which could materially impact our business, financial condition and results of
  operations.

  Foreign Currency Translation

  Assets and liabilities of our foreign operations are translated into U.S. dollars at year-end exchange rates. Income statement
  accounts are translated using the average exchange rates prevailing during the year. The resulting translation adjustments are
  recorded as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and remains there until the underlying
  foreign operation is liquidated or substantially disposed of. Foreign currency transaction gains or losses are recorded in the
  statement of operations under the caption “other non-operating income (expense), net.”

  Revenue Recognition

  We derive our revenue primarily from sales of replacement parts for motor vehicles from both our Engine Management and
  Temperature Control Segments. We recognize revenues when our performance obligation has been satisfied and the control of
  products has been transferred to a customer which typically occurs upon shipment. Revenue is measured as the amount of
  consideration we expect to receive in exchange for the transfer of goods or providing services. The amount of consideration we
  receive and revenue we recognize depends on the marketing incentives, product warranty and overstock returns we offer to our
  customers. For certain of our sales of remanufactured products, we also charge our customers a deposit for the return of a used
  core component which we can use in our future remanufacturing activities. Such deposit is not recognized as revenue at the time
  of the sale but rather carried as a core liability. At the same time, we estimate the core expected to be returned from the customer
  and record the estimated return as unreturned customer inventory. The liability is extinguished when a core is actually returned to
  us, or at period end when we estimate and recognize revenue for the core deposits not expected to be returned. We estimate and
  record provisions for cash discounts, quantity rebates, sales returns and warranties in the period the sale is recorded, based upon
  our prior experience and current trends. Significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in estimating
  sales returns and allowances relating to revenue recognized in any accounting period.

  Product Warranty and Overstock Returns

  Many of our products carry a warranty ranging from a 90-day limited warranty to a lifetime limited warranty, which generally
  covers defects in materials or workmanship and failure to meet industry published specifications and/or the result of installation
  error. In addition to warranty returns, we also permit our customers to return new, undamaged products to us within customer-
  specific limits (which are generally limited to a specified percentage of their annual purchases from us) in the event that they have
  overstocked their inventories. At the time products are sold, we accrue a liability for product warranties and overstock returns as a
  percentage of sales based upon estimates established using historical information on the nature, frequency and average cost of the
  claim and the probability of the customer return. At the same time, we record an estimate of anticipated customer returns as
  unreturned customer inventory. Significant judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing the
  sales returns and other allowances in any accounting period. Revision to these estimates is made when necessary, based upon
  changes in these factors. We regularly study trends of such claims.

  New Customer Acquisition Costs

  New customer acquisition costs refer to arrangements pursuant to which we incur change-over costs to induce a new customer to
  switch from a competitor’s brand. In addition, change-over costs include the costs related to removing the new customer’s
  inventory and replacing it with our inventory commonly referred to as a stock lift. New customer acquisition costs are recorded as
  a reduction to revenue when incurred.

  Selling, General and Administration Expenses

  Selling, general and administration expenses include shipping costs and advertising, which are expensed as incurred. Shipping and
  handling charges, as well as freight to customers, are included in distribution expenses as part of selling, general and
  administration expenses.


                                                                    58

  Deferred Financing Costs

  Deferred financing costs represent costs incurred in conjunction with our debt financing activities. Deferred financing costs
  related to our revolving credit facility are capitalized and amortized over the life of the related financing arrangement. If the debt
  is retired early, the related unamortized deferred financing costs are written off in the period the debt is retired and are recorded in
  the statement of operations under the caption other non-operating income (expense), net.

  Accounting for Income Taxes

  Income taxes are calculated using the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the
  estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets
  and liabilities, as measured by the current enacted tax rates.

  We maintain valuation allowances when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred asset will not be realized. In
  determining whether a valuation allowance is warranted, we consider all positive and negative evidence and all sources of taxable
  income such as prior earnings history, expected future earnings, carryback and carryforward periods and tax strategies to estimate
  if sufficient future taxable income will be generated to realize the deferred tax asset. The assessment of the adequacy of our
  valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction in which we operate and the period over which our
  deferred tax assets will be recoverable. In the event that actual results differ from these estimates, or we adjust these estimates in
  future periods for current trends or expected changes in our estimating assumptions, we may need to modify the level of valuation
  allowance which could materially impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.

  The valuation allowance of $3.2 million as of December 31, 2022 is intended to provide for the uncertainty regarding the ultimate
  realization of our U.S. foreign tax credit carryovers and foreign net operating loss carryovers. Based on these considerations, we
  believe it is more likely than not that we will realize the benefit of the net deferred tax asset of $33.7 million as of December 31,
  2022, which is net of the remaining valuation allowance.

  Tax benefits are recognized for an uncertain tax position when, in management's judgment, it is more likely than not that the
  position will be sustained upon examination by a taxing authority. For a tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not
  recognition threshold, the tax benefit is measured as the largest amount that is judged to have a greater than 50% likelihood of
  being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority. The liability associated with unrecognized tax benefits is adjusted
  periodically due to changing circumstances and when new information becomes available. Such adjustments are recognized
  entirely in the period in which they are identified. During the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, we did not
  establish a liability for uncertain tax positions.

  Environmental Reserves

  We are subject to various U.S. Federal and state and local environmental laws and regulations and are involved in certain
  environmental remediation efforts. We estimate and accrue our liabilities resulting from such matters based upon a variety of
  factors including the assessments of environmental engineers and consultants who provide estimates of potential liabilities and
  remediation costs. Such estimates are not discounted to reflect the time value of money due to the uncertainty in estimating the
  timing of the expenditures, which may extend over several years. Potential recoveries from insurers or other third parties of
  environmental remediation liabilities are recognized independently from the recorded liability, and any asset related to the recovery
  will be recognized only when the realization of the claim for recovery is deemed probable.


                                                                     59

  Asbestos Litigation

  In evaluating our potential asbestos-related liability, we have considered various factors including, among other things, an actuarial
  study of the asbestos related liabilities performed by an independent actuarial firm, our settlement amounts and whether there are
  any co-defendants, the jurisdiction in which lawsuits are filed, and the status and results of such claims. As is our accounting
  policy, we consider the advice of actuarial consultants with experience in assessing asbestos-related liabilities to estimate our
  potential claim liability; and perform an actuarial evaluation in the third quarter of each year and whenever events or changes in
  circumstances indicate that additional provisions may be necessary. The methodology used to project asbestos-related liabilities
  and costs in our actuarial study considered: (1) historical data available from publicly available studies; (2) an analysis of our
  recent claims history to estimate likely filing rates into the future; (3) an analysis of our currently pending claims; (4) an analysis
  of our settlements and awards of asbestos-related damages to date; and (5) an analysis of closed claims with pay ratios and lag
  patterns in order to develop average future settlement values. Based on the information contained in the actuarial study and all
  other available information considered by us, we have concluded that no amount within the range of settlement payments and
  awards of asbestos-related damages was more likely than any other and, therefore, in assessing our asbestos liability we compare
  the low end of the range to our recorded liability to determine if an adjustment is required. Future legal costs are expensed as
  incurred and reported in earnings (loss) from discontinued operations in the accompanying statement of operations.

  We plan to perform an annual actuarial evaluation during the third quarter of each year for the foreseeable future and whenever
  events or changes in circumstances indicate that additional provisions may be necessary. Given the uncertainties associated with
  projecting such matters into the future and other factors outside our control, we can give no assurance that additional provisions
  will not be required. We will continue to monitor events and changes in circumstances surrounding these potential liabilities in
  determining whether to perform additional actuarial evaluations and whether additional provisions may be necessary, which will
  reported in earnings (loss) from discontinued operations in the accompanying statement of operations. At the present time,
  however, we do not believe that any additional provisions would be reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our
  liquidity or consolidated financial position.

  Loss Contingencies

  We have loss contingencies, for such matters as legal claims and legal proceedings. Establishing loss reserves for these matters
  requires estimates, judgment of risk exposure and ultimate liability. We record provisions when the liability is considered probable
  and reasonably estimable. Significant judgment is required for both the determination of probability and the determination as to
  whether an exposure can be reasonably estimated. We maintain an ongoing monitoring and identification process to assess how
  the activities are progressing against the accrued estimated costs. As additional information becomes available, we reassess our
  potential liability related to these matters. Adjustments to the liabilities are recorded in the statement of operations in the period
  when additional information becomes available. Such revisions of the potential liabilities could have a material adverse effect on
  our business, financial condition or results of operations.

  Concentrations of Credit Risk

  Financial instruments that potentially subject us to significant concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash investments,
  accounts receivable and derivative financial instruments used to reduce our market risk for changes in interest rates on our variable
  rate borrowings. We place our cash investments with high quality financial institutions and limit the amount of credit exposure to
  any one institution. Derivative financial instruments used to reduce our market risk for changes in interest rates on our variable
  rate borrowings are entered into with high quality financial institutions, with their credit worthiness reviewed on a quarterly basis.
  Although we are directly affected by developments in the vehicle parts industry, management does not believe significant credit
  risk exists.

                                  STANDARD MOTOR PRODUCTS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

                              NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)
  With respect to accounts receivable, such receivables are primarily from warehouse distributors and major retailers in the
  automotive aftermarket industry located in the U.S. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers’ financial conditions.
  A significant portion of our net sales are concentrated from our three largest individual customers. The loss of one or more of these
  customers or, a significant reduction in purchases of our products from any one of them, could have a materially adverse impact on
  our business, financial condition and results of operations.

  In January 2023, one of our customers filed a petition for bankruptcy. In connection with the bankruptcy filing, we evaluated our
  potential risk and exposure as related to our outstanding accounts receivable balance from the customer as of December 31, 2022,
  and estimated our anticipated recovery. As a result of our evaluation, we recorded a $7 million pre-tax charge during the year
  ended December 31, 2022 to reduce our accounts receivable balance to our estimated recovery. The $7 million pre-tax charge is
  included in selling, general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statement of operations. We will continue to monitor
  the circumstances surrounding the bankruptcy in determining whether additional provisions may be necessary.

  For further information on net sales to our three largest customers and our concentration our customer risk, see Note 21, “Industry
  Segment and Geographic Data.”

  Foreign Cash Balances

  Substantially all of the cash and cash equivalents, including foreign cash balances, at December 31, 2022 and 2021 were
  uninsured. Foreign cash balances at December 31, 2022 and 2021 were $18.5 million and $16.6 million, respectively.

  Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

  We occasionally use derivative financial instruments to reduce our market risk for changes in interest rates on our variable rate
  borrowings. Derivative financial instruments are recorded at fair value in other current and long-term assets, and other current and
  long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. For derivative financial instruments that have been formally designated as
  cash flow interest rate hedges (“interest rate swap agreements”), provided that the hedging instrument is highly effective, the entire
  change in the fair value of the derivative will be deferred and recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”) in
  the consolidated balance sheets. When the underlying hedged transaction is realized (i.e., when the interest payments on the
  underlying borrowing are recognized in the consolidated statements of operations), the gain/loss included in AOCI is recorded in
  earnings and reflected on the same line as the gain/loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk (i.e., interest expense). At
  the inception of each transaction, we formally document the hedge relationship, including the identification of the hedge
  instrument, the related hedged items, the effectiveness of the hedge, as well as its risk management objectives and strategies.

  2. Business Acquisitions and Investments

  2022 Increase in Equity Investment

  Investment in Foshan Che Yijia New Energy Technology Co., Ltd.

  In August 2019, we acquired an approximate 29% minority interest in Foshan Che Yijia New Energy Technology Co., Ltd.
  (“CYJ”) for approximately $5.1 million. CYJ is a manufacturer of automotive electric air conditioning compressors and is located
  in China. We determined, at that time, that due to a lack of a voting majority and other qualitative factors, we do not control the
  operations of CYJ and accordingly, our investment in CYJ would be accounted for under the equity method of accounting.

  In October 2022, we acquired an additional 3.55% equity interest in CYJ for RMB 1.7 million (approximately $242,000),
  increasing our minority ownership interest in CYJ from an approximate interest of 29% to 33%. The additional acquired ownership
  interest in CYJ was paid for in cash funded by borrowings under our Credit Agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as
  agent. We will continue to account for our minority interest in CYJ using the equity method of accounting.

  Intangible assets acquired of $54.7 million consist of customer relationships of $39.4 million that will be amortized on a straight-
  line basis over the estimated useful life of 20 years; developed technology of $13.4 million that will be amortized on a straight-line
  basis over the estimated useful life of 15 years; and a trade name of $1.9 million that will be amortized on a straight-line basis over
  the estimated useful life of 10 years. Goodwill of $49.3 million was allocated to the Engine Management Segment. The goodwill
  reflects relationships, business specific knowledge and the replacement cost of an assembled workforce associated with personal
  reputations. The intangible assets and goodwill are not deductible for tax purposes.

  Incremental revenues from the acquired Trombetta business included in our consolidated statement of operations for the year
  ended December 31, 2022 were $27.4 million.

  Acquisition of Particulate Matter Sensor Business of Stoneridge, Inc. (“Soot Sensor”)

  In March 2021 and November 2021, we agreed to acquire certain Soot Sensor product lines from Stoneridge, Inc for $2.9 million.
  The acquired product lines were paid for with cash funded by borrowings under our revolving credit facility with JPMorgan Chase
  Bank, N.A. The assets acquired include inventory, machinery, and equipment and certain intangible assets.

  The product lines acquired are used to manufacture sensors used in the exhaust and emission systems of diesel engines. The
  product lines acquired were located in Stoneridge’s facilities in Lexington, Ohio and Tallinn, Estonia. We did not acquire these
  facilities, nor any of Stoneridge’s employees, and have substantially completed the relocation of the acquired inventory, machinery
  and equipment related to the production lines to our engine management plants in Independence, Kansas and Bialystok, Poland,
  respectively. The acquisition, reported as part of our Engine Management Segment, aligns with our strategy of expansion into the
  OE heavy duty market. Customer relationships to be acquired include Volvo, CNHi and Hino.

              2022.

  Restructuring Costs

  Cost Reduction Initiative

  During the fourth quarter of 2022, to further our ongoing efforts to improve operating efficiencies and reduce costs, we announced
  plans for a reduction in our sales force, and initiated plans to relocate certain product lines from our Independence, Kansas
  manufacturing facility in our Engine Management segment and from our St. Thomas, Canada manufacturing facility in our
  Temperature Control segment to our manufacturing facilities in Reynosa, Mexico.

  Total restructuring expenses related to the initiative of approximately $1.5 million were incurred during the year ended December
  31, 2022 consisting of (1) expenses of approximately $0.9 million related to our sales force reduction, and (2) expenses of
  approximately $0.6 million consisting of employee severance related to our product line relocations. Total future restructuring
  costs related to the initiative and expected to be incurred are approximately $3.4 million. We anticipate that the Cost Reduction
  Initiative will be completed by the end of 2023.

  Plant Rationalization Programs

  The 2016 Plant Rationalization Program, which included the shutdown and sale of our Grapevine, Texas facility, and the 2017
  Orlando Rationalization Program, which included the shutdown of our Orlando, Florida facility, has been completed. Cash
  payments made of $16,000 and $100,000 during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, consists of severance
  payments to former employees terminated in connection with these programs. There is no remaining aggregate liability related to
  these programs as of December 31, 2022.

  Integration Costs

  Particulate Matter Sensor (“Soot Sensor”) Product Line Relocation

  In connection with our acquisitions in March 2021 and November 2021 of certain soot sensor product lines from Stoneridge, Inc.,
  we incurred certain integration expenses in connection with the relocation of certain inventory, machinery, and equipment from
  Stoneridge’s facilities in Lexington, Ohio and Tallinn, Estonia to our existing facilities in Independence, Kansas and Bialystok,
  Poland, respectively. Integration expenses recognized and cash payments made of $144,000 and $392,000, during the years ended
  December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, related to these relocation activities in our Engine Management segment.The soot
  sensor product line relocation has been substantially completed and there is no remaining aggregate liability related to the soot
  sensor product line relocation as of December 31, 2022.

  4. Sale of Receivables

  We are party to several supply chain financing arrangements, in which we may sell certain of our customers’ trade accounts
  receivable to such customers’ financial institutions. We sell our undivided interests in certain of these receivables at our discretion
  when we determine that the cost of these arrangements is less than the cost of servicing our receivables with existing debt. Under
  the terms of the agreements, we retain no rights or interest, have no obligations with respect to the sold receivables, and do not
  service the receivables after the sale. As such, these transactions are being accounted for as a sale.

  Pursuant to these agreements, we sold $813.7 million and $818.8 million of receivables for the years ended December 31, 2022
  and 2021, respectively. Receivables presented at financial institutions and not yet collected as of December 31, 2021 were $1.3
  million and remained in our accounts receivable balance as of that date. There were no receivables presented at financial
  institutions and not yet collected as of December 31, 2022. All receivables sold were reflected as a reduction of accounts
  receivable in the consolidated balance sheet at the time of sale. A charge in the amount of $32 million, $11.5 million and $12.2
  million related to the sale of receivables is included in selling, general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements
  of operations for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

  To the extent that these arrangements are terminated, our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity could
  be adversely affected by extended payment terms, delays or failures in collecting trade accounts receivables. The utility of the
  supply chain financing arrangements also depends upon a benchmark reference rate for the purpose of determining the discount
  rate applicable to each arrangement. If the benchmark reference rate increases significantly, we may be negatively impacted as we
  may not be able to pass these added costs on to our customers, which could have a material and adverse effect upon our financial
  condition, results of operations and cash flows.

  7. Leases

  Quantitative Lease Disclosures

  We have operating and finance leases for our manufacturing facilities, warehouses, office space, automobiles, and certain
  equipment. Our leases have remaining lease terms of up to eleven years, some of which may include one or more five-year
  renewal options. We have not included any of the renewal options in our operating lease payments, as we concluded that it is not
  reasonably certain that we will exercise any of these renewal options. Leases with an initial term of twelve months or less are not
  recorded on the balance sheet. Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Finance leases
  are not material.

  8. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

  Goodwill

  We assess the impairment of long‑lived and identifiable intangibles assets and goodwill whenever events or changes in
  circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. With respect to goodwill, we test for impairment on an
  annual basis or in interim periods if an event occurs or circumstances change that may indicate the fair value of a reporting unit is
  below its carrying amount. We completed our annual impairment test of goodwill as of December 31, 2022.

26/04/23, 10:13                      https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/93389/000114036123007960/brhc10048362_10k.htm

  When performing our evaluation of goodwill for impairment, if we conclude qualitatively that it is not more likely than not that the
  fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then a quantitative impairment test would not be required. If we are
  unable to reach this conclusion, then we would perform a goodwill quantitative impairment test. In performing the quantitative
  test, the fair value of the reporting unit is compared to its carrying amount. A charge for impairment is recognized by the amount
  by which the reporting unit’s carrying amount exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the
  reporting unit.

                             NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

  In light of the negative year-over-year impact on our company’s performance in the year ended December 31, 2022 of inflationary
  cost increases in raw materials, labor, transportation and freight costs, and the increase in interest rates, and the recent decline in
  our stock price, we elected to bypass the qualitative assessment at December 31, 2022 and have decided to perform a quantitative
  impairment test for goodwill at both the Engine Management and Temperature Control reporting units. The fair values of the
  Engine Management and Temperature Control reporting units were determined based upon the Income Approach, which estimates
  the fair value based on future discounted cash flows, and the Market Approach, which estimates the fair value based on market
  prices of comparable companies. We base our fair value estimates on projected financial information which we believe to be
  reasonable. We also considered our total market capitalization as of December 31, 2022. Our December 31, 2022 annual goodwill
  impairment analysis did not result in an impairment charge as it was determined that the fair values of our Engine Management
  and Temperature Control reporting units were in excess of their carrying amounts. While the fair values exceed the carrying
  amounts at the present time and we do not believe that impairments are probable, we will need to maintain the ongoing
  performance of the business at current projected levels in future periods to sustain their carrying values.

  Changes in the carrying values of goodwill by operating segment during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 are as
  follows (in thousands):

                             NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

  Investment in Foshan Che Yijia New Energy Technology Co., Ltd.

  In August 2019, we acquired an approximate 29% minority interest in Foshan Che Yijia New Energy Technology Co., Ltd.
  (“CYJ”) for approximately $5.1 million. CYJ is a manufacturer of automotive electric air conditioning compressors and is located
  in China. Our minority interest in CYJ is accounted for using the equity method of accounting.

  In December 2021, Standard Motor Products (Hong Kong), Ltd., (“SMP HK”), a subsidiary of Standard Motor Products, Inc.,
  entered into an unsecured loan agreement with CYJ. Under the terms of the loan agreement, CYJ shall have the right to borrow
  from SMP HK, as lender, up to an aggregate principal amount of $4 million, with interest calculated on the basis of simple interest
  of five percent (5%) per annum and a maturity date of November 30, 2023, subject to extension by SMP HK at its sole discretion.
  At December 31, 2022, outstanding borrowings under the loan agreement were $4 million.

  In October 2022, we acquired an additional 3.55% equity interest in CYJ for RMB 1.7 million (approximately $242,000),
  increasing our minority ownership interest in CYJ from an approximate interest of 29% to 33%. We will continue to account for
  our minority interest in CYJ using the equity method of accounting. During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021,
  purchases we made from CYJ were not material.

  Investment in Foshan FGD SMP Automotive Compressor Co. Ltd.

  In November 2017, we formed Foshan FGD SMP Automotive Compressor Co., Ltd., a 50/50 joint venture with Foshan
  Guangdong Automotive Air Conditioning Co., Ltd. (“FGD”), a China-based manufacturer of automotive belt driven air
  conditioning compressors. We acquired our 50% interest in the joint venture for approximately $12.5 million. We determined that
  due to a lack of a voting majority, and other qualitative factors, we do not control the operations of the joint venture and
  accordingly, our investment in the joint venture is accounted for under the equity method of accounting. During the years ended
  December 31, 2022 and 2021, we made purchases from the joint venture of approximately $53.3 million and $32.2 million,
  respectively.

  Investment in Foshan GWOYNG SMP Vehicle Climate Control & Cooling Products Co. Ltd.

  In April 2014, we formed Foshan GWOYNG SMP Vehicle Climate Control & Cooling Products Co. Ltd., a 50/50 joint venture
  with Gwo Yng Enterprise Co., Ltd. (“Gwo Yng”), a China-based manufacturer of automotive air conditioner accumulators, filter
  driers, hose assemblies and switches. We acquired our 50% interest in the joint venture for $14 million. We determined, at that
  time, that due to a lack of a voting majority and other qualitative factors, we do not control the operations of the joint venture and
  accordingly, our investment in the joint venture was accounted for under the equity method of accounting.

  In March 2018, we acquired an additional 15% equity interest in the joint venture for approximately $4.2 million, thereby
  increasing our equity interest in the joint venture to 65%. Although we increased our equity interest in the joint venture to 65%,
  the minority shareholder maintained participating rights that allowed it to participate in certain significant financial and operating
  decisions that occur in the ordinary course of business. As a result of the existence of these substantive participating rights of the
  minority shareholder, we continued to account for our investment in the joint venture under the equity method of accounting.
  During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we made purchases from the joint venture of approximately $16.1 million
  and $15.9 million, respectively.

  Investment in Orange Electronic Co. Ltd.

  In January 2013, we acquired a minority interest in Orange Electronic Co., Ltd. (“Orange”) for $6.3 million. Orange is a
  manufacturer of tire pressure monitoring system sensors and is located in Taiwan. As of December 31, 2022, our minority interest
  in Orange of 19.4% is accounted for using the equity method of accounting as we have the ability to exercise significant influence.
  During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we made purchases from Orange of approximately $4.1 million and $7.8
  million, respectively.

  Term Loan and Revolving Credit Facilities

  credit under the revolving credit facility from $250 million to $300 million, and updated the benchmark provisions to replace
  LIBOR with Term SOFR as the reference rate.

                             NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)


  In June 2022, the Company entered into a new Credit Agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, and a
  syndicate of lenders (the “Credit Agreement”). The Credit Agreement provides for a $500 million credit facility comprised of a
  $100 million term loan facility (the “term loan”) and a $400 million multi-currency revolving credit facility available in U.S.
  Dollars, Euros, Sterling, Swiss Francs, Canadian Dollars and other currencies as agreed to by the administrative agent and the
  lenders (the “revolving facility”). The Credit Agreement replaces and refinances the 2015 Credit Agreement.

  Borrowings under the Credit Agreement were used to repay all outstanding borrowings under the 2015 Credit Agreement, and pay
  certain fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Credit Agreement, with future borrowings used for other general
  corporate purposes of the Company and its subsidiaries. The term loan amortizes in quarterly installments of 1.25% in each of the
  first four years, and quarterly installments of 2.5% in the fifth year of the Credit Agreement. The revolving facility has a $25
  million sub-limit for the issuance of letters of credit and a $25 million sub-limit for the borrowing of swingline loans. The maturity
  date is June 1, 2027. The Company may request up to two one-year extensions of the maturity date.

  The Company may, upon the agreement of one or more then existing lenders or of additional financial institutions not currently
  party to the Credit Agreement, increase the revolving facility commitments or obtain incremental term loans by an aggregate
  amount not to exceed (x) the greater of (i) $168 million or (ii) 100% of consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Agreement)
  for the four fiscal quarters ended most recently before such date, plus (y) the amount of any voluntary prepayment of term loans,
  plus (z) an unlimited amount so long as, immediately after giving effect thereto, the pro forma First Lien Net Leverage Ratio (as
  defined in the Credit Agreement) does not exceed 2.5 to 1.0.

  Term loan and revolver facility borrowings in U.S. Dollars bear interest, at the Company’s election, at a rate per annum equal to
  Term SOFR plus 0.10% plus an applicable margin, or an alternate base rate plus an applicable margin, where the alternate base rate
  is the greater of the prime rate, the federal funds effective rate plus 0.50%, and one-month Term SOFR plus 0.10% plus 1.00%.
  Term loan borrowings are being made at one-month Term SOFR. The applicable margin for the term benchmark borrowings
  ranges from 1.0% to 2.0%, and the applicable margin for alternate base rate borrowings ranges from 0% to 1.0%, in each case,
  based on the total net leverage ratio of the Company and its restricted subsidiaries. The Company may select interest periods of
  one, three or six months for Term SOFR borrowings. Interest is payable at the end of the selected interest period, but no less
  frequently than quarterly.

  The Company’s obligations under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by its material domestic subsidiaries (each, a “Guarantor”),
  and secured by a first priority perfected security interest in substantially all of the existing and future personal property of the
  Company and each Guarantor, subject to certain exceptions. The collateral security described above also secures certain banking
  services obligations and interest rate swaps and currency or other hedging obligations of the Company owing to any of the then
  existing lenders or any affiliates thereof. Concurrently with the Company’s entry into the Credit Agreement, the Company also
  entered into a seven year interest rate swap agreement with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., Co-Syndication Agent and lender under the
  Credit Agreement, on $100 million of borrowings under the Credit Agreement. The interest rate swap agreement matures in May
  2029.

  Outstanding borrowings at December 31, 2022 under the Credit Agreement were $239.5 million, consisting of current borrowings
  of $55 million and long-term debt of $184.5 million; while outstanding borrowings at December 31, 2021 under the 2015 Credit
  Agreement were $125.3 million, consisting of current borrowings. Letters of credit outstanding under the Credit Agreement were
  $2.4 million at December 31, 2022, and $2.6 million under the 2015 Credit Agreement at December 31, 2021. Borrowings at
  December 31, 2021 under the 2015 Credit Agreement have been classified as current liabilities based upon accounting rules and
  certain provisions in the agreement.

  The Credit Agreement contains customary covenants limiting, among other things, the incurrence of additional indebtedness, the
  creation of liens, mergers, consolidations, liquidations and dissolutions, sales of assets, dividends and other payments in respect of
  equity interests, acquisitions, investments, loans and guarantees, subject, in each case, to customary exceptions, thresholds and
  baskets. The Credit Agreement also contains customary events of default.

  Polish Overdraft Facility

  In October 2022, our Polish subsidiary, SMP Poland sp. z.o.o., amended its overdraft facility with HSBC Continental Europe
  (Spolka Akcyjna) Oddzial w Polsce to provide for borrowings under the facility in Euros and U.S. Dollars. Under the amended
  terms, the overdraft facility provides for borrowings of up to Zloty 30 million (approximately $6.8 million) if borrowings are
  solely in Zloty, or up to 85% of the Zloty 30 million limit (approximately $5.8 million) if borrowings are in Euros and/or U.S.
  Dollars. The overdraft facility has an initial maturity date in December 2022, with automatic three-month renewals until June
  2027, subject to cancellation by either party, at its sole discretion, at least 30 days prior to the commencement of the three-month
  renewal period. Borrowings under the amended overdraft facility will bear interest at a rate equal to (1) the one month Warsaw
  Interbank Offered Rate (“WIBOR”) + 1.5% for borrowings in Polish Zloty, (2) the one month Euro Interbank Offered Rate
  (“EURIBOR”) + 1.5% for borrowings in Euros, and (3) the Mid-Point of the Fed Target Range + 1.75% for borrowings in U.S
  Dollars. Borrowings under the overdraft facility are guaranteed by Standard Motor Products, Inc., the ultimate parent company.
  At December 31, 2021 borrowings under the overdraft facility were Zloty 12.3 million (approximately $3 million). There were no
  borrowings outstanding under the overdraft facility at December 31, 2022.

  Deferred Financing Costs

  We have deferred financing costs of approximately $2.1 million and $0.4 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
  Deferred financing costs are related to our term loan and revolving credit facilities. In connection with the amendment to the 2015
  Credit Agreement entered into in March 2022 and the Credit Agreement entered into in June 2022 with JPMorgan Chase Bank,
  N.A., as agent, we incurred and capitalized approximately $0.2 million, and $1.9 million, respectively, of deferred financing costs
  related to bank, legal, and other professional fees which are being amortized, along with certain preexisting deferred financing
  costs, through June 2027, the term of the Credit Agreement. In addition, upon entering into the Credit Agreement, we wrote-off
  $40,000 of unamortized deferred financing costs associated with the 2015 Credit Agreement. Unamortized deferred financing
  costs written-off in June 2022 were recorded in other non-operating income (expense), net in our consolidated statement of
  operations.

  each series. In December 1995, our Board of Directors established a new series of preferred shares designated as Series A
  Participating Preferred Stock. The number of shares constituting the Series A Preferred Stock is 30,000. The Series A Preferred
  Stock is designed to participate in dividends, ranks senior to our common stock as to dividends and liquidation rights and has
  voting rights. Each share of the Series A Preferred Stock shall entitle the holder to one thousand votes on all matters submitted to a
  vote of the stockholders of the Company. No such shares were outstanding at December 31, 2022 and 2021.

  In March 2020, our Board of Directors authorized the purchase of up to $20 million of our common stock under a stock repurchase
  program. Stock repurchases under this program, during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, were 150,273 and 323,867
  shares of our common stock, respectively, at a total cost of $6.5 million and $13.5 million, respectively, thereby completing the
  2020 Board of Directors authorization.

  In February 2021, our Board of Directors authorized the purchase of up to an additional $20 million of our common stock under a
  stock repurchase program. Stock repurchases under this program, during the year ended December 31, 2021, were 464,992 shares
  of our common stock at a total cost of $20 million, thereby completing the February 2021 Board of Directors authorization.

  In October 2021, our Board of Directors authorized the purchase of up to an additional $30 million of our common stock under a
  stock repurchase program. Stock repurchases under this program, during the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2022 were 7,000
  and 692,067 shares of our common stock, respectively, at a total cost of $0.3 million and $29.7 million, respectively, thereby
  completing the October 2021 Board of Directors authorization.

  In July 2022, our Board of Directors authorized the purchase of up to an additional $30 million of our common stock under a new
  stock repurchase program. Stock will be purchased under the program from time to time, in the open market or through private
  transactions, as market conditions warrant. To date, there have been no repurchases of our common stock under the program.

  14. Stock-Based Compensation Plans

  Our stock-based compensation program is a broad-based program designed to attract and retain employees while also aligning
  employees’ interests with the interests of our shareholders. In addition, members of our Board of Directors participate in our
  stock-based compensation program in connection with their service on our board.

  In May 2021, our Board of Directors and Shareholders approved an amendment and restatement to the 2016 Omnibus Incentive
  Plan (the “Plan”). Under the Plan, which terminates in May 2026, we are authorized to issue, among other things, shares of
  restricted and performance-based stock to eligible employees and restricted stock to directors of up to 2,050,000 shares; and shares
  of restricted and performance-based stock to nonemployee directors of up to 350,000 shares. Shares issued under the Plan that are
  cancelled, forfeited or expire by their terms are eligible to be granted again under the Plan. The 2016 Omnibus Incentive Plan is
  the only remaining plan available to provide stock-based incentive compensation to our employees, directors and other eligible
  persons. Awards previously granted under the 2006 Omnibus Incentive Plan remain outstanding, while shares not yet granted
  under the plan are not available for future issuance.

  We account for our stock-based compensation plans in accordance with the provisions of FASB ASC 718, Stock Compensation,
  which requires that a company measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments
  based on the grant-date fair value of the award. The service period is the period of time that the grantee must provide services to
  us before the stock-based compensation is fully vested. The grant-date fair value of the award is recognized as an expense on a
  straight-line basis over the requisite service periods in our consolidated statements of operations. Forfeitures are estimated at the
  time of grant based on historical trends in order to estimate the amount of share-based awards that will ultimately vest. We
  monitor actual forfeitures for any subsequent adjustment to forfeiture rates.

  Restricted Stock and Performance Share Grants

  We currently grant shares of restricted stock to eligible employees and our independent directors and performance-based stock to
  eligible employees. We grant eligible employees two types of restricted stock (standard restricted shares and long-term retention
  restricted shares). Standard restricted shares granted to employees become fully vested no earlier than three years after the date of
  grant. Long-term retention restricted shares granted to selected executives vest at a 25% rate on or within approximately two
  months of an executive reaching the ages of 60 and 63, and become fully vested on or within approximately two months of an
  executive reaching the age of 65. Restricted shares granted to directors become fully vested upon the first anniversary of the date
  of grant.

  Performance-based shares issued to eligible employees are subject to a three-year measuring period and the achievement of
  performance targets and, depending upon the achievement of such performance targets, they may become vested no earlier than
  three years after the date of grant. Each period we evaluate the probability of achieving the applicable targets, and we adjust our
  accrual accordingly. Restricted shares (other than long-term retention restricted shares) and performance shares issued to certain
  key executives and directors are subject to a one or two year holding period upon the lapse of the vesting period. Forfeitures on
  stock grants are estimated at 5% for employees and 0% for executives and directors based upon our evaluation of historical and
  expected future turnover.


                                                                    78

                              NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

  Prior to the time a restricted share becomes fully vested or a performance share is issued, the awardees cannot transfer, pledge,
  hypothecate or encumber such shares. Prior to the time a restricted share is fully vested, the awardees have all other rights of a
  stockholder, including the right to vote (but do not receive dividends during the vesting period). Prior to the time a performance
  share is issued, the awardees shall have no rights as a stockholder. All shares and rights are subject to forfeiture if certain
  employment conditions are not met.

  Under the amended and restated 2016 Omnibus Incentive Plan, 2,050,000 shares are authorized to be issued. At December 31,
  2022, under the plan, there were an aggregate of (a) 1,385,337 shares of restricted and performance-based stock grants issued, net
  of forfeitures, and (b) 664,663 shares of common stock available for future grants. For the year ended December 31, 2022,
  246,325 restricted and performance-based shares were granted (179,825 restricted shares and 66,500 performance-based shares).

  In determining the grant date fair value, the stock price on the date of grant, as quoted on the New York Stock Exchange, was
  reduced by the present value of dividends expected to be paid on the shares issued and outstanding during the requisite service
  period, discounted at a risk-free interest rate. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury rates at the date of grant with
  maturity dates approximately equal to the restriction or vesting period at the grant date. In addition, a further discount for the lack
  of marketability reduced the fair value of grants issued to certain key executives and directors subject to the one or two year post
  vesting holding period. Assumptions used in calculating the discount for the lack of marketability include an estimate of stock
  volatility, risk-free interest rate, and a dividend yield.

  As related to restricted and performance stock shares, we recorded compensation expense of $7.6 million ($5.7 million, net of tax),
  $9.1 million ($6.9 million, net of tax) and $7.8 million ($5.8 million, net of tax), for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and
  2020, respectively. The unamortized compensation expense related to our restricted and performance-based shares was $14.9
  million and $16.6 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively and is expected to be recognized over a weighted average
  period of 4.3 years and 0.3 years for employees and directors, respectively, as of December 31, 2022 and over a weighted average
  period of 4.7 years and 0.4 years for employees and directors, respectively, as of December 31, 2021.

  Our restricted and performance-based share activity was as follows for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021:

  plans in March of the following year, are as follows (in thousands):

  We maintain a defined contribution Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan for key employees. Under the plan, these employees
  may elect to defer a portion of their compensation and, in addition, we may at our discretion make contributions to the plan on
  behalf of the employees. In March 2022 and 2021, contributions of $0.8 million and $0.5 million were made related to calendar
  year 2021 and 2020, respectively. As of December 31, 2022, we have recorded an obligation of $0.8 million for 2022.

  We also have an Employee Stock Ownership Plan and Trust (“ESOP”) for employees who are not covered by a collective
  bargaining agreement. In connection therewith, we maintain an employee benefits trust to which we contribute shares of treasury
  stock. We are authorized to instruct the trustees to distribute such shares toward the satisfaction of our future obligations under the
  plan. The shares held in trust are not considered outstanding for purposes of calculating earnings per share until they are committed
  to be released. The trustees will vote the shares in accordance with its fiduciary duties. During 2022, we contributed to the trust an
  additional 48,200 shares from our treasury and released 48,200 shares from the trust leaving 200 shares remaining in the trust as of
  December 31, 2022. The provision for expense in connection with the ESOP was approximately $2.3 million in 2022, $2.5 million
  in 2021 and $2.3 million in 2020.

  Defined Benefit Pension Plan

  We maintain a defined benefit unfunded Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (“SERP”). The SERP, as amended, is a defined
  benefit plan pursuant to which we will pay supplemental pension benefits to certain key employees upon the attainment of a
  contractual participant’s payment date based upon the employees’ years of service and compensation. As there are no current
  participants in the SERP, there was no benefit obligation outstanding related to the plan as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 and we
  recorded no expense related to the plan during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020.

  Postretirement Medical Benefits

  We provide certain medical and dental care benefits to 13 former U.S. union employees. The postretirement medical and dental
  benefit obligation for the former union employees as of December 31, 2022, and the net periodic benefit cost for our
  postretirement benefit plans for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 were not material.

  17. Derivative Financial Instruments

  Interest Rate Swap Agreements

  We occasionally use derivative financial instruments to reduce our market risk for changes in interest rates on our variable rate
  borrowings. The principal financial instruments used for cash flow hedging purposes are interest rate swap agreements. The
  interest rate swaps effectively convert a portion of our variable rate borrowings under our existing facilities to a fixed rate based
  upon determined notional amount. We do not enter into interest rate swap agreements, or other financial instruments, for trading or
  speculative purposes.

  In June 2022, we entered into a seven year interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of $100 million that is to mature in
  May 2029. The interest rate swap agreement has been designated as a cash flow hedge of interest payments on $100 million of
  borrowings under our Credit Agreement. Under the terms of the swap agreement, we will receive monthly variable interest
  payments based on one month Term SOFR and will pay interest based upon a fixed rate of 2.683% per annum, adjusted upward for
  the credit spread adjustment in the Credit Agreement of 0.10% and the loan margin in the Credit Agreement of 1.50% at December
  31, 2022.

  The fair value of the interest rate swap agreement as of December 31, 2022 was an asset of $5.2 million, which has been deferred
  and recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income, net of income taxes, in our consolidated balance sheet. When the
  interest expense on the underlying borrowing is recognized, the deferred gain/loss in accumulated other comprehensive income is
  recorded in earnings as interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations. We perform quarterly hedge effectiveness
  assessments and anticipate that the interest rate swap will be highly effective throughout its term.

  18. Fair Value Measurements

  We follow a three-level fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to measure fair value. This hierarchy requires entities to
  maximize the use of “observable inputs” and minimize the use of “unobservable inputs.” The three levels of inputs used to
  measure fair value are as follows:
          Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets as of the measurement date.
          Level 2: Significant other observable inputs other than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities;
          quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market
          data.
          Level 3: Significant unobservable inputs that reflect assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or
          liability.

  The following is a summary of the estimated fair values, carrying amounts, and classification under the fair value hierarchy of our
  financial instruments at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 (in thousands):

  The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents approximates fair value due to the short maturity of those investments. The fair
  value of the underlying assets held by the deferred compensation plan are based on the quoted market prices of the underlying
  funds which are held by registered investment companies. The carrying value of our variable rate short-term borrowings and long-
  term debt under our credit facilities approximates fair value as the variable interest rates in the facilities reflect current market
  rates. The fair value of our cash flow interest rate swap agreement obtained from two independent third parties, is based upon
  market quotes, and represents the net amount required to terminate the interest rate swap, taking into consideration market rates
  and counterparty credit risk.

  In assessing the realizability of the deferred tax assets, we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or the
  entire deferred tax asset will be realized. Ultimately, the realization of the deferred tax asset is dependent upon the generation of
  sufficient taxable income in those periods in which temporary differences become deductible and/or net operating loss
  carryforwards can be utilized. We consider the level of historical taxable income, scheduled reversal of temporary differences,
  carryback and carryforward periods, tax planning strategies and projected future taxable income in determining whether a
  valuation allowance is warranted. We also consider cumulative losses in recent years as well as the impact of one-time events in
  assessing our pre-tax earnings. Assumptions regarding future taxable income require significant judgment. Our assumptions are
  consistent with estimates and plans used to manage our business.

  The valuation allowance of $3.2 million as of December 31, 2022 is intended to provide for uncertainty regarding the ultimate
  realization of our U.S. foreign tax credit carryovers and foreign net operating loss carryovers. Based on these considerations, we
  believe it is more likely than not that we would realize the benefit of the net deferred tax asset of $33.7 million as of December 31,
  2022, which is net of the remaining valuation allowance. At December 31, 2022, we have foreign tax credit carryforwards of
  approximately $3 million that will expire in varying amounts by 2031.

  As related to the taxation of our foreign subsidiaries, we aggregate our foreign earnings and profits, and utilize allowable
  deductions and available foreign tax credits in computing our U.S. tax. Notwithstanding the U.S. taxation of these amounts, we
  intend to continue to invest most, or all, of these earnings indefinitely outside of the U.S., and do not expect to incur any
  significant additional taxes related to such amounts.

  In accordance with generally accepted accounting practices, we recognize in our financial statements only those tax positions that
  meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold. We establish tax reserves for uncertain tax positions that do not meet this
  threshold. During the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, we did not establish a liability for uncertain tax positions.

  We are subject to taxation in the U.S. and various state, local and foreign jurisdictions. As of December 31, 2022, the Company is
  no longer subject to U.S. Federal tax examinations for years before 2019. We remain subject to examination by state and local tax
  authorities for tax years 2018 through 2021. Foreign jurisdictions have statutes of limitations generally ranging from 2 to 6 years.
  Years still open to examination by foreign tax authorities in major jurisdictions include Canada (2018 onward), Hong Kong (2017
  onward), China (2020 onward), Mexico (2018 onward), Poland (2017 onward), Hungary (2016 onward) and Germany (2019
  onward). We do not presently anticipate that our unrecognized tax benefits will significantly increase or decrease over the next 12
  months; however, actual developments in this area could differ from those currently expected.

  20. Earnings Per Share

  We present two calculations of earnings per common share. “Basic” earnings per common share equals net earnings attributable to
  SMP divided by weighted average common shares outstanding during the period. “Diluted” earnings per common share equals net
  earnings attributable to SMP divided by the sum of weighted average common shares outstanding during the period plus
  potentially dilutive common shares. Potentially dilutive common shares that are anti-dilutive are excluded from net earnings per
  common share.

  Our three largest individual customers accounted for approximately 59% of our consolidated net sales in 2022. During 2022,
  O’Reilly, AutoZone and NAPA accounted for 27%, 17% and 15% of our consolidated net sales, respectively. Net sales from each
  of the customers were reported in both our Engine Management and Temperature Control Segments. The loss of one or more of
  these customers or, a significant reduction in purchases of our products from any one of them could have a material adverse impact
  on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, any consolidation among our key customers may further
  increase our customer concentration risk.

  For the disaggregation of our net sales from customers by geographic area, major product group and major sales channels for each
  of our segments, see Note 22, “Net Sales.”

  Beginning in the first quarter of 2023, our business will be organized into three operating segments – Engineered Solutions, Vehicle
  Control and Temperature Control. This change in operating segments will better align our operating segments with our strategic
  focus on diversification, and provide greater transparency into how we are positioned to capture growth opportunities of the
  future. The change will also better reflect the impact of our recent acquisitions.

  Disaggregation of Net Sales

  We disaggregate our net sales from customers by geographic area, major product group, and major sales channels for each of our
  segments, as we believe it best depicts how the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of our net sales are affected by economic
  factors.

  million and $17.5 million, respectively, for estimated product warranty claims included in accrued customer returns. The accrued
  product warranty costs are based primarily on historical experience of actual warranty claims. Warranty expense for each of the
  years 2022, 2021 and 2020 were $112.5 million, $91.9 million and $87.1 million, respectively.

  Letters of Credit

  At December 31, 2022, we had outstanding letters of credit with certain vendors aggregating approximately $2.4 million. These
  letters of credit are being maintained as security for reimbursements to insurance companies and as security to the landlord of our
  administrative offices in Long Island City, New York. The contract amount of the letters of credit is a reasonable estimate of their
  value as the value for each is fixed over the life of the commitment.

  Change of Control Arrangements

  We have a change in control arrangement with one key officer. In the event of a change of control (as defined in the agreement),
  the executive will receive severance payments and certain other benefits as provided in his agreement.

  Asbestos

  In 1986, we acquired a brake business, which we subsequently sold in March 1998 and which is accounted for as a discontinued
  operation in the accompanying statement of operations. When we originally acquired this brake business, we assumed future
  liabilities relating to any alleged exposure to asbestos-containing products manufactured by the seller of the acquired brake
  business. In accordance with the related purchase agreement, we agreed to assume the liabilities for all new claims filed on or after
  September 2001. Our ultimate exposure will depend upon the number of claims filed against us on or after September 2001, and
  the amounts paid for settlements, awards of asbestos-related damages, and defense of such claims. At December 31, 2022,
  approximately 1,530 cases were outstanding for which we may be responsible for any related liabilities. Since inception in
  September 2001 through December 31, 2022, the amounts paid for settled claims and awards of asbestos-related damages,
  including interest, were approximately $64.6 million. We do not have insurance coverage for the indemnity and defense costs
  associated with the claims we face.

  In evaluating our potential asbestos-related liability, we have considered various factors including, among other things, an actuarial
  study of the asbestos related liabilities performed by an independent actuarial firm, our settlement amounts and whether there are
  any co-defendants, the jurisdiction in which lawsuits are filed, and the status and results of such claims. As is our accounting
  policy, we consider the advice of actuarial consultants with experience in assessing asbestos-related liabilities to estimate our
  potential claim liability; and perform an actuarial evaluation in the third quarter of each year and whenever events or changes in
  circumstances indicate that additional provisions may be necessary. The methodology used to project asbestos-related liabilities
  and costs in our actuarial study considered: (1) historical data available from publicly available studies; (2) an analysis of our
  recent claims history to estimate likely filing rates into the future; (3) an analysis of our currently pending claims; (4) an analysis
  of our settlements and awards of asbestos-related damages to date; and (5) an analysis of closed claims with pay ratios and lag
  patterns in order to develop average future settlement values. Based on the information contained in the actuarial study and all
  other available information considered by us, we have concluded that no amount within the range of settlement payments and
  awards of asbestos-related damages was more likely than any other and, therefore, in assessing our asbestos liability we compare
  the low end of the range to our recorded liability to determine if an adjustment is required.

                                                                    90

  In accordance with our policy to perform an annual actuarial evaluation in the third quarter of each year, an actuarial study was
  performed as of August 31, 2022. The results of the August 31, 2022 study included an estimate of our undiscounted liability for
  settlement payments and awards of asbestos-related damages, excluding legal costs, ranging from $68.8 million to $111.6 million
  for the period through 2065. The change from the prior year study, which was as of August 31, 2021, was a $7.9 million increase
  for the low end of the range and a $11.4 million increase for the high end of the range. The increase in the estimated undiscounted
  liability from the prior year study at both the low end and high end of the range reflects our actual experience, our historical data
  and certain assumptions with respect to events that may occur in the future.

  Based upon the results of the August 31, 2022 actuarial study, in September 2022 we increased our asbestos liability to $68.8
  million, the low end of the range, and recorded an incremental pre-tax provision of $18.5 million in earnings (loss) from
  discontinued operations in the accompanying statement of operations. Future legal costs, which are expensed as incurred and
  reported in earnings (loss) from discontinued operations in the accompanying statement of operations, are estimated, according to
  the August 31, 2022 study, to range from $53.2 million to $105.7 million for the period through 2065. Total operating cash
  outflows related to discontinued operations, which include settlements, awards of asbestos-related damages and legal costs, net of
  taxes, were $12 million, $8.8 million and $16.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

  We plan to perform an annual actuarial evaluation during the third quarter of each year for the foreseeable future and whenever
  events or changes in circumstances indicate that additional provisions may be necessary. Given the uncertainties associated with
  projecting such matters into the future and other factors outside our control, we can give no assurance that additional provisions
  will not be required. We will continue to monitor events and changes in circumstances surrounding these potential liabilities in
  determining whether to perform additional actuarial evaluations and whether additional provisions may be necessary. At the
  present time, however, we do not believe that any additional provisions would be reasonably likely to have a material adverse
  effect on our liquidity or consolidated financial position.

  Other Litigation

  We are currently involved in various other legal claims and legal proceedings (some of which may involve substantial amounts),
  including claims related to commercial disputes, product liability, employment, and environmental. Although these legal claims
  and legal proceedings are subject to inherent uncertainties, based on our understanding and evaluation of the relevant facts and
  circumstances, we believe that the ultimate outcome of these matters will not, either individually or in the aggregate, have a
  material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. We may at any time determine that settling
  any of these matters is in our best interests, which settlement may include substantial payments. Although we cannot currently
  predict the specific amount of any liability that may ultimately arise with respect to any of these matters, we will record provisions
  when the liability is considered probable and reasonably estimable. Significant judgment is required in both the determination of
  probability and the determination as to whether an exposure can be reasonably estimated. As additional information becomes
  available, we reassess our potential liability related to these matters. Such revisions of the potential liabilities could have a material
  adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.


                                                                      91

  styling and the safety of our users and workforce in the design and manufacture of our products and are continuing to develop full
  self-driving technology for improved safety. We also strive to lower the cost of ownership for our customers through continuous
  efforts to reduce manufacturing costs and by offering financial and other services tailored to our products.

       Our mission is to accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy. We believe that this mission, along with our
  engineering expertise, vertically integrated business model and focus on user experience differentiate us from other companies.

  Segment Information
        We operate as two reportable segments: (i) automotive and (ii) energy generation and storage.

        The automotive segment includes the design, development, manufacturing, sales and leasing of high-performance fully electric
  vehicles as well as sales of automotive regulatory credits. Additionally, the automotive segment also includes services and other,
  which includes non-warranty after-sales vehicle services and parts, sales of used vehicles, retail merchandise, paid Supercharging
  and vehicle insurance revenue. The energy generation and storage segment includes the design, manufacture, installation, sales and
  leasing of solar energy generation and energy storage products and related services and sales of solar energy systems incentives.

  Our Products and Services
  Automotive
         We currently manufacture four different consumer vehicles – the Model 3, Y, S and X. Model 3 is a four-door mid-size sedan
  that we designed for manufacturability with a base price for mass-market appeal. Model Y is a compact sport utility vehicle (“SUV”)
  built on the Model 3 platform with seating for up to seven adults. Model S is a four-door full-size sedan and Model X is a mid-size
  SUV with seating for up to seven adults. Model S and Model X feature the highest performance characteristics and longest ranges
  that we offer in a sedan and SUV, respectively.

        In December 2022, we began early production and deliveries of the Tesla Semi, our first commercial electric vehicle. We have
  also announced several planned electric vehicles to address additional vehicle markets, including specialized consumer electric
  vehicles in Cybertruck and the new Tesla Roadster. We plan to continue leveraging developments in our proprietary Full Self-
  Driving (“FSD”), battery cell and other technologies.

  Energy Generation and Storage
        Energy Storage Products
       Powerwall and Megapack are our lithium-ion battery energy storage products. Powerwall is designed to store energy at a home
  or small commercial facility. Megapack is an energy storage solution for commercial, industrial, utility and energy generation
  customers, multiple of which may be grouped together to form larger installations of gigawatt hours (“GWh”) or greater capacity.

        We also continue to develop software capabilities for remotely controlling and dispatching our energy storage systems across a
  wide range of markets and applications, including through our real-time energy control and optimization platforms.

        Solar Energy Offerings
        We sell retrofit solar energy systems to customers and channel partners and also make them available through power purchase
  agreement (“PPA”) arrangements. We purchase most of the components for our retrofit solar energy systems from multiple sources
  to ensure competitive pricing and adequate supply. We also design and manufacture certain components for our solar energy
  products.

         We sell our Solar Roof, which combines premium glass roof tiles with energy generation, directly to customers, as well as
  through channel customers. We continue to improve our installation capability and efficiency, including through collaboration with
  real estate developers and builders on new homes.
                                                                  4

25/04/23, 17:14                                                               10-K




  Technology
  Automotive
        Battery and Powertrain
        Our core vehicle technology competencies include powertrain engineering and manufacturing and our ability to design
  vehicles that utilize the unique advantages of an electric powertrain. We have designed our proprietary powertrain systems to be
  adaptable, efficient, reliable and cost-effective while withstanding the rigors of an automotive environment. We offer dual motor
  powertrain vehicles, which use two electric motors to maximize traction and performance in an all-wheel drive configuration, as
  well as vehicle powertrain technology featuring three electric motors for further increased performance in certain versions of Model
  S and Model X and the Tesla Semi.

       We maintain extensive testing and R&D capabilities for battery cells, packs and systems, and have built an expansive body of
  knowledge on lithium-ion cell chemistry types and performance characteristics. In order to enable a greater supply of cells for our
  products with higher energy density at lower costs, we have developed a new proprietary lithium-ion battery cell and improved
  manufacturing processes.

        Vehicle Control and Infotainment Software
        The performance and safety systems of our vehicles and their battery packs utilize sophisticated control software. Control
  systems in our vehicles optimize performance, customize vehicle behavior, manage charging and control all infotainment functions.
  We develop almost all of this software, including most of the user interfaces, internally and update our vehicles’ software regularly
  through over-the-air updates.

        Self-Driving Development and Artificial Intelligence
        We have expertise in developing technologies, systems and software to enable self-driving vehicles using primarily vision-
  based technologies. Our FSD Computer runs our neural networks in our vehicles, and we are also developing additional computer
  hardware to better enable the massive amounts of field data captured by our vehicles to continually train and improve these neural
  networks for real-world performance.

        Currently, we offer in our vehicles certain advanced driver assist systems under our Autopilot and FSD options. Although at
  present the driver is ultimately responsible for controlling the vehicle, our systems provide safety and convenience functionality that
  relieves drivers of the most tedious and potentially dangerous aspects of road travel much like the system that airplane pilots use,
  when conditions permit. As with other vehicle systems, we improve these functions in our vehicles over time through over-the-air
  updates.

       We intend to establish in the future an autonomous Tesla ride-hailing network, which we expect would also allow us to access
  a new customer base even as modes of transportation evolve.

       We are also applying our artificial intelligence learnings from self-driving technology to the field of robotics. For example, in
  2022 we previewed Optimus, a robotic humanoid which is controlled by the same AI system.

  Energy Generation and Storage
        Energy Storage Products
        We leverage many of the component-level technologies from our vehicles in our energy storage products. By taking a modular
  approach to the design of battery systems, we can optimize manufacturing capacity of our energy storage products. Additionally, our
  expertise in power electronics enables our battery systems to interconnect with electricity grids while providing fast-acting systems
  for power injection and absorption. We have also developed software to remotely control and dispatch our energy storage systems.

        Solar Energy Systems
        We have engineered Solar Roof over numerous iterations to combine aesthetic appeal and durability with power generation.
  The efficiency of our solar energy products is aided by our own solar inverter, which incorporates our power electronics
  technologies. We designed both products to integrate with Powerwall.
                                                                    5

25/04/23, 17:14                                                                10-K




  Design and Engineering
  Automotive
        We have established significant in-house capabilities in the design and test engineering of electric vehicles and their
  components and systems. Our team has significant experience in computer-aided design as well as durability, strength and crash test
  simulations, which reduces the product development time of new models. We have also achieved complex engineering feats in
  stamping, casting and thermal systems, and developed a method to integrate batteries directly with vehicle body structures without
  separate battery packs to optimize manufacturability, weight, range and cost characteristics.

        We are also expanding our manufacturing operations globally while taking action to localize our vehicle designs and
  production for particular markets, including country-specific market demands and factory optimizations for local workforces. As we
  increase our capabilities, particularly in the areas of automation, die-making and line-building, we are also making strides in the
  simulations modeling these capabilities prior to construction.

  Energy Generation and Storage
        Our expertise in electrical, mechanical, civil and software engineering allows us to design, engineer, manufacture and install
  energy generating and storage products and components, including at the residential through utility scale. For example, the modular
  design of our Megapack utility-scale battery line is intended to significantly reduce the amount of assembly required in the field. We
  also customize solutions including our energy storage products, solar energy systems and/or Solar Roof for customers to meet their
  specific needs.

  Sales and Marketing
        Historically, we have been able to generate significant media coverage of our company and our products, and we believe we
  will continue to do so. Such media coverage and word of mouth are the current primary drivers of our sales leads and have helped us
  achieve sales without traditional advertising and at relatively low marketing costs.

  Automotive
        Direct Sales
        Our vehicle sales channels currently include our website and an international network of company-owned stores. In some
  jurisdictions, we also have galleries to educate and inform customers about our products, but such locations do not transact in the
  sale of vehicles. We believe this infrastructure enables us to better control costs of inventory, manage warranty service and pricing,
  educate consumers about electric vehicles, maintain and strengthen the Tesla brand and obtain rapid customer feedback.

        We reevaluate our sales strategy both globally and at a location-by-location level from time to time to optimize our sales
  channels. However, sales of vehicles in the automobile industry tend to be cyclical in many markets, which may expose us to
  volatility from time to time.

        Used Vehicle Sales
        Our used vehicle business supports new vehicle sales by integrating the trade-in of a customer’s existing Tesla or non-Tesla
  vehicle with the sale of a new or used Tesla vehicle. The Tesla and non-Tesla vehicles we acquire as trade-ins are subsequently
  remarketed, either directly by us or through third parties. We also remarket used Tesla vehicles acquired from other sources
  including lease returns.

        Public Charging
         We have a growing global network of Tesla Superchargers, which are our industrial-grade, high-speed vehicle chargers. Where
  possible, we co-locate Superchargers with our solar and energy storage systems to reduce costs and promote renewable power.
  Supercharger stations are typically placed along well-traveled routes and in and around dense city centers to allow vehicle owners
  the ability to enjoy quick, reliable charging along an extensive network with convenient stops. Use of the Supercharger network
  either requires payment of a fee or is free under certain sales programs. In November 2021, we began to offer Supercharger access to
  non-Tesla vehicles in certain locations in support of our mission to accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy.

         We also work with a wide variety of hospitality, retail and public destinations, as well as businesses with commuting
  employees, to offer additional charging options for our customers, as well as single-family homeowners and multi-family residential
  entities, to deploy home charging solutions.
                                                                      6

        In-App Upgrades
        As our vehicles are capable of being updated remotely over-the-air, our customers may purchase additional paid options and
  features through the Tesla app or through the in-vehicle user interface. We expect that this functionality will also allow us to offer
  certain options and features on a subscription basis in the future.

  Energy Generation and Storage
        We market and sell our solar and energy storage products to residential, commercial and industrial customers and utilities
  through a variety of channels, including through our website, stores and galleries, as well as through our network of channel
  partners, and in the case of some commercial customers, through PPA transactions. We emphasize simplicity, standardization and
  accessibility to make it easy and cost-effective for customers to adopt clean energy, while reducing our customer acquisition costs.

  Service and Warranty
  Automotive
        Service
        We provide service for our electric vehicles at our company-owned service locations and through Tesla Mobile Service
  technicians who perform work remotely at customers’ homes or other locations. Performing vehicle service ourselves allows us to
  identify problems and implement solutions and improvements faster, and optimize logistics and inventory better, than traditional
  automobile manufacturers and their dealer networks. The connectivity of our vehicles also allows us to diagnose and remedy many
  problems remotely and proactively.

        Vehicle Limited Warranties and Extended Service Plans
        We provide a manufacturer’s limited warranty on all new and used Tesla vehicles we sell, which may include separate limited
  warranties on certain components, specific types of damage or battery capacity retention. We also currently offer extended service
  plans that provide coverage beyond the new vehicle limited warranties for certain models in specified regions.

  Energy Generation and Storage
        We provide service and repairs to our energy product customers, including under warranty where applicable. We generally
  provide manufacturer’s limited warranties with our energy storage products and offer certain extended limited warranties that are
  available at the time of purchase of the system. If we install a system, we also provide certain limited warranties on our installation
  workmanship.

        For retrofit solar energy systems, we provide separate limited warranties for workmanship and against roof leaks, and for Solar
  Roof, we also provide limited warranties for defects and weatherization. For components not manufactured by us, we generally pass-
  through the applicable manufacturers’ warranties.

         As part of our solar energy system and energy storage contracts, we may provide the customer with performance guarantees
  that commit that the underlying system will meet or exceed the minimum energy generation or performance requirements specified
  in the contract.

  Financial Services
  Automotive
        Purchase Financing and Leases
        We offer leasing and/or loan financing arrangements for our vehicles in certain jurisdictions in North America, Europe and
  Asia ourselves and through various financial institutions. Under certain of such programs, we have provided resale value guarantees
  or buyback guarantees that may obligate us to repurchase the subject vehicles at pre-determined values.

        Insurance
         In 2021, we launched our insurance product using real-time driving behavior in select states, which offers rates that are often
  better than other alternatives and promotes safer driving. Our insurance products are currently available in 12 states and we plan to
  expand the markets in which we offer insurance products, as part of our ongoing effort to decrease the total cost of ownership for our
  customers.
                                                                     7

  Energy Generation and Storage
        We offer certain financing options to our solar customers, which enable the customer to purchase and own a solar energy
  system, Solar Roof or integrated solar and Powerwall system. Our solar PPAs, offered primarily to commercial customers, charge a
  fee per kilowatt-hour based on the amount of electricity produced by our solar energy systems.

  Manufacturing
       We currently have manufacturing facilities in the US in Northern California, in Buffalo, New York, Gigafactory New York; in
  Austin, Texas, Gigafactory Texas and near Reno, Nevada, Gigafactory Nevada. At these facilities, we manufacture and assemble,
  among other things, vehicles, certain vehicle parts and components, such as our battery packs and battery cells, energy storage
  components and solar products and components.

        Internationally, we also have manufacturing facilities in China (Gigafactory Shanghai) and Germany (Gigafactory Berlin-
  Brandenburg), which allows us to increase the affordability of our vehicles for customers in local markets by reducing transportation
  and manufacturing costs and eliminating the impact of unfavorable tariffs. Generally, we continue to expand production capacity at
  our existing facilities. We also intend to further increase cost-competitiveness in our significant markets by strategically adding local
  manufacturing.

  Supply Chain
         Our products use thousands of parts that are sourced from hundreds of suppliers across the world. We have developed close
  relationships with vendors of key parts such as battery cells, electronics and complex vehicle assemblies. Certain components
  purchased from these suppliers are shared or are similar across many product lines, allowing us to take advantage of pricing
  efficiencies from economies of scale.

        As is the case for some automotive companies, some of our procured components and systems are sourced from single
  suppliers. Where multiple sources are available for certain key components, we work to qualify multiple suppliers for them where it
  is sensible to do so in order to minimize potential production risks due to disruptions in their supply. We also mitigate risk by
  maintaining safety stock for key parts and assemblies and die banks for components with lengthy procurement lead times.

        Our products use various raw materials including aluminum, steel, cobalt, lithium, nickel and copper. Pricing for these
  materials is governed by market conditions and may fluctuate due to various factors outside of our control, such as supply and
  demand and market speculation. We strive to execute long-term supply contracts for such materials at competitive pricing when
  feasible, and we currently believe that we have adequate access to raw materials supplies to meet the needs of our operations.

  Governmental Programs, Incentives and Regulations
       Globally, the ownership of our products by our customers is impacted by various government credits, incentives, and policies.
  Our business and products are also subject to numerous governmental regulations that vary among jurisdictions.

        The operation of our business is also impacted by various government programs, incentives, and other arrangements. See Note
  2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on
  Form 10-K for further details.

  Programs and Incentives
        Inflation Reduction Act
         On August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (“IRA”) was enacted into law and is effective for taxable years
  beginning after December 31, 2022, and remains subject to future guidance releases. The IRA includes multiple incentives to
  promote clean energy, electric vehicles, battery and energy storage manufacture or purchase, including through providing tax credits
  to consumers. For example, qualifying Tesla customers may receive up to $7,500 in federal tax credits for the purchase of qualified
  electric vehicles in the U.S through 2032.

        Automotive Regulatory Credits
       We earn tradable credits in the operation of our business under various regulations related to zero-emission vehicles (“ZEVs”),
  greenhouse gas, fuel economy and clean fuel. We sell these credits to other regulated entities who can use the credits to comply with
  emission standards and other regulatory requirements. Sales of these credits are recognized within automotive regulatory credits
  revenue in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
                                                                    8

        Energy Storage System Incentives and Policies
        While the regulatory regime for energy storage projects is still under development, there are various policies, incentives and
  financial mechanisms at the federal, state and local levels that support the adoption of energy storage.

        For example, energy storage systems that are charged using solar energy may be eligible for the solar energy-related U.S.
  federal tax credits described below. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”) has also taken steps to enable the
  participation of energy storage in wholesale energy markets. In addition, California and a number of other states have adopted
  procurement targets for energy storage, and behind-the-meter energy storage systems qualify for funding under the California Self
  Generation Incentive Program. Our customers primarily benefit directly under these programs. In certain instances our customers
  may transfer such credits to us as contract consideration. In such transactions, they are included as a component of energy generation
  and storage revenues in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

        Pursuant to the IRA, under Sections 48, 48E and 25D of the Internal Revenue Code (”IRC”), standalone energy storage
  technology is eligible for a tax credit between 6% and 50% of qualified expenditures, regardless of the source of energy, which may
  be claimed by our customers for storage systems they purchase or by us for arrangements where we own the systems. These tax
  credits are primarily for the benefit of our customers and are currently scheduled to phase-out starting in 2032 or later.

        Solar Energy System Incentives and Policies
        U.S. federal, state and local governments have established various policies, incentives and financial mechanisms to reduce the
  cost of solar energy and to accelerate the adoption of solar energy. These incentives include tax credits, cash grants, tax abatements
  and rebates.

        In particular, pursuant to the IRA, Sections 48, 48E and 25D of the IRC provides a tax credit between 6% and 70% of
  qualified commercial or residential expenditures for solar energy systems, which may be claimed by our customers for systems they
  purchase, or by us for arrangements where we own the systems for properties that meet statutory requirements. These tax credits are
  primarily for the direct benefit of our customers and are currently scheduled to phase-out starting in 2023 or later.

  Regulations
        Vehicle Safety and Testing
        In the U.S., our vehicles are subject to regulation by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (“NHTSA”),
  including all applicable Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (“FMVSS”) and the NHTSA bumper standard. Numerous FMVSS
  apply to our vehicles, such as crash-worthiness and occupant protection requirements. Our current vehicles fully comply and we
  expect that our vehicles in the future will fully comply with all applicable FMVSS with limited or no exemptions, however, FMVSS
  are subject to change from time to time. As a manufacturer, we must self-certify that our vehicles meet all applicable FMVSS and
  the NHTSA bumper standard, or otherwise are exempt, before the vehicles may be imported or sold in the U.S.

        We are also required to comply with other federal laws administered by NHTSA, including the Corporate Average Fuel
  Economy standards, Theft Prevention Act requirements, labeling requirements and other information provided to customers in
  writing, Early Warning Reporting requirements regarding warranty claims, field reports, death and injury reports and foreign recalls,
  a Standing General Order requiring reports regarding crashes involving vehicles equipped with advanced driver assistance systems,
  and additional requirements for cooperating with compliance and safety investigations and recall reporting. The U.S. Automobile
  Information and Disclosure Act also requires manufacturers of motor vehicles to disclose certain information regarding the
  manufacturer’s suggested retail price, optional equipment and pricing. In addition, federal law requires inclusion of fuel economy
  ratings, as determined by the U.S. Department of Transportation and the Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”), and New
  Car Assessment Program ratings as determined by NHTSA, if available.

        Our vehicles sold outside of the U.S. are subject to similar foreign compliance, safety, environmental and other regulations.
  Many of those regulations are different from those applicable in the U.S. and may require redesign and/or retesting. Some of those
  regulations impact or prevent the rollout of new vehicle features. Additionally, the European Union established new rules regarding
  additional compliance oversight that commenced in 2020.

        Self-Driving Vehicles
        Generally, laws pertaining to self-driving vehicles are evolving globally, and in some cases may create restrictions on features
  that we develop. While there are currently no federal U.S. regulations pertaining specifically to self-driving vehicles or self-driving
  equipment, NHTSA has published recommended guidelines on self-driving vehicles, apart from the FMVSS and manufacturer
  reporting obligations, and retains the authority to investigate and/or take action on the safety or compliance of any vehicle,
  equipment or features operating on public roads. Certain U.S. states also have legal restrictions on the operation, registration or
  licensure of self-driving vehicles, and many other states are considering them. This regulatory patchwork increases the legal
  complexity with respect to self-driving vehicles in the U.S.
                                                                      9

25/04/23, 17:14                                                                 10-K



        In markets that follow the regulations of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe, some requirements restrict the
  design of advanced driver-assistance or self-driving features, which can compromise or prevent their use entirely. Other applicable
  laws, both current and proposed, may hinder the path and timeline to introducing self-driving vehicles for sale and use in the markets
  where they apply.

       Other key markets, including China, continue to consider self-driving regulation. Any implemented regulations may differ
  materially from those in the U.S. and Europe, which may further increase the legal complexity of self-driving vehicles and limit or
  prevent certain features.

        Automobile Manufacturer and Dealer Regulation
        In the U.S., state laws regulate the manufacture, distribution, sale and service of automobiles, and generally require motor
  vehicle manufacturers and dealers to be licensed in order to sell vehicles directly to residents. Certain states have asserted that the
  laws in such states do not permit automobile manufacturers to be licensed as dealers or to act in the capacity of a dealer, or that they
  otherwise restrict a manufacturer’s ability to deliver or perform warranty repairs on vehicles. To sell vehicles to residents of states
  where we are not licensed as a dealer, we generally conduct the sale out of the state. In certain such states, we have opened
  “galleries” that serve an educational purpose and where sales may not occur.

        Some automobile dealer trade associations have both challenged the legality of our operations in court and used administrative
  and legislative processes to attempt to prohibit or limit our ability to operate existing stores or expand to new locations. Certain
  dealer associations have also actively lobbied state licensing agencies and legislators to interpret existing laws or enact new laws in
  ways not favorable to our ownership and operation of our own retail and service locations. We expect such challenges to continue,
  and we intend to actively fight any such efforts.

        Battery Safety and Testing
         Our battery packs are subject to various U.S. and international regulations that govern transport of “dangerous goods,” defined
  to include lithium-ion batteries, which may present a risk in transportation. We conduct testing to demonstrate our compliance with
  such regulations.

        We use lithium-ion cells in our high voltage battery packs in our vehicles and energy storage products. The use, storage and
  disposal of our battery packs are regulated under existing laws and are the subject of ongoing regulatory changes that may add
  additional requirements in the future. We have agreements with third party battery recycling companies to recycle our battery packs,
  and we are also piloting our own recycling technology.

        Solar Energy—General
       We are subject to certain state and federal regulations applicable to solar and battery storage providers and sellers of electricity.
  To operate our systems, we enter into standard interconnection agreements with applicable utilities. Sales of electricity and non-sale
  equipment leases by third parties, such as our leases and PPAs, have faced regulatory challenges in some states and jurisdictions.

        Solar Energy—Net Metering
         Most states in the U.S. make net energy metering, or net metering, available to solar customers. Net metering typically allows
  solar customers to interconnect their solar energy systems to the utility grid and offset their utility electricity purchases by receiving
  a bill credit for excess energy generated by their solar energy system that is exported to the grid. In certain jurisdictions, regulators
  or utilities have reduced or eliminated the benefit available under net metering or have proposed to do so.

  Competition
  Automotive
        The worldwide automotive market is highly competitive and we expect it will become even more competitive in the future as
  we introduce additional vehicles in a broader cross-section of the passenger and commercial vehicle market and expand our vehicles’
  capabilities.
                                                                    10




https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000095017023001409/tsla-20221231.htm                                                     10/115
25/04/23, 17:14                                                                10-K



         We believe that our vehicles compete in the market based on both their traditional segment classification as well as their
  propulsion technology. For example, Model S and Model X compete primarily with premium sedans and premium SUVs and Model
  3 and Model Y compete with small to medium-sized sedans and compact SUVs, which are extremely competitive markets.
  Competing products typically include internal combustion vehicles from more established automobile manufacturers; however,
  many established and new automobile manufacturers have entered or have announced plans to enter the market for electric and other
  alternative fuel vehicles. Overall, we believe these announcements and vehicle introductions, including the introduction of electric
  vehicles into rental car company fleets, promote the development of the electric vehicle market by highlighting the attractiveness of
  electric vehicles relative to the internal combustion vehicle. Many major automobile manufacturers have electric vehicles available
  today in major markets including the U.S., China and Europe, and other current and prospective automobile manufacturers are also
  developing electric vehicles. In addition, several manufacturers offer hybrid vehicles, including plug-in versions.

        We believe that there is also increasing competition for our vehicle offerings as a platform for delivering self-driving
  technologies, charging solutions and other features and services, and we expect to compete in this developing market through
  continued progress on our Autopilot, FSD and neural network capabilities, Supercharger network and our infotainment offerings.

  Energy Generation and Storage
        Energy Storage Systems
        The market for energy storage products is also highly competitive, and both established and emerging companies have
  introduced products that are similar to our product portfolio or that are alternatives to the elements of our systems. We compete with
  these companies based on price, energy density and efficiency. We believe that the specifications and features of our products, our
  strong brand and the modular, scalable nature of our energy storage products give us a competitive advantage in our markets.

        Solar Energy Systems
        The primary competitors to our solar energy business are the traditional local utility companies that supply energy to our
  potential customers. We compete with these traditional utility companies primarily based on price and the ease by which customers
  can switch to electricity generated by our solar energy systems. We also compete with solar energy companies that provide products
  and services similar to ours. Many solar energy companies only install solar energy systems, while others only provide financing for
  these installations. We believe we have a significant expansion opportunity with our offerings and that the regulatory environment is
  increasingly conducive to the adoption of renewable energy systems.

  Intellectual Property
        We place a strong emphasis on our innovative approach and proprietary designs which bring intrinsic value and uniqueness to
  our product portfolio. As part of our business, we seek to protect the underlying intellectual property rights of these innovations and
  designs such as with respect to patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets and other measures, including through employee and
  third-party nondisclosure agreements and other contractual arrangements. For example, we place a high priority on obtaining patents
  to provide the broadest and strongest possible protection to enable our freedom to operate our innovations and designs within our
  products and technologies in the electric vehicle market as well as to protect and defend our product portfolio. We have also adopted
  a patent policy in which we irrevocably pledged that we will not initiate a lawsuit against any party for infringing our patents
  through activity relating to electric vehicles or related equipment for so long as such party is acting in good faith. We made this
  pledge in order to encourage the advancement of a common, rapidly-evolving platform for electric vehicles, thereby benefiting
  ourselves, other companies making electric vehicles and the world.

  Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) and Human Capital Resources
  ESG
         The very purpose of Tesla's existence is to accelerate the world's transition to sustainable energy. We believe the world cannot
  reduce carbon emissions without addressing both energy generation and consumption, and we are designing and manufacturing a
  complete energy and transportation ecosystem to achieve this goal. As we expand, we are building each new factory to be more
  efficient and sustainably designed than the previous one, including with respect to per-unit waste reduction and resource
  consumption, including water and energy usage. We are focused on further enhancing sustainability of operations outside of our
  direct control, including reducing the carbon footprint of our supply chain.
                                                                     11

25/04/23, 17:14                                                                10-K



        We are committed to sourcing only responsibly produced materials, and our suppliers are required to provide evidence of
  management systems that ensure social, environmental and sustainability best practices in their own operations, as well as to
  demonstrate a commitment to responsible sourcing into their supply chains. We have a zero-tolerance policy when it comes to child
  or forced labor and human trafficking by our suppliers and we look to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and
  Development Due Diligence Guidelines to inform our process and use feedback from our internal and external stakeholders to find
  ways to continually improve. We are also driving safety in our own factories by focusing on worker engagement. Our incidents per
  vehicle continue to drop even as our production volumes increase. We also strive to be an employer of choice by offering
  compelling, impactful jobs with best in-industry benefits.

         We believe that sound corporate governance is critical to helping us achieve our goals, including with respect to ESG. We
  continue to evolve a governance framework that exercises appropriate oversight of responsibilities at all levels throughout the
  company and manages its affairs consistent with high principles of business ethics. Our ESG Sustainability Council is made up of
  leaders from across our company, and regularly presents to our Board of Directors, which oversees our ESG impacts, initiatives and
  priorities.

  Human Capital Resources
        Our greatest asset is our people and we continue to attract the best and brightest with our competitive pay and benefits package
  which starts with ownership. We offer employees the opportunity to receive equity during their employment and share in the success
  of Tesla. As of December 31, 2022, our full-time count for our and our subsidiaries’ employees worldwide was 127,855, a 29,000
  year over year increase.

        We are committed to providing a workplace where our employees feel respected and appreciated. Human Resource (“HR”)
  Partners for each functional area are introduced in new hire orientation so employees know whom to contact with questions or
  concerns. HR Partners are visible throughout facilities and are actively involved in driving culture and engagement alongside
  business leaders.

         Our policies are designed to promote fairness and respect for everyone. We hire, evaluate, and promote employees based on
  their skills and performance. Everyone is expected to be trustworthy, demonstrate excellence in their performance, and collaborate
  with others. With this in mind, we will not tolerate certain behaviors. These include harassment, retaliation, violence, intimidation,
  and discrimination of any kind on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender
  expression, age, disability or veteran status.

        To ensure this, anti-harassment training is conducted on day one of new hire orientation for all employees. In addition, we run
  various leadership development programs throughout the year aimed at enhancing leaders’ skills, and in particular, helping them to
  understand how to appropriately respond to employee concerns.

        Through our See Something, Say Something program, employees are encouraged to speak up both in regard to misconduct and
  safety concerns. They can do so by contacting the integrity line, submitting concerns through our Take Charge process, or notifying
  their HR Partner or any member of management. Concerns are reviewed in accordance with established protocols by investigators
  with expertise, who also review for trends and outcomes for remediation and appropriate controls.

        Responding to questions timely is key so we implemented HR Answer Bars in the factories where employees can easily access
  and speak with an HR representative immediately regarding career advice, benefits or any concerns the employee may have. We
  have also implemented an HR Chatbot for 24x7 answers to team members’ questions.
                                                                12

       To continue innovating and changing the world for the better, we must ensure we have a talented and engaged workforce with
  ample opportunity to contribute to our mission and grow professionally. We are focused on intentionally creating pathways to career
  opportunities across Tesla through strategic initiatives such as:
        •         Internships and Apprenticeships - Over 3,000 university and community college students from around the world are
                  hired into internship and apprenticeship opportunities at Tesla annually. We recruit from over 100 collegiate institutions
                  and diverse student organizations, attracting top talent passionate about accelerating the world’s transition to sustainable
                  energy.
        •         Tesla START - Tesla START is an intensive training program providing individuals with the skills necessary for a
                  successful technician role at Tesla. We partner with 13 colleges across the country to integrate Tesla START into
                  automotive, collision and manufacturing curriculums to provide individuals with a smooth transition from college to
                  full-time employment. In 2022, we had over 200 graduates from Tesla START programs, with an additional 100+
                  graduating in the coming weeks from our winter classes.
        •         High School Graduate Pathways - Tesla's Manufacturing Development Program is designed to provide graduating
                  high school seniors with the financial resources, coursework and experience they need to start a successful
                  manufacturing career at Tesla. We hired 144 graduates through this program in 2022, and our goal in 2023 is to grow
                  this program 2.5X to over 360 students annually across our Fremont Factory, Gigafactory Nevada, Gigafactory Texas,
                  and Gigafactory New York.

        At Tesla, our employees show up passionate about making a difference in the world and for each other. With a majority-
  minority workforce, empowering our employee resource groups to take charge in driving initiatives that attract, develop and retain
  our passionate workforce is vital to our continued success.

  ITEM 1A.         RISK FACTORS
        You should carefully consider the risks described below together with the other information set forth in this report, which
  could materially affect our business, financial condition and future results. The risks described below are not the only risks facing
  our company. Risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially
  adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.

  Risks Related to Our Ability to Grow Our Business
        We may be impacted by macroeconomic conditions resulting from the global COVID-19 pandemic.
         Since the first quarter of 2020, there has been a worldwide impact from the COVID-19 pandemic. Government regulations and
  shifting social behaviors have, at times, limited or closed non-essential transportation, government functions, business activities and
  person-to-person interactions. Global trade conditions and consumer trends that originated during the pandemic continue to persist
  and may also have long-lasting adverse impact on us and our industries independently of the progress of the pandemic.

         For example, pandemic-related issues have exacerbated port congestion and intermittent supplier shutdowns and delays,
  resulting in additional expenses to expedite delivery of critical parts. Similarly, increased demand for personal electronics has
  created a shortfall of semiconductors, which has caused challenges in our supply chain and production. In addition, labor shortages
  resulting from the pandemic, including worker absenteeism, has led to increased difficulty in hiring and retaining manufacturing and
  service workers, as well as increased labor costs and supplier delays. Sustaining our production trajectory will require the ongoing
  readiness and solvency of our suppliers and vendors, a stable and motivated production workforce and government cooperation,
  including for travel and visa allowances. The contingencies inherent in the ramp at new facilities such as Gigafactory Berlin-
  Brandenburg and Gigafactory Texas may be exacerbated by these challenges. Additionally, infection rates and regulations continue
  to fluctuate in various regions, which may impact operations. For example, in 2022, spikes in COVID-19 cases in Shanghai resulted
  in the temporary shutdown of Gigafactory Shanghai, as well as parts of our supply chain, and impacted our ability to deliver cars.

        We cannot predict the duration or direction of current global trends or their sustained impact. Ultimately, we continue to
  monitor macroeconomic conditions to remain flexible and to optimize and evolve our business as appropriate, and attempt to
  accurately project demand and infrastructure requirements globally and deploy our production, workforce and other resources
  accordingly. Lastly, rising interest rates may lead to consumers to increasingly pull back spending, including on our products, which
  may harm our demand, business and operating results. If we experience unfavorable global market conditions, or if we cannot or do
  not maintain operations at a scope that is commensurate with such conditions or are later required to or choose to suspend such
  operations again, our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results may be harmed.

        We may experience delays in launching and ramping the production of our products and features, or we may be unable to
        control our manufacturing costs.
        We have previously experienced and may in the future experience launch and production ramp delays for new products and
  features. For example, we encountered unanticipated supplier issues that led to delays during the initial ramp of our first Model X
  and experienced challenges with a supplier and with ramping full automation for certain of our initial Model 3 manufacturing
  processes. In
                                                                  14




https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000095017023001409/tsla-20221231.htm                                                  14/115
25/04/23, 17:14                                                                10-K


  addition, we may introduce in the future new or unique manufacturing processes and design features for our products. There is no
  guarantee that we will be able to successfully and timely introduce and scale such processes or features.

         In particular, our future business depends in large part on increasing the production of mass-market vehicles including Model 3
  and Model Y. In order to be successful, we will need to implement, maintain and ramp efficient and cost-effective manufacturing
  capabilities, processes and supply chains and achieve the design tolerances, high quality and output rates we have planned at our
  manufacturing facilities in California, Nevada, Texas, China, Germany and any future sites. We will also need to hire, train and
  compensate skilled employees to operate these facilities. Bottlenecks and other unexpected challenges such as those we experienced
  in the past may arise during our production ramps, and we must address them promptly while continuing to improve manufacturing
  processes and reducing costs. If we are not successful in achieving these goals, we could face delays in establishing and/or
  sustaining our Model 3 and Model Y ramps or be unable to meet our related cost and profitability targets.

         We have experienced, and may also experience similar future delays in launching and/or ramping production of our energy
  storage products and Solar Roof; new product versions or variants; new vehicles; and future features and services based on artificial
  intelligence. Likewise, we may encounter delays with the design, construction and regulatory or other approvals necessary to build
  and bring online future manufacturing facilities and products.

        Any delay or other complication in ramping the production of our current products or the development, manufacture, launch
  and production ramp of our future products, features and services, or in doing so cost-effectively and with high quality, may harm
  our brand, business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.

        Our suppliers may fail to deliver components according to schedules, prices, quality and volumes that are acceptable to us,
        or we may be unable to manage these components effectively.
        Our products contain thousands of parts purchased globally from hundreds of suppliers, including single-source direct
  suppliers, which exposes us to multiple potential sources of component shortages. Unexpected changes in business conditions,
  materials pricing, including inflation of raw material costs, labor issues, wars, trade policies, natural disasters, health epidemics such
  as the global COVID-19 pandemic, trade and shipping disruptions, port congestions and other factors beyond our or our suppliers’
  control could also affect these suppliers’ ability to deliver components to us or to remain solvent and operational. For example, a
  global shortage of semiconductors has been reported since early 2021 and has caused challenges in the manufacturing industry and
  impacted our supply chain and production. In addition, a spike in COVID-19 cases in Shanghai in early 2022 led to temporary
  manufacturing shutdowns of certain of our suppliers. We have used alternative parts and programmed software to mitigate certain
  challenges caused by these shortages, but there is no guarantee we may be able to continually do so as we scale production to meet
  our growth targets. Additionally, if our suppliers do not accurately forecast and effectively allocate production or if they are not
  willing to allocate sufficient production to us, it may reduce our access to components and require us to search for new suppliers.
  The unavailability of any component or supplier could result in production delays, idle manufacturing facilities, product design
  changes and loss of access to important technology and tools for producing and supporting our products, as well as impact our
  capacity expansion and our ability to fulfill our obligations under customer contracts. Moreover, significant increases in our
  production, such as for Model 3 and Model Y, or product design changes by us have required and may in the future require us to
  procure additional components in a short amount of time. We have faced in the past, and may face suppliers who are unwilling or
  unable to sustainably meet our timelines or our cost, quality and volume needs, or to do so may cost us more, which may require us
  to replace them with other sources. Finally, we have limited vehicle manufacturing experience outside of the Fremont Factory and
  Gigafactory Shanghai and we may experience issues increasing the level of localized procurement at Gigafactory Berlin-
  Brandenburg and Gigafactory Texas. While we believe that we will be able to secure additional or alternate sources or develop our
  own replacements for most of our components, there is no assurance that we will be able to do so quickly or at all. Additionally, we
  may be unsuccessful in our continuous efforts to negotiate with existing suppliers to obtain cost reductions and avoid unfavorable
  changes to terms, source less expensive suppliers for certain parts and redesign certain parts to make them less expensive to produce,
  especially in light of the increases in materials pricing. Any of these occurrences may harm our business, prospects, financial
  condition and operating results.

       As the scale of our vehicle production increases, we will also need to accurately forecast, purchase, warehouse and transport
  components at high volumes to our manufacturing facilities and servicing locations internationally. If we are unable to accurately
  match the timing and quantities of component purchases to our actual needs or successfully implement automation, inventory
                                                                   15

  management and other systems to accommodate the increased complexity in our supply chain and parts management, we may incur
  unexpected production disruption, storage, transportation and write-off costs, which may harm our business and operating results.

        We may be unable to meet our projected construction timelines, costs and production ramps at new factories, or we may
        experience difficulties in generating and maintaining demand for products manufactured there.
        Our ability to increase production of our vehicles on a sustained basis, make them affordable globally by accessing local
  supply chains and workforces and streamline delivery logistics is dependent on the construction and ramp of our current and future
  factories. The construction of and commencement and ramp of production at these factories are subject to a number of uncertainties
  inherent in all new manufacturing operations, including ongoing compliance with regulatory requirements, procurement and
  maintenance of construction, environmental and operational licenses and approvals for additional expansion, supply chain
  constraints, hiring, training and retention of qualified employees and the pace of bringing production equipment and processes
  online with the capability to manufacture high-quality units at scale. Moreover, we will have to establish and ramp production of our
  proprietary battery cells and packs at our new factories, and we additionally intend to incorporate sequential design and
  manufacturing changes into vehicles manufactured at each new factory. If we experience any issues or delays in meeting our
  projected timelines, costs, capital efficiency and production capacity for our new factories, expanding and managing teams to
  implement iterative design and production changes there, maintaining and complying with the terms of any debt financing that we
  obtain to fund them or generating and maintaining demand for the vehicles we manufacture there, our business, prospects, operating
  results and financial condition may be harmed.

        We may be unable to grow our global product sales, delivery and installation capabilities and our servicing and vehicle
        charging networks, or we may be unable to accurately project and effectively manage our growth.
        Our success will depend on our ability to continue to expand our sales capabilities. We are targeting with Model 3 and Model
  Y a global mass demographic with a broad range of potential customers, in which we have relatively limited experience projecting
  demand and pricing our products. We currently produce numerous international variants at a limited number of factories, and if our
  specific demand expectations for these variants prove inaccurate, we may not be able to timely generate deliveries matched to the
  vehicles that we produce in the same timeframe or that are commensurate with the size of our operations in a given region. Likewise,
  as we develop and grow our energy products and services worldwide, our success will depend on our ability to correctly forecast
  demand in various markets.

        Because we do not have independent dealer networks, we are responsible for delivering all of our vehicles to our customers.
  As our production volumes continue to grow, we have faced in the past, and may face challenges with deliveries at increasing
  volumes, particularly in international markets requiring significant transit times. We have also deployed a number of delivery
  models, such as deliveries to customers’ homes and workplaces and touchless deliveries, but there is no guarantee that such models
  will be scalable or be accepted globally. Likewise, as we ramp our energy products, we are working to substantially increase our
  production and installation capabilities. If we experience production delays or inaccurately forecast demand, our business, financial
  condition and operating results may be harmed.

         Moreover, because of our unique expertise with our vehicles, we recommend that our vehicles be serviced by us or by certain
  authorized professionals. If we experience delays in adding servicing capacity or servicing our vehicles efficiently, or experience
  unforeseen issues with the reliability of our vehicles, particularly higher-volume additions to our fleet such as Model 3 and Model Y,
  it could overburden our servicing capabilities and parts inventory. Similarly, the increasing number of Tesla vehicles also requires us
  to continue to rapidly increase the number of our Supercharger stations and connectors throughout the world.

        There is no assurance that we will be able to ramp our business to meet our sales, delivery, installation, servicing and vehicle
  charging targets globally, that our projections on which such targets are based will prove accurate or that the pace of growth or
  coverage of our customer infrastructure network will meet customer expectations. These plans require significant cash investments
  and management resources and there is no guarantee that they will generate additional sales or installations of our products, or that
  we will be able to avoid cost overruns or be able to hire additional personnel to support them. As we expand, we will also need to
  ensure our compliance with regulatory requirements in various jurisdictions applicable to the sale, installation and servicing of our
  products, the sale or dispatch of electricity related to our energy products and the operation of Superchargers. If we fail to manage
  our growth effectively, it may harm our brand, business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.

        We will need to maintain and significantly grow our access to battery cells, including through the development and
        manufacture of our own cells, and control our related costs.
         We are dependent on the continued supply of lithium-ion battery cells for our vehicles and energy storage products, and we
  will require substantially more cells to grow our business according to our plans. Currently, we rely on suppliers such as Panasonic
  and Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Limited (CATL) for these cells. We have to date fully qualified only a very limited
  number of such suppliers and have limited flexibility in changing suppliers. Any disruption in the supply of battery cells from our
  suppliers could limit production of our vehicles and energy storage products. In the long term, we intend to supplement cells from
  our suppliers with cells manufactured by us, which we believe will be more efficient, manufacturable at greater volumes and more
  cost-effective
                                                                    16

25/04/23, 17:14                                                                    10-K


  than currently available cells. However, our efforts to develop and manufacture such battery cells have required, and may continue to
  require, significant investments, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve these targets in the timeframes that we
  have planned or at all. If we are unable to do so, we may have to curtail our planned vehicle and energy storage product production
  or procure additional cells from suppliers at potentially greater costs, either of which may harm our business and operating results.

         In addition, the cost and mass production of battery cells, whether manufactured by our suppliers or by us, depends in part
  upon the prices and availability of raw materials such as lithium, nickel, cobalt and/or other metals. The prices for these materials
  fluctuate and their available supply may be unstable, depending on market conditions and global demand for these materials. For
  example, as a result of increased global production of electric vehicles and energy storage products, suppliers of these raw materials
  may be unable to meet our volume needs. Additionally, our suppliers may not be willing or able to reliably meet our timelines or our
  cost and quality needs, which may require us to replace them with other sources. Any reduced availability of these materials may
  impact our access to cells and our growth, and any increases in their prices may reduce our profitability if we cannot recoup such
  costs through increased prices. Moreover, our inability to meet demand and any product price increases may harm our brand,
  growth, prospects and operating results.

        Our future growth and success are dependent upon consumers’ demand for electric vehicles and specifically our vehicles in
        an automotive industry that is generally competitive, cyclical and volatile.
        Though we continue to see increased interest and adoption of electric vehicles, if the market for electric vehicles in general
  and Tesla vehicles in particular does not develop as we expect, develops more slowly than we expect, or if demand for our vehicles
  decreases in our markets or our vehicles compete with each other, our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results
  may be harmed.

        In addition, electric vehicles still constitute a small percentage of overall vehicle sales. As a result, the market for our vehicles
  could be negatively affected by numerous factors, such as:
        •         perceptions about electric vehicle features, quality, safety, performance and cost;
        •         perceptions about the limited range over which electric vehicles may be driven on a single battery charge, and access to
                  charging facilities;
        •         competition, including from other types of alternative fuel vehicles, plug-in hybrid electric vehicles and high fuel-
                  economy internal combustion engine vehicles;
        •         volatility in the cost of oil, gasoline and energy, such as wide fluctuations in crude oil prices during 2020;
        •         government regulations and economic incentives and conditions; and
        •         concerns about our future viability.

         Finally, the target demographics for our vehicles, particularly Model 3 and Model Y, are highly competitive. Sales of vehicles
  in the automotive industry tend to be cyclical in many markets, which may expose us to further volatility.

        We face strong competition for our products and services from a growing list of established and new competitors.
        The worldwide automotive market is highly competitive today and we expect it will become even more so in the future. For
  example, Model 3 and Model Y face competition from existing and future automobile manufacturers in the extremely competitive
  entry-level premium sedan and compact SUV markets. A significant and growing number of established and new automobile
  manufacturers, as well as other companies, have entered, or are reported to have plans to enter, the market for electric and other
  alternative fuel vehicles, including hybrid, plug-in hybrid and fully electric vehicles, as well as the market for self-driving
  technology and other vehicle applications and software platforms. In some cases, our competitors offer or will offer electric vehicles
  in important markets such as China and Europe, and/or have announced an intention to produce electric vehicles exclusively at some
  point in the future. Many of our competitors have significantly more or better-established resources than we do to devote to the
  design, development, manufacturing, distribution, promotion, sale and support of their products. Increased competition could result
  in our lower vehicle unit sales, price reductions, revenue shortfalls, loss of customers and loss of market share, which may harm our
  business, financial condition and operating results.

         We also face competition in our energy generation and storage business from other manufacturers, developers, installers and
  service providers of competing energy technologies, as well as from large utilities. Decreases in the retail or wholesale prices of
  electricity from utilities or other renewable energy sources could make our products less attractive to customers and lead to an
  increased rate of customer defaults.

                                                                         17

  Risks Related to Our Operations
        We may experience issues with lithium-ion cells or other components manufactured at our Gigafactories, which may harm
        the production and profitability of our vehicle and energy storage products.
         Our plan to grow the volume and profitability of our vehicles and energy storage products depends on significant lithium-ion
  battery cell production, including by our partner Panasonic at Gigafactory Nevada. We also produce several vehicle components at
  our Gigafactories, such as battery modules and packs and drive units, and manufacture energy storage products. In the past, some of
  the manufacturing lines for certain product components took longer than anticipated to ramp to their full capacity, and additional
  bottlenecks may arise in the future as we continue to increase the production rate and introduce new lines. In addition, as the IRA
  provides new incentives for domestic energy production and manufacturing, we may face increasing competition from other
  automobile manufacturers as well as suppliers for the resources and capacity to build additional factories and expand our operations
  domestically. If we are unable to or otherwise do not maintain and grow our respective operations, or if we are unable to do so cost-
  effectively or hire and retain highly-skilled personnel there, our ability to manufacture our products profitably would be limited,
  which may harm our business and operating results.

         Finally, the high volumes of lithium-ion cells and battery modules and packs manufactured by us and by our suppliers are
  stored and recycled at our various facilities. Any mishandling of these products may cause disruption to the operation of such
  facilities. While we have implemented safety procedures related to the handling of the cells, there can be no assurance that a safety
  issue or fire related to the cells would not disrupt our operations. Any such disruptions or issues may harm our brand and business.

        We face risks associated with maintaining and expanding our international operations, including unfavorable and
        uncertain regulatory, political, economic, tax and labor conditions.
        We are subject to legal and regulatory requirements, political uncertainty and social, environmental and economic conditions
  in numerous jurisdictions, including markets in which we generate significant sales, over which we have little control and which are
  inherently unpredictable. Our operations in such jurisdictions, particularly as a company based in the U.S., create risks relating to
  conforming our products to regulatory and safety requirements and charging and other electric infrastructures; organizing local
  operating entities; establishing, staffing and managing foreign business locations; attracting local customers; navigating foreign
  government taxes, regulations and permit requirements; enforceability of our contractual rights; trade restrictions, customs
  regulations, tariffs and price or exchange controls; and preferences in foreign nations for domestically manufactured products. Such
  conditions may increase our costs, impact our ability to sell our products and require significant management attention, and may
  harm our business if we are unable to manage them effectively.

        Our business may suffer if our products or features contain defects, fail to perform as expected or take longer than
        expected to become fully functional.
         If our products contain design or manufacturing defects that cause them not to perform as expected or that require repair, or
  certain features of our vehicles such as new Autopilot or FSD features take longer than expected to become enabled, are legally
  restricted or become subject to onerous regulation, our ability to develop, market and sell our products and services may be harmed,
  and we may experience delivery delays, product recalls, product liability, breach of warranty and consumer protection claims and
  significant warranty and other expenses. There is no guarantee that any incremental changes in the specific equipment we deploy in
  our vehicles over time will not result in initial functional disparities from prior iterations or will perform as expected in the
  timeframe we anticipate, or at all.

        Our products are also highly dependent on software, which is inherently complex and may contain latent defects or errors or
  be subject to external attacks. Issues experienced by our customers have included those related to taillights, seat belt chimes and
  display screens in certain Tesla models. Although we attempt to remedy any issues we observe in our products as effectively and
  rapidly as possible, such efforts may not be timely, may hamper production or may not completely satisfy our customers. While we
  have performed, and continue to perform, extensive internal testing on our products and features, we currently have a limited frame
  of reference by which to evaluate their long-term quality, reliability, durability and performance characteristics. There can be no
  assurance that we will be able to detect and fix any defects in our products prior to their sale to or installation for customers.

        We may be required to defend or insure against product liability claims.
         The automobile industry generally experiences significant product liability claims, and as such we face the risk of such claims
  in the event our vehicles do not perform or are claimed to not have performed as expected. As is true for other automakers, our
  vehicles have been involved and we expect in the future will be involved in accidents resulting in death or personal injury, and such
  accidents where Autopilot, Enhanced Autopilot or FSD Capability features are engaged are the subject of significant public
  attention, especially in light of NHTSA’s Standing General Order requiring reports regarding crashes involving vehicles with
  advanced driver assistance systems. We have experienced, and we expect to continue to face, claims and regulatory scrutiny arising
  from or related to misuse or claimed failures or alleged misrepresentations of such new technologies that we are pioneering. In
  addition, the battery packs that we produce make use of lithium-ion cells. On rare occasions, lithium-ion cells can rapidly release the
  energy they contain by venting
                                                                    18

25/04/23, 17:14                                                                10-K


  smoke and flames in a manner that can ignite nearby materials as well as other lithium-ion cells. While we have designed our battery
  packs to passively contain any single cell’s release of energy without spreading to neighboring cells, there can be no assurance that a
  field or testing failure of our vehicles or other battery packs that we produce will not occur, in particular due to a high-speed crash.
  Likewise, as our solar energy systems and energy storage products generate and store electricity, they have the potential to fail or
  cause injury to people or property. Any product liability claim may subject us to lawsuits and substantial monetary damages, product
  recalls or redesign efforts, and even a meritless claim may require us to defend it, all of which may generate negative publicity and
  be expensive and time-consuming. In most jurisdictions, we generally self-insure against the risk of product liability claims for
  vehicle exposure, meaning that any product liability claims will likely have to be paid from company funds and not by insurance.

        We will need to maintain public credibility and confidence in our long-term business prospects in order to succeed.
        In order to maintain and grow our business, we must maintain credibility and confidence among customers, suppliers, analysts,
  investors, ratings agencies and other parties in our long-term financial viability and business prospects. Maintaining such confidence
  may be challenging due to our limited operating history relative to established competitors; customer unfamiliarity with our
  products; any delays we may experience in scaling manufacturing, delivery and service operations to meet demand; competition and
  uncertainty regarding the future of electric vehicles or our other products and services; our quarterly production and sales
  performance compared with market expectations; and other factors including those over which we have no control. In particular,
  Tesla’s products, business, results of operations, and statements and actions of Tesla and its management are well-publicized by a
  range of third parties. Such attention can include criticism, which may be exaggerated or unfounded, such as speculation regarding
  the sufficiency or stability of our management team. Any such negative perceptions, whether caused by us or not, may harm our
  business and make it more difficult to raise additional funds if needed.

        We may be unable to effectively grow, or manage the compliance, residual value, financing and credit risks related to, our
        various financing programs.
        We offer financing arrangements for our vehicles in North America, Europe and Asia primarily ourselves and through various
  financial institutions. We also currently offer vehicle financing arrangements directly through our local subsidiaries in certain
  markets. Depending on the country, such arrangements are available for specified models and may include operating leases directly
  with us under which we typically receive only a very small portion of the total vehicle purchase price at the time of lease, followed
  by a stream of payments over the term of the lease. We have also offered various arrangements for customers of our solar energy
  systems whereby they pay us a fixed payment to lease or finance the purchase of such systems or purchase electricity generated by
  them. If we do not successfully monitor and comply with applicable national, state and/or local financial regulations and consumer
  protection laws governing these transactions, we may become subject to enforcement actions or penalties.

        The profitability of any directly-leased vehicles returned to us at the end of their leases depends on our ability to accurately
  project our vehicles’ residual values at the outset of the leases, and such values may fluctuate prior to the end of their terms
  depending on various factors such as supply and demand of our used vehicles, economic cycles and the pricing of new vehicles. We
  have made in the past and may make in the future certain adjustments to our prices from time to time in the ordinary course of
  business, which may impact the residual values of our vehicles and reduce the profitability of our vehicle leasing program. The
  funding and growth of this program also rely on our ability to secure adequate financing and/or business partners. If we are unable to
  adequately fund our leasing program through internal funds, partners or other financing sources, and compelling alternative
  financing programs are not available for our customers who may expect or need such options, we may be unable to grow our vehicle
  deliveries. Furthermore, if our vehicle leasing business grows substantially, our business may suffer if we cannot effectively manage
  the resulting greater levels of residual risk.

        Similarly, we have provided resale value guarantees to vehicle customers and partners for certain financing programs, under
  which such counterparties may sell their vehicles back to us at certain points in time at pre-determined amounts. However, actual
  resale values are subject to fluctuations over the term of the financing arrangements, such as from the vehicle pricing changes
  discussed above. If the actual resale values of any vehicles resold or returned to us pursuant to these programs are materially lower
  than the pre-determined amounts we have offered, our financial condition and operating results may be harmed.

       Finally, our vehicle and solar energy system financing programs and our energy storage sales programs also expose us to
  customer credit risk. In the event of a widespread economic downturn or other catastrophic event, our customers may be unable or
  unwilling to satisfy their payment obligations to us on a timely basis or at all. If a significant number of our customers default, we
  may incur substantial credit losses and/or impairment charges with respect to the underlying assets.
                                                                     19

        We must manage ongoing obligations under our agreement with the Research Foundation for the State University of New
        York relating to our Gigafactory New York.
        We are party to an operating lease and a research and development agreement through the State University of New York (the
  “SUNY Foundation”). These agreements provide for the construction and use of our Gigafactory New York, which we have
  primarily used for the development and production of our Solar Roof and other solar products and components, energy storage
  components and Supercharger components, and for other lessor-approved functions. Under this agreement, we are obligated to,
  among other things, meet employment targets as well as specified minimum numbers of personnel in the State of New York and in
  Buffalo, New York and spend or incur $5.00 billion in combined capital, operational expenses, costs of goods sold and other costs in
  the State of New York during a period that was initially 10 years beginning April 30, 2018. As of December 31, 2022, we are
  currently in excess of such targets relating to investments and personnel in the State of New York and Buffalo. While we expect to
  have and grow significant operations at Gigafactory New York and the surrounding Buffalo area, any failure by us in any year over
  the course of the term of the agreement to meet all applicable future obligations may result in our obligation to pay a “program
  payment” of $41 million to the SUNY Foundation for such year, the termination of our lease at Gigafactory New York which may
  require us to pay additional penalties, and/or the need to adjust certain of our operations, in particular our production ramp of the
  Solar Roof or other components. Any of the foregoing events may harm our business, financial condition and operating results.

        If we are unable to attract, hire and retain key employees and qualified personnel, our ability to compete may be harmed.
        The loss of the services of any of our key employees or any significant portion of our workforce could disrupt our operations
  or delay the development, introduction and ramp of our products and services. In particular, we are highly dependent on the services
  of Elon Musk, Technoking of Tesla and our Chief Executive Officer. None of our key employees is bound by an employment
  agreement for any specific term and we may not be able to successfully attract and retain senior leadership necessary to grow our
  business. Our future success also depends upon our ability to attract, hire and retain a large number of engineering, manufacturing,
  marketing, sales and delivery, service, installation, technology and support personnel, especially to support our planned high-volume
  product sales, market and geographical expansion and technological innovations. If we are not successful in managing these risks,
  our business, financial condition and operating results may be harmed.

        Employees may leave Tesla or choose other employers over Tesla due to various factors, such as a very competitive labor
  market for talented individuals with automotive or technology experience, or any negative publicity related to us. In regions where
  we have or will have operations, particularly significant engineering and manufacturing centers, there is strong competition for
  individuals with skillsets needed for our business, including specialized knowledge of electric vehicles, engineering and electrical
  and building construction expertise. Moreover, we may be impacted by perceptions relating to reductions in force that we have
  conducted in the past in order to optimize our organizational structure and reduce costs and the departure of certain senior personnel
  for various reasons. We also compete with both mature and prosperous companies that have far greater financial resources than we
  do and start-ups and emerging companies that promise short-term growth opportunities.

        Finally, our compensation philosophy for all of our personnel reflects our startup origins, with an emphasis on equity-based
  awards and benefits in order to closely align their incentives with the long-term interests of our stockholders. We periodically seek
  and obtain approval from our stockholders for future increases to the number of awards available under our equity incentive and
  employee stock purchase plans. If we are unable to obtain the requisite stockholder approvals for such future increases, we may have
  to expend additional cash to compensate our employees and our ability to retain and hire qualified personnel may be harmed.

        We are highly dependent on the services of Elon Musk, Technoking of Tesla and our Chief Executive Officer.
        We are highly dependent on the services of Elon Musk, Technoking of Tesla and our Chief Executive Officer. Although Mr.
  Musk spends significant time with Tesla and is highly active in our management, he does not devote his full time and attention to
  Tesla. Mr. Musk also currently serves as Chief Executive Officer and Chief Technical Officer of Space Exploration Technologies
  Corp., a developer and manufacturer of space launch vehicles, Chief Executive Officer of Twitter, Inc., a social media company, and
  is involved in other emerging technology ventures.

        Our information technology systems or data, or those of our service providers or customers or users could be subject to
        cyber-attacks or other security incidents, which could result in data breaches, intellectual property theft, claims, litigation,
        regulatory investigations, significant liability, reputational damage and other adverse consequences.
         We continue to expand our information technology systems as our operations grow, such as product data management,
  procurement, inventory management, production planning and execution, sales, service and logistics, dealer management, financial,
  tax and regulatory compliance systems. This includes the implementation of new internally developed systems and the deployment
  of such systems in the U.S. and abroad. While, we maintain information technology measures designed to protect us against
  intellectual property theft, data breaches, sabotage and other external or internal cyber-attacks or misappropriation, our systems and
  those of our service providers are potentially vulnerable to malware, ransomware, viruses, denial-of-service attacks, phishing
  attacks, social engineering, computer hacking, unauthorized access, exploitation of bugs, defects and vulnerabilities, breakdowns,
  damage, interruptions, system malfunctions, power outages, terrorism, acts of vandalism, security breaches, security incidents,
  inadvertent or intentional actions by employees or other third parties, and other cyber-attacks.

        To the extent any security incident results in unauthorized access or damage to or acquisition, use, corruption, loss,
  destruction, alteration or dissemination of our data, including intellectual property and personal information, or our products or
  vehicles, or for it to be believed or reported that any of these occurred, it could disrupt our business, harm our reputation, compel us
  to comply with applicable data breach notification laws, subject us to time consuming, distracting and expensive litigation,
  regulatory investigation and oversight, mandatory corrective action, require us to verify the correctness of database contents, or
  otherwise subject us to liability under laws, regulations and contractual obligations, including those that protect the privacy and
  security of personal information. This could result in increased costs to us and result in significant legal and financial exposure
  and/or reputational harm.

        We also rely on service providers, and similar incidents relating to their information technology systems could also have a
  material adverse effect on our business. There have been and may continue to be significant supply chain attacks. Our service
  providers, including our workforce management software provider, have been subject to ransomware and other security incidents,
  and we cannot guarantee that our or our service providers’ systems have not been breached or that they do not contain exploitable
  defects, bugs, or vulnerabilities that could result in a security incident, or other disruption to, our or our service providers’ systems.
  Our ability to monitor our service providers’ security measures is limited, and, in any event, malicious third parties may be able to
  circumvent those security measures.

        Further, the implementation, maintenance, segregation and improvement of these systems require significant management
  time, support and cost, and there are inherent risks associated with developing, improving and expanding our core systems as well as
  implementing new systems and updating current systems, including disruptions to the related areas of business operation. These
  risks may affect our ability to manage our data and inventory, procure parts or supplies or manufacture, sell, deliver and service
  products, adequately protect our intellectual property or achieve and maintain compliance with, or realize available benefits under,
  tax laws and other applicable regulations.

        Moreover, if we do not successfully implement, maintain or expand these systems as planned, our operations may be
  disrupted, our ability to accurately and/or timely report our financial results could be impaired and deficiencies may arise in our
  internal control over financial reporting, which may impact our ability to certify our financial results. Moreover, our proprietary
  information, including intellectual property and personal information, could be compromised or misappropriated and our reputation
  may be adversely affected. If these systems or their functionality do not operate as we expect them to, we may be required to expend
  significant resources to make corrections or find alternative sources for performing these functions.

        Any unauthorized control or manipulation of our products’ systems could result in loss of confidence in us and our
        products.
        Our products contain complex information technology systems. For example, our vehicles and energy storage products are
  designed with built-in data connectivity to accept and install periodic remote updates from us to improve or update their
  functionality. While we have implemented security measures intended to prevent unauthorized access to our information technology
  networks, our products and their systems, malicious entities have reportedly attempted, and may attempt in the future, to gain
  unauthorized access to modify, alter and use such networks, products and systems to gain control of, or to change, our products’
  functionality, user interface and performance characteristics or to gain access to data stored in or generated by our products. We
  encourage reporting of potential vulnerabilities in the security of our products through our security vulnerability reporting policy,
  and we aim to remedy any reported and verified vulnerability. However, there can be no assurance that any vulnerabilities will not
  be exploited before they can be identified, or that our remediation efforts are or will be successful.

         Any unauthorized access to or control of our products or their systems or any loss of data could result in legal claims or
  government investigations. In addition, regardless of their veracity, reports of unauthorized access to our products, their systems or
  data, as well as other factors that may result in the perception that our products, their systems or data are capable of being hacked,
  may harm our brand, prospects and operating results. We have been the subject of such reports in the past.
                                                                       21

        Our business may be adversely affected by any disruptions caused by union activities.
         It is not uncommon for employees of certain trades at companies such as ours to belong to a union, which can result in higher
  employee costs and increased risk of work stoppages. Moreover, regulations in some jurisdictions outside of the U.S. mandate
  employee participation in industrial collective bargaining agreements and work councils with certain consultation rights with respect
  to the relevant companies’ operations. Although we work diligently to provide the best possible work environment for our
  employees, they may still decide to join or seek recognition to form a labor union, or we may be required to become a union
  signatory. From time to time, labor unions have engaged in campaigns to organize certain of our operations, as part of which such
  unions have filed unfair labor practice charges against us with the National Labor Relations Board (the “NLRB”), and they may do
  so in the future. In September 2019, an administrative law judge issued a recommended decision for Tesla on certain issues and
  against us on certain others. In March 2021, the NLRB adopted a portion of the recommendation and overturned others. Tesla
  appealed the decision to the United States Circuit Court for the Fifth Circuit, which is currently pending. Any unfavorable ultimate
  outcome for Tesla may have a negative impact on the perception of Tesla’s treatment of our employees. Furthermore, we are directly
  or indirectly dependent upon companies with unionized work forces, such as suppliers and trucking and freight companies. Any
  work stoppages or strikes organized by such unions could delay the manufacture and sale of our products and may harm our
  business and operating results.

        We may choose to or be compelled to undertake product recalls or take other similar actions.
         As a manufacturing company, we must manage the risk of product recalls with respect to our products. Recalls for our vehicles
  have resulted from various hardware and software-related safety defect or non-compliance determinations. In addition to recalls
  initiated by us for various causes, testing of or investigations into our products by government regulators or industry groups may
  compel us to initiate product recalls or may result in negative public perceptions about the safety of our products, even if we
  disagree with the defect determination or have data that contradicts it. In the future, we may voluntarily or involuntarily initiate
  recalls if any of our products are determined by us or a regulator to contain a safety defect or be noncompliant with applicable laws
  and regulations, such as U.S. Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards. Such recalls, whether voluntary or involuntary or caused by
  systems or components engineered or manufactured by us or our suppliers, could result in significant expense, supply chain
  complications and service burdens, and may harm our brand, business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.

        Our current and future warranty reserves may be insufficient to cover future warranty claims.
        We provide a manufacturer’s warranty on all new and used Tesla vehicles we sell. We also provide certain warranties with
  respect to the energy generation and storage systems we sell, including on their installation and maintenance. For components not
  manufactured by us, we generally pass through to our customers the applicable manufacturers’ warranties, but may retain some
  warranty responsibilities for some or all of the life of such components. As part of our energy generation and storage system
  contracts, we may provide the customer with performance guarantees that guarantee that the underlying system will meet or exceed
  the minimum energy generation or other energy performance requirements specified in the contract. Under these performance
  guarantees, we generally bear the risk of electricity production or other performance shortfalls, including in some cases shortfalls
  caused by failures in components from third party manufacturers. These risks are exacerbated in the event such manufacturers cease
  operations or fail to honor their warranties.

        If our warranty reserves are inadequate to cover future warranty claims on our products, our financial condition and operating
  results may be harmed. Warranty reserves include our management’s best estimates of the projected costs to repair or to replace
  items under warranty, which are based on actual claims incurred to date and an estimate of the nature, frequency and costs of future
  claims. Such estimates are inherently uncertain and changes to our historical or projected experience, especially with respect to
  products that we have introduced relatively recently and/or that we expect to produce at significantly greater volumes than our past
  products, may cause material changes to our warranty reserves in the future.

        Our insurance coverage strategy may not be adequate to protect us from all business risks.
         We may be subject, in the ordinary course of business, to losses resulting from products liability, accidents, acts of God and
  other claims against us, for which we may have no insurance coverage. As a general matter, we do not maintain as much insurance
  coverage as many other companies do, and in some cases, we do not maintain any at all. Additionally, the policies that we do have
  may include significant deductibles or self-insured retentions, policy limitations and exclusions, and we cannot be certain that our
  insurance coverage will be sufficient to cover all future losses or claims against us. A loss that is uninsured or which exceeds policy
  limits may require us to pay substantial amounts, which may harm our financial condition and operating results.
                                                                      22

        Our debt agreements contain covenant restrictions that may limit our ability to operate our business.
         The terms of certain of our debt facilities contain, and any of our other future debt agreements may contain, covenant
  restrictions that may limit our ability to operate our business, including restrictions on our and/or our subsidiaries’ ability to, among
  other things, incur additional debt or create liens. In addition, under certain circumstances we are required to comply with a fixed
  charge coverage ratio. As a result of these covenants, our ability to respond to changes in business and economic conditions and
  engage in beneficial transactions, including to obtain additional financing as needed, may be restricted. Furthermore, our failure to
  comply with our debt covenants could result in a default under our debt agreements, which could permit the holders to accelerate our
  obligation to repay the debt. If any of our debt is accelerated, we may not have sufficient funds available to repay it.

        Additional funds may not be available to us when we need or want them.
        Our business and our future plans for expansion are capital-intensive, and the specific timing of cash inflows and outflows
  may fluctuate substantially from period to period. We may need or want to raise additional funds through the issuance of equity,
  equity-related or debt securities or through obtaining credit from financial institutions to fund, together with our principal sources of
  liquidity, the costs of developing and manufacturing our current or future products, to pay any significant unplanned or accelerated
  expenses or for new significant strategic investments, or to refinance our significant consolidated indebtedness, even if not required
  to do so by the terms of such indebtedness. We cannot be certain that additional funds will be available to us on favorable terms
  when required, or at all. If we cannot raise additional funds when we need them, our financial condition, results of operations,
  business and prospects could be materially and adversely affected.

        We may be negatively impacted by any early obsolescence of our manufacturing equipment.
        We depreciate the cost of our manufacturing equipment over their expected useful lives. However, product cycles or
  manufacturing technology may change periodically, and we may decide to update our products or manufacturing processes more
  quickly than expected. Moreover, improvements in engineering and manufacturing expertise and efficiency may result in our ability
  to manufacture our products using less of our currently installed equipment. Alternatively, as we ramp and mature the production of
  our products to higher levels, we may discontinue the use of already installed equipment in favor of different or additional
  equipment. The useful life of any equipment that would be retired early as a result would be shortened, causing the depreciation on
  such equipment to be accelerated, and our results of operations may be harmed.

        There is no guarantee that we will have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our indebtedness or that we will not
        incur additional indebtedness.
        As of December 31, 2022, we and our subsidiaries had outstanding $2.06 billion in aggregate principal amount of
  indebtedness (see Note 11, Debt, to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K).
  Our consolidated indebtedness may increase our vulnerability to any generally adverse economic and industry conditions. We and
  our subsidiaries may, subject to the limitations in the terms of our existing and future indebtedness, incur additional debt, secure
  existing or future debt or recapitalize our debt.

         Our ability to make scheduled payments of the principal and interest on our indebtedness when due, to make payments upon
  conversion or repurchase demands with respect to our convertible senior notes or to refinance our indebtedness as we may need or
  desire, depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our
  control. Our business may not continue to generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to satisfy our obligations under
  our existing indebtedness and any future indebtedness we may incur, and to make necessary capital expenditures. If we are unable to
  generate such cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as reducing or delaying investments or capital
  expenditures, selling assets, refinancing or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. Our
  ability to refinance existing or future indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. In
  addition, our ability to make payments may be limited by law, by regulatory authority or by agreements governing our future
  indebtedness. We may not be able to engage in these activities on desirable terms or at all, which may result in a default on our
  existing or future indebtedness and harm our financial condition and operating results.
                                                                     23

        We are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates.
         We transact business globally in multiple currencies and have foreign currency risks related to our revenue, costs of revenue,
  operating expenses and localized subsidiary debt denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, currently primarily the
  Chinese yuan, euro, pound sterling and Norwegian krone. To the extent we have significant revenues denominated in such foreign
  currencies, any strengthening of the U.S. dollar would tend to reduce our revenues as measured in U.S. dollars, as we have
  historically experienced, and are currently experiencing. In addition, a portion of our costs and expenses have been, and we
  anticipate will continue to be, denominated in foreign currencies, including the Chinese yuan and Japanese yen. If we do not have
  fully offsetting revenues in these currencies and if the value of the U.S. dollar depreciates significantly against these currencies, our
  costs as measured in U.S. dollars as a percent of our revenues will correspondingly increase and our margins will suffer. Moreover,
  while we undertake limited hedging activities intended to offset the impact of currency translation exposure, it is impossible to
  predict or eliminate such impact. As a result, our operating results may be harmed.

        We may need to defend ourselves against intellectual property infringement claims, which may be time-consuming and
        expensive.
         Our competitors or other third parties may hold or obtain patents, copyrights, trademarks or other proprietary rights that could
  prevent, limit or interfere with our ability to make, use, develop, sell or market our products and services, which could make it more
  difficult for us to operate our business. From time to time, the holders of such intellectual property rights may assert their rights and
  urge us to take licenses and/or may bring suits alleging infringement or misappropriation of such rights, which could result in
  substantial costs, negative publicity and management attention, regardless of merit. While we endeavor to obtain and protect the
  intellectual property rights that we expect will allow us to retain or advance our strategic initiatives, there can be no assurance that
  we will be able to adequately identify and protect the portions of intellectual property that are strategic to our business, or mitigate
  the risk of potential suits or other legal demands by our competitors. Accordingly, we may consider the entering into licensing
  agreements with respect to such rights, although no assurance can be given that such licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or
  that litigation will not occur, and such licenses and associated litigation could significantly increase our operating expenses. In
  addition, if we are determined to have or believe there is a high likelihood that we have infringed upon a third party’s intellectual
  property rights, we may be required to cease making, selling or incorporating certain components or intellectual property into the
  goods and services we offer, to pay substantial damages and/or license royalties, to redesign our products and services and/or to
  establish and maintain alternative branding for our products and services. In the event that we are required to take one or more such
  actions, our brand, business, financial condition and operating results may be harmed.

        Increased scrutiny and changing expectations from stakeholders with respect to the Company’s ESG practices may result
        in additional costs or risks.
         Companies across many industries are facing increasing scrutiny related to their environmental, social and governance (ESG)
  practices. Investor advocacy groups, certain institutional investors, investment funds and other influential investors are also
  increasingly focused on ESG practices and in recent years have placed increasing importance on the non-financial impacts of their
  investments. While our mission is to accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy, if our ESG practices do not meet
  investor or other industry stakeholder expectations, which continue to evolve, we may incur additional costs and our brand, ability to
  attract and retain qualified employees and business may be harmed.

        Our operations could be adversely affected by events outside of our control, such as natural disasters, wars or health
        epidemics.
        We may be impacted by natural disasters, wars, health epidemics, weather conditions, the long-term effects of climate change,
  power outages or other events outside of our control. For example, our Fremont Factory and Gigafactory Nevada are located in
  seismically active regions in Northern California and Nevada, and our Gigafactory Shanghai is located in a flood-prone area.
  Moreover, the area in which our Gigafactory Texas is located experienced severe winter storms in the first quarter of 2021 that had a
  widespread impact on utilities and transportation. If major disasters such as earthquakes, floods or other climate-related events
  occur, or our information system or communication breaks down or operates improperly, our headquarters and production facilities
  may be seriously damaged, or we may have to stop or delay production and shipment of our products. In addition, the global
  COVID-19 pandemic has impacted economic markets, manufacturing operations, supply chains, employment and consumer
  behavior in nearly every geographic region and industry across the world, and we have been, and may in the future be, adversely
  affected as a result. Also, the broader consequences in the current conflict between Russia and Ukraine, which may include further
  embargoes, regional instability and geopolitical shifts; airspace bans relating to certain routes, or strategic decisions to alter certain
  routes; and potential retaliatory action by the Russian government against companies, and the extent of the conflict on our business
  and operating results cannot be predicted. We may incur expenses or delays relating to such events outside of our control, which
  could have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition.
                                                                     24

  Risks Related to Government Laws and Regulations
        Demand for our products and services may be impacted by the status of government and economic incentives supporting
        the development and adoption of such products.
        Government and economic incentives that support the development and adoption of electric vehicles in the U.S. and abroad,
  including certain tax exemptions, tax credits and rebates, may be reduced, eliminated or exhausted from time to time. For example,
  previously available incentives favoring electric vehicles in areas including Ontario, Canada, Netherlands, Italy, Hong Kong and
  California have expired or were cancelled or temporarily unavailable, and in some cases were not eventually replaced or reinstituted,
  which may have negatively impacted sales. Certain government and economic incentives, similar to the IRA, may also be
  implemented that provide benefits to manufacturers who assemble domestically, have local suppliers or have other characteristics
  that may not apply to Tesla. Such developments could negatively impact demand for our vehicles, and we and our customers may
  have to adjust to them, including through pricing modifications.

         In addition, certain governmental rebates, tax credits and other financial incentives that are currently available with respect to
  our solar and energy storage product businesses allow us to lower our costs and encourage customers to buy our products and
  investors to invest in our solar financing funds. However, these incentives may expire when the allocated funding is exhausted,
  reduced or terminated as renewable energy adoption rates increase, sometimes without warning. Likewise, in jurisdictions where net
  metering is currently available, our customers receive bill credits from utilities for energy that their solar energy systems generate
  and export to the grid in excess of the electric load they use. The benefit available under net metering has been or has been proposed
  to be reduced, altered or eliminated in several jurisdictions, and has also been contested and may continue to be contested before the
  Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Any reductions or terminations of such incentives may harm our business, prospects,
  financial condition and operating results by making our products less competitive for customers, increasing our cost of capital and
  adversely impacting our ability to attract investment partners and to form new financing funds for our solar and energy storage
  assets.

        Finally, we and our fund investors claim these U.S. federal tax credits and certain state incentives in amounts based on
  independently appraised fair market values of our solar and energy storage systems. Some governmental authorities have audited
  such values and in certain cases have determined that these values should be lower, and they may do so again in the future. Such
  determinations may result in adverse tax consequences and/or our obligation to make indemnification or other payments to our funds
  or fund investors.

        We are subject to evolving laws and regulations that could impose substantial costs, legal prohibitions or unfavorable
        changes upon our operations or products.
         As we grow our manufacturing operations in additional regions, we are or will be subject to complex environmental,
  manufacturing, health and safety laws and regulations at numerous jurisdictional levels in the U.S., China, Germany and other
  locations abroad, including laws relating to the use, handling, storage, recycling, disposal and/or human exposure to hazardous
  materials, product material inputs and post-consumer products and with respect to constructing, expanding and maintaining our
  facilities. New, or changes in, environmental and climate change laws, regulations or rules could also lead to increased costs of
  compliance, including remediations of any discovered issues, and changes to our operations, which may be significant, and any
  failures to comply could result in significant expenses, delays or fines. In addition, as we have increased our employee headcount
  and operations, we are and may continue to be subject to increased scrutiny, including litigation and government investigations
  relating to allegations such as discrimination and workplace misconduct, that we will need to defend against. If we are unable to
  successfully defend ourselves in such litigation or government investigations, it may harm our brand, ability to attract and retain
  qualified employees, business and financial condition. We are also subject to laws and regulations applicable to the supply,
  manufacture, import, sale, service and performance of our products both domestically and abroad. For example, in countries outside
  of the U.S., we are required to meet standards relating to vehicle safety, fuel economy and emissions that are often materially
  different from equivalent requirements in the U.S., thus resulting in additional investment into the vehicles and systems to ensure
  regulatory compliance in all countries. This process may include official review and certification of our vehicles by foreign

  requirements.

        In particular, we offer in our vehicles in certain markets Autopilot and FSD Capability features that today assist drivers with
  certain tedious and potentially dangerous aspects of road travel, but which currently require drivers to remain fully engaged in the
  driving operation. We are continuing to develop our Autopilot and FSD Capability technology. There are a variety of international,
  federal and state regulations that may apply to, and may adversely affect, the design and performance, sale, registration and
  operation of Autopilot and FSD Capability, and future capability, including full self-driving vehicles that may not be operated by a
  human driver. This includes many existing vehicle standards that were not originally intended to apply to vehicles that may not be
  operated by a human driver. Such regulations continue to rapidly change, which increases the likelihood of a patchwork of complex
  or conflicting regulations, or may delay, restrict or prohibit the availability of certain functionalities and vehicle designs, which
  could adversely affect our business.

  grid services through virtual power plant models, we are impacted by federal, state and local regulations and policies concerning the
  import or export of components, electricity pricing, the interconnection of electricity generation and storage equipment with the
  electrical grid and the sale of electricity generated by third party-owned systems. If regulations and policies are introduced that
  adversely impact the import or export of components, or the interconnection, maintenance or use of our solar and energy storage
  systems, they could deter potential customers from purchasing our solar and energy storage products and services, threaten the
  economics of our existing contracts and cause us to cease solar and energy storage system sales and services in the relevant
  jurisdictions, which may harm our business, financial condition and operating results.

        Any failure by us to comply with a variety of U.S. and international privacy and consumer protection laws may harm us.
         Any failure by us or our vendor or other business partners to comply with our public privacy notice or with federal, state or
  international privacy, data protection or security laws or regulations relating to the processing, collection, use, retention, security and
  transfer of personally identifiable information could result in regulatory or litigation-related actions against us, legal liability, fines,
  damages, ongoing audit requirements and other significant costs. Substantial expenses and operational changes may be required in
  connection with maintaining compliance with such laws, and even an unsuccessful challenge by customers or regulatory authorities
  of our activities could result in adverse publicity and could require a costly response from and defense by us. In addition, certain
  emerging privacy laws are still subject to a high degree of uncertainty as to their interpretation, application and impact, and may
  require extensive system and operational changes, be difficult to implement, increase our operating costs, adversely impact the cost
  or attractiveness of the products or services we offer, or result in adverse publicity and harm our reputation. For example, the
  General Data Protection Regulation applies to the processing of personal information collected from individuals located in the
  European Union, and has created new compliance obligations and significantly increased fines for noncompliance. Similarly, the
  California Consumer Privacy Act imposes certain legal obligations on our use and processing of personal information related to
  California residents. Finally, new privacy and cybersecurity laws have come into effect in China. In addition to the risks related to
  general privacy regulation, we may also be subject to specific vehicle manufacturer obligations relating to cybersecurity, data
  privacy and data localization requirements which place additional risks to our international operations. Risks and penalties could
  include ongoing audit requirements, data protection authority investigations, legal proceedings by international governmental
  entities or others resulting in mandated disclosure of sensitive data or other commercially unfavorable terms. Notwithstanding our
  efforts to protect the security and integrity of our customers’ personal information, we may be required to expend significant
  resources to comply with data breach requirements if, for example, third parties improperly obtain and use the personal information
  of our customers or we otherwise experience a data loss with respect to customers’ personal information. A major breach of our
  network security and systems may result in fines, penalties and damages and harm our brand, prospects and operating results.

        We could be subject to liability, penalties and other restrictive sanctions and adverse consequences arising out of certain
        governmental investigations and proceedings.
         We are cooperating with certain government investigations as discussed in Note 15, Commitments and Contingencies, to the
  consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. To our knowledge, no government
  agency in any such ongoing investigation has concluded that any wrongdoing occurred. However, we cannot predict the outcome or
  impact of any such ongoing matters, and there exists the possibility that we could be subject to liability, penalties and other
  restrictive sanctions and adverse consequences if the SEC, the U.S. Department of Justice or any other government agency were to
  pursue legal action in the future. Moreover, we expect to incur costs in responding to related requests for information and subpoenas,
  and if instituted, in defending against any governmental proceedings.

         For example, on October 16, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment
  approving the terms of a settlement filed with the Court on September 29, 2018, in connection with the actions taken by the SEC
  relating to Mr. Musk’s statement on August 7, 2018 that he was considering taking Tesla private. Pursuant to the settlement, we,
  among other things, paid a civil penalty of $20 million, appointed an independent director as the chair of our board of directors,
  appointed two additional independent directors to our board of directors and made further enhancements to our disclosure controls
  and other corporate governance-related matters. On April 26, 2019, this settlement was amended to clarify certain of the previously-
  agreed disclosure procedures, which was subsequently approved by the Court. All other terms of the prior settlement were
  reaffirmed without modification. Although we intend to continue to comply with the terms and requirements of the settlement, if
  there is a lack of compliance or an alleged lack of compliance, additional enforcement actions or other legal proceedings may be
  instituted against us.
                                                                    26

        We may face regulatory challenges to or limitations on our ability to sell vehicles directly.
         While we intend to continue to leverage our most effective sales strategies, including sales through our website, we may not be
  able to sell our vehicles through our own stores in certain states in the U.S. with laws that may be interpreted to impose limitations
  on this direct-to-consumer sales model. It has also been asserted that the laws in some states limit our ability to obtain dealer licenses
  from state motor vehicle regulators, and such assertions persist. In certain locations, decisions by regulators permitting us to sell
  vehicles have been, and may be, challenged by dealer associations and others as to whether such decisions comply with applicable
  state motor vehicle industry laws. We have prevailed in many of these lawsuits and such results have reinforced our continuing
  belief that state franchise laws were not intended to apply to a manufacturer that does not have franchise dealers anywhere in the
  world. In some states, there have also been regulatory and legislative efforts by dealer associations to propose laws that, if enacted,
  would prevent us from obtaining dealer licenses in their states given our current sales model. A few states have passed legislation
  that clarifies our ability to operate, but at the same time limits the number of dealer licenses we can obtain or stores that we can
  operate. The application of state laws applicable to our operations continues to be difficult to predict.

        Internationally, there may be laws in jurisdictions we have not yet entered or laws we are unaware of in jurisdictions we have
  entered that may restrict our sales or other business practices. Even for those jurisdictions we have analyzed, the laws in this area can
  be complex, difficult to interpret and may change over time. Continued regulatory limitations and other obstacles interfering with
  our ability to sell vehicles directly to consumers may harm our financial condition and operating results.

  Risks Related to the Ownership of Our Common Stock
        The trading price of our common stock is likely to continue to be volatile.
         The trading price of our common stock has been highly volatile and could continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in
  response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. Our common stock has experienced over the last 52 weeks an
  intra-day trading high of $384.29 per share and a low of $101.81 per share, as adjusted to give effect to the three-for-one stock split
  in the form of a stock dividend in August 2022 (the “2022 Stock Split”). The stock market in general, and the market for technology
  companies in particular, has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to
  the operating performance of those companies. In particular, a large proportion of our common stock has been historically and may
  in the future be traded by short sellers which may put pressure on the supply and demand for our common stock, further influencing
  volatility in its market price. Public perception of our company or management and other factors outside of our control may
  additionally impact the stock price of companies like us that garner a disproportionate degree of public attention, regardless of actual
  operating performance. In addition, in the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market or the market price of our shares,
  securities class action litigation has been filed against us. While we defend such actions vigorously, any judgment against us or any
  future stockholder litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management’s attention and resources.

        Our financial results may vary significantly from period to period due to fluctuations in our operating costs and other
        factors.
        We expect our period-to-period financial results to vary based on our operating costs, which we anticipate will fluctuate as the
  pace at which we continue to design, develop and manufacture new products and increase production capacity by expanding our
  current manufacturing facilities and adding future facilities, may not be consistent or linear between periods. Additionally, our
  revenues from period to period may fluctuate as we introduce existing products to new markets for the first time and as we develop
  and introduce new products. As a result of these factors, we believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our financial results,
  especially in the short term, are not necessarily meaningful and that these comparisons cannot be relied upon as indicators of future
  performance. Moreover, our financial results may not meet expectations of equity research analysts, ratings agencies or investors,
  who may be focused only on short-term quarterly financial results. If any of this occurs, the trading price of our stock could fall
  substantially, either suddenly or over time.

        We may fail to meet our publicly announced guidance or other expectations about our business, which could cause our
        stock price to decline.
         We may provide from time to time guidance regarding our expected financial and business performance. Correctly identifying
  key factors affecting business conditions and predicting future events is inherently an uncertain process, and our guidance may not
  ultimately be accurate and has in the past been inaccurate in certain respects, such as the timing of new product manufacturing
  ramps. Our guidance is based on certain assumptions such as those relating to anticipated production and sales volumes (which
  generally are not linear throughout a given period), average sales prices, supplier and commodity costs and planned cost reductions.
  If our guidance varies from actual results, such as due to our assumptions not being met or the impact on our financial performance
  that could occur as a result of various risks and uncertainties, the market value of our common stock could decline significantly.
                                                                       27

        If Elon Musk were forced to sell shares of our common stock, either that he has pledged to secure certain personal loan
        obligations, or in satisfaction of other obligations, such sales could cause our stock price to decline.
         Certain banking institutions have made extensions of credit to Elon Musk, our Chief Executive Officer, a portion of which was
  used to purchase shares of common stock in certain of our public offerings and private placements at the same prices offered to
  third-party participants in such offerings and placements. We are not a party to these loans, which are partially secured by pledges of
  a portion of the Tesla common stock currently owned by Mr. Musk. If the price of our common stock were to decline substantially,
  Mr. Musk may be forced by one or more of the banking institutions to sell shares of Tesla common stock to satisfy his loan
  obligations if he could not do so through other means. Any such sales could cause the price of our common stock to decline further.
  Further, Mr. Musk from time to time may commit to investing in significant business or other ventures, and as a result, be required to
  sell shares of our common stock in satisfaction of such commitments.

        Anti-takeover provisions contained in our governing documents, applicable laws and our convertible senior notes could
        impair a takeover attempt.
        Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws afford certain rights and powers to our board of directors that may facilitate the
  delay or prevention of an acquisition that it deems undesirable. We are also subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General
  Corporation Law and other provisions of Delaware law that limit the ability of stockholders in certain situations to effect certain
  business combinations. In addition, the terms of our convertible senior notes may require us to repurchase such notes in the event of
  a fundamental change, including a takeover of our company. Any of the foregoing provisions and terms that has the effect of
  delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our
  common stock, and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock.

        In addition, each of the matters below is being disclosed pursuant to Item 103 of Regulation S-K because it relates to
  environmental regulations and aggregate civil penalties that we currently believe could potentially exceed $1 million. We believe
  that any proceeding that is material to our business or financial condition is likely to have potential penalties far in excess of such
  amount.

         The German Umweltbundesamt issued our subsidiary in Germany a notice and fine in the amount of 12 million euro alleging
  its non-compliance under applicable laws relating to market participation notifications and take-back obligations with respect to end-
  of-life battery products required thereunder. In response to Tesla’s objection, the German Umweltbundesamt issued Tesla a revised
  fine notice dated April 29, 2021 in which it reduced the original fine amount to 1.45 million euro. This is primarily relating to
  administrative requirements, but Tesla has continued to take back battery packs, and filed a new objection in June 2021. A hearing
  took place on November 24, 2022, and the parties reached a settlement which resulted in a further reduction of the fine to 600,000
  euro. Both parties have waived their right to appeal.

        District attorneys in certain California counties are conducting an investigation into Tesla’s waste segregation practices
  pursuant to Cal. Health & Saf. Code section 25100 et seq. and Cal. Civil Code § 1798.80. Tesla has implemented various remedial
  measures, including conducting training and audits, and enhancements to its site waste management programs. While the outcome of
  this matter cannot be determined at this time, it is not currently expected to have a material adverse impact on our business.

  Market Information
        Our common stock has traded on The NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol “TSLA” since it began trading on
  June 29, 2010. Our initial public offering was priced at approximately $1.13 per share on June 28, 2010 as adjusted to give effect to
  the 2022 Stock Split and the five-for-one stock split effected in the form of a stock dividend in August 2020 (the “2020 Stock
  Split”).

  Holders
        As of January 25, 2023, there were 8,686 holders of record of our common stock. A substantially greater number of holders of
  our common stock are “street name” or beneficial holders, whose shares are held by banks, brokers and other financial institutions.

  Dividend Policy
        We have never declared or paid cash dividends on our common stock. We currently do not anticipate paying any cash
  dividends in the foreseeable future. Any future determination to declare cash dividends will be made at the discretion of our board of
  directors, subject to applicable laws, and will depend on our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, general
  business conditions and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant.

      This performance graph shall not be deemed “filed” for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
  amended (the “Exchange Act”), or incorporated by reference into any filing of Tesla, Inc. under the Securities Act of 1933, as
  amended (the “Securities Act”), or the Exchange Act, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing.
        The following graph shows a comparison, from January 1, 2018 through December 31, 2022, of the cumulative total return on
  our common stock, The NASDAQ Composite Index and a group of all public companies sharing the same SIC code as us, which is
  SIC code 3711, “Motor Vehicles and Passenger Car Bodies” (Motor Vehicles and Passenger Car Bodies Public Company Group).
  Such returns are based on historical results and are not intended to suggest future performance. Data for The NASDAQ Composite
  Index and the Motor Vehicles and Passenger Car Bodies Public Company Group assumes an investment of $100 on January 1, 2018
  and reinvestment of dividends. We have never declared or paid cash dividends on our common stock nor do we anticipate paying
  any such cash dividends in the foreseeable future.

  Exchange Commission on February 7, 2022.

  Overview and 2022 Highlights
         Our mission is to accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy. We design, develop, manufacture, lease and sell high-
  performance fully electric vehicles, solar energy generation systems and energy storage products. We also offer maintenance,
  installation, operation, financial and other services related to our products. Additionally, we are increasingly focused on products and
  services based on artificial intelligence, robotics and automation.

         In 2022, we produced 1,369,611 consumer vehicles and delivered 1,313,851 consumer vehicles, despite ongoing supply chain
  and logistics challenges and factory shutdowns. We are currently focused on increasing vehicle production, capacity and delivery
  capabilities, improving and developing battery technologies, improving our FSD capabilities, increasing the affordability and
  efficiency of our vehicles, bringing new products to market and expanding our global infrastructure.

        In 2022, we deployed 6.5 GWh of energy storage products and 348 megawatts of solar energy systems. We are currently
  focused on ramping production of energy storage products, improving our Solar Roof installation capability and efficiency, and
  increasing market share of retrofit and new build solar energy systems.

        In 2022, we recognized total revenues of $81.46 billion, respectively, representing an increase of $27.64 billion, compared to
  the prior year. We continue to ramp production, build new manufacturing capacity and expand our operations to enable increased
  deliveries and deployments of our products and further revenue growth.

         In 2022, our net income attributable to common stockholders was $12.56 billion, representing a favorable change of $7.04
  billion, compared to the prior year. We continue to focus on improving our profitability through production and operational
  efficiencies.

        We ended 2022 with $22.19 billion in cash and cash equivalents and investments, representing an increase of $4.48 billion
  from the end of 2021. Our cash flows provided by operating activities during 2022 and 2021 were $14.72 billion and $11.50 billion,
  respectively, representing an increase of $3.23 billion. Capital expenditures amounted to $7.16 billion during 2022, compared to
  $6.48 billion during 2021. Sustained growth has allowed our business to generally fund itself, and we will continue investing in a
  number of capital-intensive projects in upcoming periods.

25/04/23, 17:14                                                                10-K


         We are focused on growing our manufacturing capacity, which includes ramping all of our production vehicles to their
  installed production capacities as well as increasing production rate, efficiency and capacity at our current factories. The next phase
  of production growth will depend on the ramp at Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg and Gigafactory Texas, as well as our ability to
  add to our available sources of battery cell supply by manufacturing our own cells that we are developing to have high-volume
  output, lower capital and production costs and longer range. Our goals are to improve vehicle performance, decrease production
  costs and increase affordability.

         However, these plans are subject to uncertainties inherent in establishing and ramping manufacturing operations, which may
  be exacerbated by the new product and manufacturing technologies we are introducing, the number of concurrent international
  projects, any industry-wide component constraints, labor shortages and any future impact from events outside of our control such as
  the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, we have set ambitious technological targets with our plans for battery cells as well as for
  iterative manufacturing and design improvements for our vehicles with each new factory.

  Automotive—Demand and Sales
        Our cost reduction efforts, cost innovation strategies, and additional localized procurement and manufacturing are key to our
  vehicles’ affordability, and for example, have allowed us to competitively price our vehicles in China. We will also continue to
  generate demand and brand awareness by improving our vehicles’ performance and functionality, including through products based
  on artificial intelligence such as Autopilot and FSD, and other software features, and delivering new vehicles, such as the Tesla Semi
  in December 2022. Moreover, we expect to continue to benefit from ongoing electrification of the automotive sector and increasing
  environmental awareness.

        However, we operate in a cyclical industry that is sensitive to political and regulatory uncertainty, including with respect to
  trade and the environment, all of which can be compounded by inflationary pressures, rising energy prices, increases in interest rates
  and any future global impact from the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, in the earlier part of 2022, the automotive industry in
  general experienced part shortages and supplier disruptions which impacted production leading to a general increase in vehicle
  pricing. As the year progressed, inflationary pressures increased across the markets in which we operate. In an effort to curb this
  trend, central banks in developed countries raised interest rates rapidly and substantially, impacting the affordability of vehicle lease
  and finance arrangements. Further, sales of vehicles in the automotive industry also tend to be cyclical in many markets, which may
  expose us to increased volatility as we expand and adjust our operations. Moreover, as additional competitors enter the marketplace
  and help bring the world closer to sustainable transportation, we will have to adjust and continue to execute well to maintain our
  momentum. These macroeconomic and industry trends have had, and will likely continue to have, an impact on the pricing of, and
  order rate for our vehicles, and we will continue to adjust accordingly to such developments.

  Automotive—Deliveries and Customer Infrastructure
        As our production increases, we must work constantly to similarly increase vehicle delivery capability so that it does not
  become a bottleneck on our total deliveries. Beginning the second half of 2022, due to continuing challenges caused by vehicle
  transportation capacity during peak delivery periods, we began transitioning to a more even regional mix of vehicle builds each
  week, which led to an increase in cars in transit at the end of the year. Increasing the exports of vehicles manufactured at Gigafactory
  Shanghai has also been effective in mitigating the strain on our deliveries in markets outside of the United States, and we expect to
  benefit further from situating additional factories closer to local markets, including the production launch at Gigafactory Berlin-
  Brandenburg and Gigafactory Austin. As we expand our manufacturing operations globally, we will also have to continue to increase
  and staff our delivery, servicing and charging infrastructure accordingly, maintain our vehicle reliability and optimize our
  Supercharger locations to ensure cost effectiveness and customer satisfaction. In particular, we remain focused on increasing the
  capability and efficiency of our servicing operations.

  Energy Generation and Storage Demand, Production and Deployment
        The long-term success of this business is dependent upon increasing margins through greater volumes. We continue to increase
  the production of our energy storage products to meet high levels of demand. For Megapack, energy storage deployments can vary
  meaningfully quarter to quarter depending on the timing of specific project milestones. For Powerwall, better availability and
  growing grid stability concerns drive higher customer interest. We remain committed to growing our retrofit solar energy business
  by offering a low-cost and simplified online ordering experience. In addition, we continue to seek to improve our installation
  capabilities and price efficiencies for Solar Roof. As these product lines grow, we will have to maintain adequate battery cell supply
  for our energy storage products and hire additional personnel, particularly skilled electricians, to support the ramp of Solar Roof.
                                                                     33

25/04/23, 17:14                                                                10-K




  Cash Flow and Capital Expenditure Trends
        Our capital expenditures are typically difficult to project beyond the short-term given the number and breadth of our core
  projects at any given time, and may further be impacted by uncertainties in future global market conditions. We are simultaneously
  ramping new products, ramping manufacturing facilities on three continents and piloting the development and manufacture of new
  battery cell technologies, and the pace of our capital spend may vary depending on overall priority among projects, the pace at which
  we meet milestones, production adjustments to and among our various products, increased capital efficiencies and the addition of
  new projects. Owing and subject to the foregoing as well as the pipeline of announced projects under development, all other
  continuing infrastructure growth and varying levels of inflation, we currently expect our capital expenditures to be between $6.00 to
  $8.00 billion in 2023 and between $7.00 to $9.00 billion in each of the following two fiscal years.

         Our business has recently been consistently generating cash flow from operations in excess of our level of capital spend, and
  with better working capital management resulting in shorter days sales outstanding than days payable outstanding, our sales growth
  is also facilitating positive cash generation. We have and will continue to utilize such cash flows, among other things, to do more
  vertical integration, expand our product roadmap and provide financing options to our customers. On the other hand, we are likely to
  see heightened levels of capital expenditures during certain periods depending on the specific pace of our capital-intensive projects
  and rising material prices and increasing supply chain and labor expenses resulting from changes in global trade conditions and labor
  availability associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. Overall, we expect our ability to be self-funding to continue as long as
  macroeconomic factors support current trends in our sales.

  Operating Expense Trends
        As long as we see expanding sales, and excluding the potential impact of macroeconomic conditions including increased labor
  costs and impairment charges on certain assets as explained below, we generally expect operating expenses relative to revenues to
  decrease as we continue to increase operational efficiency and process automation. We expect operating expenses to continue to
  grow in 2023 as we are expanding our operations globally.

         In the first quarter of 2021, we invested an aggregate $1.50 billion in bitcoin. As with any investment and consistent with how
  we manage fiat-based cash and cash-equivalent accounts, we may increase or decrease our holdings of digital assets at any time
  based on the needs of the business and our view of market and environmental conditions. Digital assets are considered indefinite-
  lived intangible assets under applicable accounting rules. Accordingly, any decrease in their fair values below our carrying values for
  such assets at any time subsequent to their acquisition will require us to recognize impairment charges, whereas we may make no
  upward revisions for any market price increases until a sale. For any digital assets held now or in the future, these charges may
  negatively impact our profitability in the periods in which such impairments occur even if the overall market values of these assets
  increase. For example, in the year ended December 31, 2022, we recorded $204 million of impairment losses resulting from changes
  to the carrying value of our bitcoin and gains of $64 million on certain conversions of bitcoin into fiat currency by us.

  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
        The consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S.
  (“GAAP”). The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
  reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses and related disclosures. We base our estimates on historical
  experience, as appropriate, and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Changes in
  the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period. Accordingly, actual results could differ significantly
  from the estimates made by our management. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. To the extent that
  there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, our future financial statement presentation, financial
  condition, results of operations and cash flows may be affected.

         The estimates used for, but not limited to, determining significant economic incentive for resale value guarantee arrangements,
  sales return reserves, the collectability of accounts and financing receivables, inventory valuation, warranties, fair value of long-
  lived assets, goodwill, fair value of financial instruments, fair value and residual value of operating lease vehicles and solar energy
  systems subject to leases could be impacted. We have assessed the impact and are not aware of any specific events or circumstances
  that required an update to our estimates and assumptions or materially affected the carrying value of our assets or liabilities as of the
  date of issuance of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These estimates may change as new events occur and additional information is
  obtained. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
                                                                       34

  Revenue Recognition
        Automotive Sales
        Automotive sales revenue includes revenues related to cash and financing deliveries of new vehicles, and specific other
  features and services that meet the definition of a performance obligation under Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 606,
  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASC 606”), including access to our FSD features, internet connectivity, Supercharger
  network and over-the-air software updates. We recognize revenue on automotive sales upon delivery to the customer, which is when
  the control of a vehicle transfers. Payments are typically received at the point control transfers or in accordance with payment terms
  customary to the business, except sales we finance for which payments are collected over the contractual loan term. We also
  recognize a sales return reserve based on historical experience plus consideration for expected future market values, when we offer
  resale value guarantees or similar buyback terms. Other features and services such as access to our internet connectivity, legacy
  programs offering unlimited free Supercharging and over-the-air software updates are provisioned upon control transfer of a vehicle
  and recognized over time on a straight-line basis as we have a stand-ready obligation to deliver such services to the customer. Other
  limited free Supercharging incentives are recognized based on actual usage or expiration, whichever is earlier. We recognize revenue
  related to these other features and services over the performance period, which is generally the expected ownership life of the
  vehicle. Revenue related to FSD is recognized when functionality is delivered to the customer and the portion related to software
  updates is recognized over time. For our obligations related to automotive sales, we estimate standalone selling price by considering
  costs used to develop and deliver the service, third-party pricing of similar options and other information that may be available.

        Any fees that are paid or payable by us to a customer’s lender when we arrange the financing are recognized as an offset
  against automotive sales revenue. Costs to obtain a contract mainly relate to commissions paid to our sales personnel for the sale of
  vehicles. As our contract costs related to automotive sales are typically fulfilled within one year, the costs to obtain a contract are
  expensed as incurred. Amounts billed to customers related to shipping and handling are classified as automotive sales revenue, and
  we have elected to recognize the cost for freight and shipping when control over vehicles, parts or accessories have transferred to the
  customer as an expense in cost of automotive sales revenue. Our policy is to exclude taxes collected from a customer from the
  transaction price of automotive contracts.

         We offer resale value guarantees or similar buy-back terms to certain international customers who purchase vehicles and who
  finance their vehicles through one of our specified commercial banking partners. Under these programs, we receive full payment for
  the vehicle sales price at the time of delivery and our counterparty has the option of selling their vehicle back to us during the
  guarantee period, which currently is generally at the end of the term of the applicable loan or financing program, for a pre-
  determined resale value. We account for such automotive sales as a sale with a right of return when we do not believe the customer
  has a significant economic incentive to exercise the resale value guarantee provided to them at contract inception. The process to
  determine whether there is a significant economic incentive includes a comparison of a vehicle’s estimated market value at the time
  the option is exercisable with the guaranteed resale value to determine the customer’s economic incentive to exercise. On a quarterly
  basis, we assess the estimated market values of vehicles sold with resale value guarantees to determine whether there have been
  changes to the likelihood of future product returns. As we accumulate more data related to the resale values of our vehicles or as
  market conditions change, there may be material changes to their estimated values.

  Inventory Valuation
        Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is computed using standard cost for vehicles and energy
  products, which approximates actual cost on a first-in, first-out basis. We record inventory write-downs for excess or obsolete
  inventories based upon assumptions about current and future demand forecasts. If our inventory on-hand is in excess of our future
  demand forecast, the excess amounts are written-off.

        We also review our inventory to determine whether its carrying value exceeds the net amount realizable upon the ultimate sale
  of the inventory. This requires us to determine the estimated selling price of our vehicles less the estimated cost to convert the
  inventory on-hand into a finished product. Once inventory is written-down, a new, lower cost basis for that inventory is established
  and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis.

        Should our estimates of future selling prices or production costs change, additional and potentially material write-downs may
  be required. A small change in our estimates may result in a material charge to our reported financial results.
                                                                    35

25/04/23, 17:14                                                                10-K




  Warranties
        We provide a manufacturer’s warranty on all new and used vehicles and a warranty on the installation and components of the
  energy generation and storage systems we sell for periods typically between 10 to 25 years. We accrue a warranty reserve for the
  products sold by us, which includes our best estimate of the projected costs to repair or replace items under warranties and recalls if
  identified. These estimates are based on actual claims incurred to date and an estimate of the nature, frequency and costs of future
  claims. These estimates are inherently uncertain given our relatively short history of sales, and changes to our historical or projected
  warranty experience may cause material changes to the warranty reserve in the future. The warranty reserve does not include
  projected warranty costs associated with our vehicles subject to operating lease accounting and our solar energy systems under lease
  contracts or PPAs, as the costs to repair these warranty claims are expensed as incurred. The portion of the warranty reserve
  expected to be incurred within the next 12 months is included within Accrued liabilities and other, while the remaining balance is
  included within Other long-term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. Warranty expense is recorded as a component of Cost
  of revenues in the consolidated statements of operations. Due to the magnitude of our automotive business, accrued warranty
  balance is primarily related to our automotive segment.

  Stock-Based Compensation
         We use the fair value method of accounting for our stock options and restricted stock units (“RSUs”) granted to employees and
  for our employee stock purchase plan (the “ESPP”) to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for the stock-
  based awards. The fair value of stock option awards with only service and/or performance conditions is estimated on the grant or
  offering date using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires inputs such as the
  risk-free interest rate, expected term and expected volatility. These inputs are subjective and generally require significant judgment.
  The fair value of RSUs is measured on the grant date based on the closing fair market value of our common stock. The resulting cost
  is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the awards, usually the
  vesting period, which is generally four years for stock options and RSUs and six months for the ESPP. Stock-based compensation
  expense is recognized on a straight-line basis, net of actual forfeitures in the period.

        For performance-based awards, stock-based compensation expense is recognized over the expected performance achievement
  period of individual performance milestones when the achievement of each individual performance milestone becomes probable.

        As we accumulate additional employee stock-based awards data over time and as we incorporate market data related to our
  common stock, we may calculate significantly different volatilities and expected lives, which could materially impact the valuation
  of our stock-based awards and the stock-based compensation expense that we will recognize in future periods. Stock-based
  compensation expense is recorded in Cost of revenues, Research and development expense and Selling, general and administrative
  expense in the consolidated statements of operations.

  Income Taxes
        We are subject to taxes in the U.S. and in many foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our
  provision for income taxes, our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax
  assets. We make these estimates and judgments about our future taxable income that are based on assumptions that are consistent
  with our future plans. Tax laws, regulations and administrative practices may be subject to change due to economic or political
  conditions including fundamental changes to the tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals. The U.S., many countries in the
  European Union and a number of other countries are actively considering changes in this regard. As of December 31, 2022, we had
  recorded a full valuation allowance on our net U.S. deferred tax assets because we expect that it is more likely than not that our U.S.
  deferred tax assets will not be realized. Should the actual amounts differ from our estimates, the amount of our valuation allowance
  could be materially impacted.

        Furthermore, significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions. In the ordinary course of business, there are
  many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax settlement is uncertain. As a result, we recognize the effect of this
  uncertainty on our tax attributes or taxes payable based on our estimates of the eventual outcome. These effects are recognized
  when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are supportable, we believe that it is more likely than not that some of those
  positions may not be fully sustained upon review by tax authorities. We are required to file income tax returns in the U.S. and
  various foreign jurisdictions, which requires us to interpret the applicable tax laws and regulations in effect in such jurisdictions.
  Such returns are subject to audit by the various federal, state and foreign taxing authorities, who may disagree with respect to our tax
  positions. We believe that our consideration is adequate for all open audit years based on our assessment of many factors, including
  past experience and interpretations of tax law. We review and update our estimates in light of changing facts and circumstances, such
  as the closing of a tax audit, the lapse of a statute of limitations or a change in estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of
  these matters differs from our expectations, such differences may impact income tax expense in the period in which such
  determination is made. The eventual impact on our income tax expense depends in part if we still have a valuation allowance
  recorded against our deferred tax assets in the period that such determination is made.
                                                                        36

  Automotive & Services and Other Segment
        Automotive sales revenue includes revenues related to cash and financing deliveries of new Model S, Model X, Semi, Model
  3, and Model Y vehicles, including access to our FSD features, internet connectivity, free Supercharging programs and over-the-air
  software updates. These deliveries are vehicles that are not subject to lease accounting.

        Automotive regulatory credits includes sales of regulatory credits to other automotive manufacturers. Our revenue from
  automotive regulatory credits is directly related to our new vehicle production, sales and pricing negotiated with our customers. We
  monetize them proactively as new vehicles are sold based on standing arrangements with buyers of such credits, typically as close as
  possible to the production and delivery of the vehicle or changes in regulation impacting the credits.

        Automotive leasing revenue includes the amortization of revenue for vehicles under direct operating lease agreements.
  Additionally, automotive leasing revenue includes direct sales-type leasing programs where we recognize all revenue associated with
  the sales-type lease upon delivery to the customer.

        Services and other revenue consists of non-warranty after-sales vehicle services and parts, paid Supercharging, sales of used
  vehicles, retail merchandise and vehicle insurance revenue.

  2022 compared to 2021

         Automotive sales revenue increased $23.09 billion, or 52%, in the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the year
  ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to an increase of 347,024 Model 3 and Model Y deliveries, and an increase of 38,183
  Model S and Model X deliveries year over year. This was achieved from production ramping of Model Y at Gigafactory Shanghai
  and the Fremont Factory as well as the start of production at Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg and Gigafactory Texas in 2022, at a
  higher combined average selling price from a higher proportion of Model Y sales despite a negative impact from the United States
  dollar strengthening against other foreign currencies in 2022 compared to the prior period. There was also an increase in production
  of Model S and Model X and an increase in the combined average selling price of Model S and Model X with a higher proportion of
  Model X sales, compared to the prior period as deliveries of the new versions of Model S and Model X began ramping in the second
  and fourth quarters of 2021, respectively. Further, during the fourth quarter of 2022, we recognized $324 million in revenue related
  to the general FSD feature release in North America.

        Automotive regulatory credits revenue increased $311 million, or 21%, in the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to
  the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to changes in regulation which entitled us to additional consideration of $288
  million in revenue in the first quarter of 2022 for credits sold previously, in the absence of which we had only an immaterial increase
  in automotive regulatory credits revenue.

        Automotive leasing revenue increased $834 million, or 51%, in the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the year
  ended December 31, 2021. The change is primarily due to an increase in activities under our direct operating lease program as well
  as an increase in direct sales-type leasing revenue.

        Services and other revenue increased $2.29 billion, or 60%, in the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the year
  ended December 31, 2021. The change is primarily due to increase in used vehicle revenue driven by increases in volume and
  average selling prices of used Tesla and non-Tesla vehicles, non-warranty maintenance services revenue as our fleet continues to
  grow, paid Supercharging revenue, insurance services revenue and retail merchandise revenue.
                                                                   37

  Energy Generation and Storage Segment
        Energy generation and storage revenue includes sales and leasing of solar energy generation and energy storage products,
  financing of solar energy generation products, services related to such products and sales of solar energy systems incentives.

  2022 compared to 2021
        Energy generation and storage revenue increased $1.12 billion, or 40%, in the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to
  the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to an increase in energy storage deployments of Megapack, Powerwall and higher
  average selling price of Megapack, as well as on solar cash and loan deployments driven by price increases in 2022.

  Automotive & Services and Other Segment
         Cost of automotive sales revenue includes direct and indirect materials, labor costs, manufacturing overhead, including
  depreciation costs of tooling and machinery, shipping and logistic costs, vehicle connectivity costs, allocations of electricity and
  infrastructure costs related to our free Supercharging programs and reserves for estimated warranty expenses. Cost of automotive
  sales revenues also includes adjustments to warranty expense and charges to write down the carrying value of our inventory when it
  exceeds its estimated net realizable value and to provide for obsolete and on-hand inventory in excess of forecasted demand.

         Cost of automotive leasing revenue includes the depreciation of operating lease vehicles, cost of goods sold associated with
  direct sales-type leases and warranty expense related to leased vehicles. Cost of automotive leasing revenue also includes vehicle
  connectivity costs and allocations of electricity and infrastructure costs related to our Supercharger network for vehicles under our
  leasing programs.

        Cost of services and other revenue includes costs associated with providing non-warranty after-sales services and parts, costs
  of paid Supercharging, cost of used vehicles including refurbishment costs, costs for retail merchandise, and costs to provide vehicle
  insurance.

  2022 compared to 2021
        Cost of automotive sales revenue increased $17.18 billion, or 53%, in the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the
  year ended December 31, 2021, in line with the growth in revenue year over year, as discussed above. The average combined cost
  per unit of Model 3 and Model Y increased year over year due to rising raw material, logistics and warranty costs. There were also
  idle capacity charges of $306 million primarily related to the temporary suspension of production at Gigafactory Shanghai as well as
  the ramping up of production in Gigafactory Texas and our proprietary battery cells manufacturing during the year ended December
  31, 2022. We had also incurred costs related to the ramp up of production in Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg during the year ended
  December 31, 2022. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in combined average Model S and Model X costs per unit
  driven by lower average cost for the new versions from ramping up production. Further, these increases in costs of revenue were
  positively impacted by the United States dollar strengthening against other foreign currencies in 2022 compared to the prior period.

        Cost of automotive leasing revenue increased $531 million, or 54%, in the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the
  year ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to an increase in cumulative vehicles under our direct operating lease program and an
  increase in direct sales-type leasing cost of revenues from more activities in the current year.

        Cost of services and other revenue increased $1.97 billion, or 51%, in the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the
  year ended December 31, 2021. The change is primarily due to an increase in used vehicle cost of revenue driven by increases in
  volume and costs of used Tesla and non-Tesla vehicle sales, an increase in non-warranty maintenance service revenue, and an
  increase in costs of paid Supercharging, insurance services and retail merchandise.

        Gross margin for total automotive decreased from 29.3% to 28.5% in the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the
  year ended December 31, 2021. This was driven by the changes in automotive sales revenue and cost of automotive sales revenue,
  partially offset by an increase in regulatory credits revenue, as discussed earlier.

        Gross margin for total automotive & services and other segment decreased from 26.9% to 26.5% in the year ended December
  31, 2022 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to the automotive gross margin decrease discussed above,
  partially offset by an improvement in our services and other gross margin. Additionally, services and other was a higher percentage
  of the segment gross margin during the year ended 2022 as compared to the prior year.

  Energy Generation and Storage Segment
        Cost of energy generation and storage revenue includes direct and indirect material and labor costs, warehouse rent, freight,
  warranty expense, other overhead costs and amortization of certain acquired intangible assets. Cost of energy generation and storage
  revenue also includes charges to write down the carrying value of our inventory when it exceeds its estimated net realizable value
  and to provide for obsolete and on-hand inventory in excess of forecasted demand. In agreements for solar energy system and PPAs
  where we are the lessor, the cost of revenue is primarily comprised of depreciation of the cost of leased solar energy systems,
  maintenance costs associated with those systems and amortization of any initial direct costs.

  2022 compared to 2021
       Cost of energy generation and storage revenue increased $703 million, or 24%, in the year ended December 31, 2022 as
  compared to the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to increases in energy storage deployments of Megapack and
  Powerwall, as well as higher average cost of solar cash and loan deployments due to increased component costs.

        Gross margin for energy generation and storage increased from -4.6% to 7.4% in the year ended December 31, 2022 as
  compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. This was driven by the growth in energy generation and storage revenue and cost of
  energy generation and storage revenue as discussed above. Additionally, there was a higher proportion of energy storage sales, which
  operated at a higher gross margin, within the segment.
                                                                  39

       Research and development (“R&D”) expenses consist primarily of personnel costs for our teams in engineering and research,
  manufacturing engineering and manufacturing test organizations, prototyping expense, contract and professional services and
  amortized equipment expense.

        R&D expenses increased $482 million, or 19%, in the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended
  December 31, 2021. The increase was primarily due to a $175 million increase in employee and labor related expenses, a $132
  million increase in facilities, outside services, freight and depreciation expense, a $101 million increase in R&D expensed materials
  and an $87 million increase in stock-based compensation expense. These increases were to support our expanding product roadmap
  and technologies including our proprietary battery cells. Further, there were additional R&D expenses in the first quarter of 2022 as
  we were in the pre-production phase at Gigafactory Texas and started production at Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg only closer to
  the end of the first quarter of 2022.

        R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased from 5% to 4% in the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the
  year ended December 31, 2021. Our R&D expenses have decreased as a proportion of total revenues despite expanding product
  roadmap and technologies.

        Selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses generally consist of personnel and facilities costs related to our stores,
  marketing, sales, executive, finance, human resources, information technology and legal organizations, as well as fees for
  professional and contract services and litigation settlements.

         SG&A expenses decreased $571 million, or 13%, in the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended
  December 31, 2021. This is primarily due to a decrease of $822 million in stock-based compensation expense, most of which is
  attributable to the lower stock-based compensation expense of $844 million on the 2018 CEO Performance Award. This was
  partially offset by the overall growth in stock-based compensation due to increased headcount. See Note 13, Equity Incentive Plans,
  to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. There was also a decrease of $87
  million in overall employee and labor related expenses driven by a decrease of $340 million of additional payroll tax due to our
  CEO's option exercises from the 2012 CEO Performance Award in 2021, partially offset by an increase in other employee and labor
  costs from increased headcount. These decreases were partially offset by an increase of $222 million in facilities-related expenses,
  and an increase of $117 million in professional services, sales and marketing activities and other costs.

        SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased from 8% to 5% in the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to
  the year ended December 31, 2021. Our SG&A expenses have decreased as a proportion of total revenues due to the decrease in
  expenses as discussed above, in addition to operational efficiencies.

  losses on digital assets, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we also realized gains of $64 million and
  $128 million, respectively, in connection with converting our holdings of digital assets into fiat currency. See Note 3, Digital Assets,
  Net, to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details.
  Additionally, we recorded other expenses of $36 million during the second quarter of the year ended December 31, 2022, related to
  employee terminations.

        Interest income increased $241 million, or 430%, in the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended
  December 31, 2021. This increase was primarily due to higher interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents and short-term
  investments during the year ended 2022 compared to the prior period. This was driven by an increase in our average cash and cash
  equivalents and short-term investments balance and rising interest rates.

  Interest Expense

        Interest expense decreased $180 million, or 49%, in the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended
  December 31, 2021. This decrease was primarily due to the continued reduction in our overall debt balance offset by lower
  capitalized interest. See Note 11, Debt, to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form
  10-K for further details.

         Other (expense) income, net, consists primarily of foreign exchange gains and losses related to our foreign currency-
  denominated monetary assets and liabilities. We expect our foreign exchange gains and losses will vary depending upon movements
  in the underlying exchange rates.

        Other (expense) income, net, changed unfavorably by $178 million in the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the
  year ended December 31, 2021. The change is primarily due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.

        Our provision for income taxes increased by $433 million, or 62%, in the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the
  year ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to the increase in our pre-tax income year over year.

      Our effective tax rate decreased from 11% to 8% in the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended
  December 31, 2021, primarily due to changes in mix of jurisdictional earnings.

         Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests decreased by $94 million, or 75%,
  in the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. These changes were due to a decrease in
  allocations to financing fund investors.

  Liquidity and Capital Resources
         We expect to continue to generate net positive operating cash flow as we have done in the last four fiscal years. The cash we
  generate from our core operations enables us to fund ongoing operations and production, our research and development projects for
  new products and technologies including our proprietary battery cells, additional manufacturing ramps at existing manufacturing
  facilities such as the Fremont Factory, Gigafactory Nevada, Gigafactory Shanghai and Gigafactory New York, the ramp of
  Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg and Gigafactory Texas and the continued expansion of our retail and service locations, body shops,
  Mobile Service fleet, Supercharger network and energy product installation capabilities.

         In addition, because a large portion of our future expenditures will be to fund our growth, we expect that if needed we will be
  able to adjust our capital and operating expenditures by operating segment. For example, if our near-term manufacturing operations
  decrease in scale or ramp more slowly than expected, including due to global economic or business conditions, we may choose to
  correspondingly slow the pace of our capital expenditures. Finally, we continually evaluate our cash needs and may decide it is best
  to raise additional capital or seek alternative financing sources to fund the rapid growth of our business, including through
  drawdowns on existing or new debt facilities or financing funds. Conversely, we may also from time to time determine that it is in
  our best interests to voluntarily repay certain indebtedness early.

        Accordingly, we believe that our current sources of funds will provide us with adequate liquidity during the 12-month period
  following December 31, 2022, as well as in the long-term.

        See the sections below for more details regarding the material requirements for cash in our business and our sources of
  liquidity to meet such needs.

  Material Cash Requirements
        From time to time in the ordinary course of business, we enter into agreements with vendors for the purchase of components
  and raw materials to be used in the manufacture of our products. However, due to contractual terms, variability in the precise growth
  curves of our development and production ramps, and opportunities to renegotiate pricing, we generally do not have binding and
  enforceable purchase orders under such contracts beyond the short-term, and the timing and magnitude of purchase orders beyond
  such period is difficult to accurately project.

        As discussed in and subject to the considerations referenced in Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of
  Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Management Opportunities, Challenges and Risks and 2023 Outlook—Cash Flow
  and Capital Expenditure Trends in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we currently expect our capital expenditures to support our
  projects globally to be between $6.00 to $8.00 billion in 2023 and between $7.00 to $9.00 billion in each of the following two fiscal
  years. In connection with our operations at Gigafactory New York, we have an agreement to spend or incur $5.00 billion in
  combined capital, operational expenses, costs of goods sold and other costs in the State of New York through December 31, 2029
  (pursuant to a deferral of our required timelines to meet such obligations that was granted in April 2021, and which was
  memorialized in an amendment to our agreement with the SUNY Foundation in August 2021). We also have an operating lease
  arrangement with the local government of Shanghai pursuant to which we are required to spend RMB 14.08 billion in capital
  expenditures at Gigafactory Shanghai by the end of 2023. For details regarding these obligations, refer to Note 15, Commitments
  and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

        As of December 31, 2022, we and our subsidiaries had outstanding $2.06 billion in aggregate principal amount of
  indebtedness, of which $1.02 billion is scheduled to become due in the succeeding 12 months. As of December 31, 2022, our total
  minimum lease payments was $4.28 billion, of which $1.14 billion is due in the succeeding 12 months. For details regarding our
  indebtedness and lease obligations, refer to Note 11, Debt, and Note 12, Leases, to the consolidated financial statements included
  elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

  Sources and Conditions of Liquidity
        Our sources to fund our material cash requirements are predominantly from our deliveries and servicing of new and used
  vehicles, sales and installations of our energy storage products and solar energy systems, proceeds from debt facilities and proceeds
  from equity offerings, when applicable.
                                                                     42

         As of December 31, 2022, we had $16.25 billion and $5.93 billion of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments,
  respectively. Balances held in foreign currencies had a U.S. dollar equivalent of $3.42 billion and consisted primarily of Chinese
  yuan, euros and British pounds. In addition, we had $2.42 billion of unused committed amounts under our credit facilities as of
  December 31, 2022, which included $2.27 billion under our Credit Agreement which was terminated in January 2023. Certain of
  such unused committed amounts are subject to satisfying specified conditions prior to draw-down (such as pledging to our lenders
  sufficient amounts of qualified receivables, inventories, leased vehicles and our interests in those leases, solar energy systems and
  the associated customer contracts or various other assets). In January 2023, we entered into an unsecured revolving credit facility
  providing for a commitment of up to $5.0 billion. For details regarding our indebtedness, refer to Note 11, Debt, to the consolidated
  financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

        We continue adapting our strategy to meet our liquidity and risk objectives, such as investing in U.S. government and other
  investments, to do more vertical integration, expand our product roadmap and provide financing options to our customers.

  Cash Flows from Operating Activities
        Our cash flows from operating activities are significantly affected by our cash investments to support the growth of our
  business in areas such as research and development and selling, general and administrative and working capital. Our operating cash
  inflows include cash from vehicle sales and related servicing, customer lease and financing payments, customer deposits, cash from
  sales of regulatory credits and energy generation and storage products. These cash inflows are offset by our payments to suppliers
  for production materials and parts used in our manufacturing process, operating expenses, operating lease payments and interest
  payments on our financings.

         Net cash provided by operating activities increased by $3.23 billion to $14.72 billion during the year ended December 31,
  2022 from $11.50 billion during the year ended December 31, 2021. This increase was primarily due to the increase in net income
  excluding non-cash expenses, gains and losses of $7.65 billion, offset by the overall increase in net operating assets and liabilities of
  $4.43 billion. The increase in our net operating assets and liabilities was mainly driven by a larger increase of inventory in the year
  ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021, partially offset by a larger increase of accounts
  payable and accrued liabilities, to support the ramp up in production at our factories and larger increases in other non-current assets
  and prepaid expenses and other current assets. Additionally, the increase in our net operating assets and other liabilities was partially
  offset by a larger increase in other long-term liabilities as compared to the prior year.

  Cash Flows from Investing Activities
        Cash flows from investing activities and their variability across each period related primarily to capital expenditures, which
  were $7.16 billion for the year ended December 31, 2022 and $6.48 billion for the year ended December 31, 2021, mainly for the
  expansions of Gigafactory Texas, the Fremont Factory, Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg, and Gigafactory Shanghai. We also
  purchased $5.84 billion of investments in the year ended December 31, 2022. Additionally, cash inflows related to sales of digital
  assets were $936 million in the year ended December 31, 2022, and net cash outflows related to digital assets were $1.23 billion in
  the year ended December 31, 2021 from purchases of digital assets for $1.50 billion offset by proceeds from sales of digital assets of
  $272 million.

  Cash Flows from Financing Activities
        Net cash used in financing activities decreased by $1.68 billion to $3.53 billion during the year ended December 31, 2022
  from $5.20 billion during the year ended December 31, 2021. The decrease was primarily due to a $1.92 billion decrease in
  repayments of convertible and other debt, net of proceeds from issuances of debt. See Note 11, Debt, to the consolidated financial
  statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details regarding our debt obligations.

  ITEM 7A.         QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
  Foreign Currency Risk
        We transact business globally in multiple currencies and hence have foreign currency risks related to our revenue, costs of
  revenue, operating expenses and localized subsidiary debt denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar (primarily the
  Chinese yuan, euro, pound sterling and Norwegian krone in relation to our current year operations). In general, we are a net receiver
  of currencies other than the U.S. dollar for our foreign subsidiaries. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates affect our revenue and
  other operating results as expressed in U.S. dollars as we do not typically hedge foreign currency risk.

        We have also experienced, and will continue to experience, fluctuations in our net income as a result of gains (losses) on the
  settlement and the re-measurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies that are not the local currency
  (primarily consisting of our intercompany and cash and cash equivalents balances).

        We considered the historical trends in foreign currency exchange rates and determined that it is reasonably possible that
  adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates of 10% for all currencies could be experienced in the near-term. These changes
  were applied to our total monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than our local currencies at the balance
  sheet date to compute the impact these changes would have had on our net income before income taxes. These changes would have
  resulted in a gain or loss of $473 million at December 31, 2022 and $277 million at December 31, 2021, assuming no foreign
  currency hedging.

                                       Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

  To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Tesla, Inc.

  Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting

  We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Tesla, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December
  31, 2022 and 2021, and the related consolidated statements of operations, of comprehensive income, of redeemable noncontrolling
  interests and equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, including the related notes
  (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the Company's internal control over
  financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued
  by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

  In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
  the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the
  period ended December 31, 2022 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also
  in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December
  31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.

  Changes in Accounting Principles

  As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for
  convertible debt in 2021.

  Basis for Opinions

  The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control
  over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in
  Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express
  opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based
  on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)
  (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and
  the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

  We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the
  audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether
  due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.

  Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of
  the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such
  procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial
  statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as
  well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial
  reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness
  exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits
  also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide
  a reasonable basis for our opinions.

  Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting

  A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
  of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
  accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to
  the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
  company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements
  in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only
  in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding
  prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material
  effect on the financial statements.

                                                                      46




https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000095017023001409/tsla-20221231.htm                                                     47/115
25/04/23, 17:14                                                               10-K


  Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,
  projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because
  of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

  Critical Audit Matters

  The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial
  statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or
  disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or
  complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial
  statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the
  critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.

  Automotive Warranty Reserve

  As described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, total accrued warranty, which primarily relates to the automotive
  segment, was $3,505 million as of December 31, 2022. The Company provides a manufacturer’s warranty on all new and used Tesla
  vehicles. A warranty reserve is accrued for these products sold, which includes management’s best estimate of the projected costs to
  repair or replace items under warranty and recalls if identified. These estimates are based on actual claims incurred to date and an
  estimate of the nature, frequency and costs of future claims.

  The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the automotive warranty reserve is a
  critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management in determining the automotive warranty reserve for certain Tesla
  vehicle models; this in turn led to significant auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures to evaluate
  management’s significant assumptions related to the nature, frequency and costs of future claims for certain Tesla vehicle models,
  and the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.

  Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion
  on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management’s
  estimate of the automotive warranty reserve for certain Tesla vehicle models, including controls over management’s significant
  assumptions related to the nature, frequency and costs of future claims as well as the completeness and accuracy of actual claims
  incurred to date. These procedures also included, among others, performing one of the following: (i) testing management’s process
  for determining the automotive warranty reserve for certain Tesla vehicle models or (ii) developing an independent estimate of the
  automotive warranty reserve for certain Tesla vehicle models and comparing the independent estimate to management’s estimate to
  evaluate the reasonableness of the estimate. Testing management’s process involved evaluating the reasonableness of significant
  assumptions related to the nature and frequency of future claims and the related costs to repair or replace items under warranty.
  Evaluating the assumptions related to the nature and frequency of future claims and the related costs to repair or replace items under
  warranty involved evaluating whether the assumptions used were reasonable by performing a lookback analysis comparing prior
  period forecasted claims to actual claims incurred. Developing the independent estimate involved testing the completeness and
  accuracy of historical vehicle claims processed and testing that such claims were appropriately used by management in the
  estimation of future claims. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in developing an independent
  estimate of the automotive warranty reserve for certain Tesla vehicle models and in evaluating the appropriateness of certain aspects
  of management’s significant assumptions related to the nature and frequency of future claims.

                                              Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

  Note 1 – Overview
         Tesla, Inc. (“Tesla”, the “Company”, “we”, “us” or “our”) was incorporated in the State of Delaware on July 1, 2003. We
  design, develop, manufacture, sell and lease high-performance fully electric vehicles and energy generation and storage systems, and
  offer services related to our products. Our Chief Executive Officer, as the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”), organizes our
  company, manages resource allocations and measures performance among two operating and reportable segments: (i) automotive
  and (ii) energy generation and storage.

         Since the first quarter of 2020, there has been a worldwide impact from the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as an easing of
  restrictions on social, business, travel and government activities and functions. There are ongoing global impacts resulting from the
  pandemic, and we have been affected by temporary manufacturing closures, employment and compensation adjustments and
  impediments to administrative activities supporting our product deliveries and deployments. In addition, we have experienced and
  are experiencing the impacts of varying levels of inflation caused by the COVID‐19 pandemic and general global economic
  conditions.

        On August 5, 2022, we increased the number of authorized shares of common stock by 4,000,000,000 shares and our Board of
  Directors declared the 2022 Stock Split. Each stockholder of record on August 17, 2022 received a dividend of two additional shares
  of common stock for each then-held share, distributed after close of trading on August 24, 2022. All share and per share amounts
  presented herein have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the impact of the 2022 Stock Split.

  Note 2 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
  Principles of Consolidation
        The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with GAAP and reflect our accounts
  and operations and those of our subsidiaries in which we have a controlling financial interest. In accordance with the provisions of
  ASC 810, Consolidation (“ASC 810”), we consolidate any variable interest entity (“VIE”) of which we are the primary beneficiary.
  We have formed VIEs with financing fund investors in the ordinary course of business in order to facilitate the funding and
  monetization of certain attributes associated with solar energy systems and leases under our direct vehicle leasing programs. The
  typical condition for a controlling financial interest ownership is holding a majority of the voting interests of an entity; however, a
  controlling financial interest may also exist in entities, such as VIEs, through arrangements that do not involve controlling voting
  interests. ASC 810 requires a variable interest holder to consolidate a VIE if that party has the power to direct the activities of the
  VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE that could
  potentially be significant to the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. We
  do not consolidate a VIE in which we have a majority ownership interest when we are not considered the primary beneficiary. We
  have determined that we are the primary beneficiary of all the VIEs (see Note 16, Variable Interest Entity Arrangements). We
  evaluate our relationships with all the VIEs on an ongoing basis to ensure that we continue to be the primary beneficiary. All
  intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated upon consolidation.

  Use of Estimates
         The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions
  that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses and related disclosures in the accompanying notes.
  The estimates used for, but not limited to, determining significant economic incentive for resale value guarantee arrangements, sales
  return reserves, the collectability of accounts and finance receivables, inventory valuation, warranties, fair value of long-lived assets,
  goodwill, fair value of financial instruments, fair value and residual value of operating lease vehicles and solar energy systems
  subject to leases could be impacted. We have assessed the impact and are not aware of any specific events or circumstances that
  required an update to our estimates and assumptions or materially affected the carrying value of our assets or liabilities as of the date
  of issuance of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These estimates may change as new events occur and additional information is
  obtained. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

  Reclassifications
        Certain prior period balances have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation in the consolidated financial
  statements and the accompanying notes.
                                                                    53

  Revenue Recognition
        Revenue by source
        The following table disaggregates our revenue by major source (in millions):

                                                                                                  Year Ended December 31,

  (1)   Pricing adjustments on our vehicle offerings can impact the estimate of likelihood that customers would exercise their resale
        value guarantees, resulting in an adjustment of our sales return reserve on vehicles sold with resale value guarantees. Actual
        return rates being lower than expected and increases in resale values of our vehicles in 2021 resulted in a net release of our
        reserve of $365 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, which represented increases in automotive sales revenue. The
        net release or increase of reserves which impacted automotive sales revenue were immaterial for the years ended December
        31, 2022 and December 31, 2020. Further, $324 million of the total revenue recognized as of December 31, 2022 is related to
        the general FSD feature release in North America in the fourth quarter of 2022.

        Automotive Segment
        Automotive Sales
         Automotive sales revenue includes revenues related to cash and financing deliveries of new vehicles, and specific other
  features and services that meet the definition of a performance obligation under ASC 606, including access to our FSD features,
  internet connectivity, Supercharger network and over-the-air software updates. We recognize revenue on automotive sales upon
  delivery to the customer, which is when the control of a vehicle transfers. Payments are typically received at the point control
  transfers or in accordance with payment terms customary to the business, except sales we finance for which payments are collected
  over the contractual loan term. We also recognize a sales return reserve based on historical experience plus consideration for
  expected future market values, when we offer resale value guarantees or similar buyback terms. Other features and services such as
  access to our internet connectivity, legacy programs offering unlimited free Supercharging and over-the-air software updates are
  provisioned upon control transfer of a vehicle and recognized over time on a straight-line basis as we have a stand-ready obligation
  to deliver such services to the customer. Other limited free Supercharging incentives are recognized based on actual usage or
  expiration, whichever is earlier. We recognize revenue related to these other features and services over the performance period,
  which is generally the expected ownership life of the vehicle. Revenue related to FSD is recognized when functionality is delivered
  to the customer and the portion related to software updates is recognized over time. For our obligations related to automotive sales,
  we estimate standalone selling price by considering costs used to develop and deliver the service, third-party pricing of similar
  options and other information that may be available.

        Any fees that are paid or payable by us to a customer’s lender when we arrange the financing are recognized as an offset
  against automotive sales revenue. Costs to obtain a contract mainly relate to commissions paid to our sales personnel for the sale of
  vehicles. As our contract costs related to automotive sales are typically fulfilled within one year, the costs to obtain a contract are
  expensed as incurred. Amounts billed to customers related to shipping and handling are classified as automotive sales revenue, and
  we have elected to recognize the cost for freight and shipping when control over vehicles, parts or accessories have transferred to the
  customer as an expense in cost of automotive sales revenue. Our policy is to exclude taxes collected from a customer from the
  transaction price of automotive contracts.
                                                                     54




https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000095017023001409/tsla-20221231.htm                                                   55/115
25/04/23, 17:14                                                               10-K



         We offer resale value guarantees or similar buy-back terms to certain international customers who purchase vehicles and who
  finance their vehicles through one of our specified commercial banking partners. Under these programs, we receive full payment for
  the vehicle sales price at the time of delivery and our counterparty has the option of selling their vehicle back to us during the
  guarantee period, which currently is generally at the end of the term of the applicable loan or financing program, for a pre-
  determined resale value. We account for such automotive sales as a sale with a right of return when we do not believe the customer
  has a significant economic incentive to exercise the resale value guarantee provided to them at contract inception. The process to
  determine whether there is a significant economic incentive includes a comparison of a vehicle’s estimated market value at the time
  the option is exercisable with the guaranteed resale value to determine the customer’s economic incentive to exercise. On a quarterly
  basis, we assess the estimated market values of vehicles sold with resale value guarantees to determine whether there have been
  changes to the likelihood of future product returns. As we accumulate more data related to the resale values of our vehicles or as
  market conditions change, there may be material changes to their estimated values. The total sales return reserve on vehicles sold
  with resale value guarantees was $91 million and $223 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, of which $40
  million and $91 million was short-term, respectively.

       Deferred revenue related to the access to our FSD features, internet connectivity, free Supercharging programs and over-the-air
  software updates primarily on automotive sales consisted of the following (in millions):

                                                                                                    Year ended December 31,
                                                                                                2022                      2021
  Deferred revenue— beginning of period                                                $               2,382     $               1,926
  Additions                                                                                            1,178                       847
  Net changes in liability for pre-existing contracts                                                    (67 )                     (25 )
  Revenue recognized                                                                                    (580 )                    (366 )
  Deferred revenue— end of period                                                      $               2,913     $               2,382

        Deferred revenue is equivalent to the total transaction price allocated to the performance obligations that are unsatisfied, or
  partially unsatisfied, as of the balance sheet date. Revenue recognized from the deferred revenue balance as of December 31, 2021
  was $472 million as of December 31, 2022, primarily related to the general FSD feature release in North America in the fourth
  quarter of 2022. We had recognized revenue of $312 million from the deferred revenue balance as of December 31, 2020, for the
  year ended December 31, 2021. Of the total deferred revenue balance as of December 31, 2022, we expect to recognize $639 million
  of revenue in the next 12 months. The remaining balance will be recognized at the time of transfer of control of the product or over
  the performance period as discussed above in Automotive Sales.

         We have been providing loans for financing our automotive deliveries during the year ended December 31, 2022. We have
  recorded net financing receivables on the consolidated balance sheets, of which $128 million is recorded within Accounts receivable,
  net, for the current portion and $665 million is recorded within Other non-current assets for the long-term portion, as of December
  31, 2022.

        Automotive Regulatory Credits
        We earn tradable credits in the operation of our automotive business under various regulations related to ZEVs, greenhouse
  gas, fuel economy and clean fuel. We sell these credits to other regulated entities who can use the credits to comply with emission
  standards and other regulatory requirements.

         Payments for automotive regulatory credits are typically received at the point control transfers to the customer, or in
  accordance with payment terms customary to the business. We recognize revenue on the sale of automotive regulatory credits, which
  have negligible incremental costs associated with them, at the time control of the regulatory credits is transferred to the purchasing
  party. Deferred revenue related to sales of automotive regulatory credits was immaterial as of December 31, 2022 and 2021.
  Revenue recognized from the deferred revenue balance as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 was immaterial for the years ended
  December 31, 2022 and 2021. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we had also recognized $288 million in revenue due to
  changes in regulation which entitled us to additional consideration for credits sold previously.
                                                                    55

        Automotive Leasing Revenue
        Direct Vehicle Operating Leasing Program
         We have outstanding leases under our direct vehicle operating leasing programs in the U.S., Canada and in certain countries in
  Europe. Qualifying customers are permitted to lease a vehicle directly from Tesla for up to 48 months. At the end of the lease term,
  customers are generally required to return the vehicles to us. We account for these leasing transactions as operating leases. We record
  leasing revenues to automotive leasing revenue on a straight-line basis over the contractual term, and we record the depreciation of
  these vehicles to cost of automotive leasing revenue. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, we recognized $1.75
  billion, $1.25 billion and $752 million of direct vehicle leasing revenue, respectively. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had
  deferred $407 million and $392 million, respectively, of lease-related upfront payments, which will be recognized on a straight-line
  basis over the contractual terms of the individual leases.

        Our policy is to exclude taxes collected from a customer from the transaction price of automotive contracts.

        Direct Sales-Type Leasing Program
         We have outstanding direct leases and vehicles financed by us under loan arrangements accounted for as sales-type leases
  under ASC 842, Leases (“ASC 842”), in certain countries in Asia and Europe. Depending on the specific program, customers may or
  may not have a right to return the vehicle to us during or at the end of the lease term. If the customer does not have a right to return,
  the customer will take title to the vehicle at the end of the lease term after making all contractual payments. Under the programs for
  which there is a right to return, the purchase option is reasonably certain to be exercised by the lessee and we therefore expect the
  customer to take title to the vehicle at the end of the lease term after making all contractual payments. Our arrangements under these
  programs can have terms for up to 72 months. We recognize all revenue and costs associated with the sales-type lease as automotive
  leasing revenue and automotive leasing cost of revenue, respectively, upon delivery of the vehicle to the customer. Interest income
  based on the implicit rate in the lease is recorded to automotive leasing revenue over time as customers are invoiced on a monthly
  basis. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, we recognized $683 million, $369 million and $120 million,
  respectively, of sales-type leasing revenue and $427 million, $234 million and $87 million, respectively, of sales-type leasing cost of
  revenue.

        Services and Other Revenue
       Services and other revenue consists of non-warranty after-sales vehicle services and parts, sales of used vehicles, paid
  Supercharging, retail merchandise and vehicle insurance revenue.

        Revenues related to repair and maintenance services are recognized over time as services are provided and extended service
  plans are recognized over the performance period of the service contract as the obligation represents a stand-ready obligation to the
  customer. We sell used vehicles, services, service plans, vehicle components and merchandise separately and thus use standalone
  selling prices as the basis for revenue allocation to the extent that these items are sold in transactions with other performance
  obligations. Payment for used vehicles, services, and merchandise are typically received at the point when control transfers to the
  customer or in accordance with payment terms customary to the business. Payments received for prepaid plans are refundable upon
  customer cancellation of the related contracts and are included within Customer deposits on the consolidated balance sheets.
  Deferred revenue related to services and other revenue was immaterial as of December 31, 2022 and 2021.

        Energy Generation and Storage Segment
        Energy Generation and Storage Sales
         Energy generation and storage sales revenue consists of the sale of solar energy systems and energy storage systems to
  residential, small commercial, large commercial and utility grade customers. Sales of solar energy systems to residential and small
  scale commercial customers consist of the engineering, design and installation of the system. Residential and small scale commercial
  customers pay the full purchase price of the solar energy system upfront. Revenue for the design and installation obligation is
  recognized when control transfers, which is when we install a solar energy system and the system passes inspection by the utility or
  the authority having jurisdiction. Sales of energy storage systems to residential and small scale commercial customers consist of the
  installation of the energy storage system and revenue is recognized when control transfers, which is when the product has been
  delivered or, if we are performing installation, when installed and commissioned. Payment for such storage systems is made upon
  invoice or in accordance with payment terms customary to the business.

        For large commercial and utility grade solar energy system and energy storage system sales which consist of the engineering,
  design and installation of the system, customers make milestone payments that are consistent with contract-specific phases of a
  project. Revenue from such contracts is recognized over time using the percentage of completion method based on cost incurred as a
  percentage of total estimated contract costs for energy storage system sales and as a percentage of total estimated labor hours for
  solar energy system sales.
                                                                     56

        In instances where there are multiple performance obligations in a single contract, we allocate the consideration to the various
  obligations in the contract based on the relative standalone selling price method. Standalone selling prices are estimated based on
  estimated costs plus margin or by using market data for comparable products. Costs incurred on the sale of residential installations
  before the solar energy systems are completed are included as work in process within inventory in the consolidated balance sheets.
  Any fees that are paid or payable by us to a solar loan lender would be recognized as an offset against revenue. Costs to obtain a
  contract relate mainly to commissions paid to our sales personnel related to the sale of solar energy systems and energy storage
  systems. As our contract costs related to solar energy system and energy storage system sales are typically fulfilled within one year,
  the costs to obtain a contract are expensed as incurred.

        As part of our solar energy system and energy storage system contracts, we may provide the customer with performance
  guarantees that warrant that the underlying system will meet or exceed the minimum energy generation or energy performance
  requirements specified in the contract. In certain instances, we may receive a bonus payment if the system performs above a
  specified level. Conversely, if a solar energy system or energy storage system does not meet the performance guarantee
  requirements, we may be required to pay liquidated damages. Other forms of variable consideration related to our large commercial
  and utility grade solar energy system and energy storage system contracts include variable customer payments that will be made
  based on our energy market participation activities. Such guarantees and variable customer payments represent a form of variable
  consideration and are estimated at contract inception at their most likely amount and updated at the end of each reporting period as
  additional performance data becomes available. Such estimates are included in the transaction price only to the extent that it is
  probable a significant reversal of revenue will not occur.

        We record as deferred revenue any non-refundable amounts that are collected from customers related to fees charged for
  prepayments, which is recognized as revenue ratably over the respective customer contract term. As of December 31, 2022 and
  2021, deferred revenue related to such customer payments amounted to $863 million and $399 million, respectively, mainly due to
  milestone payments. Revenue recognized from the deferred revenue balance as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 was $171 million
  and $93 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. We have elected the practical expedient to omit
  disclosure of the amount of the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations for energy generation and storage
  sales with an original expected contract length of one year or less and the amount that we have the right to invoice when that amount
  corresponds directly with the value of the performance to date. As of December 31, 2022, total transaction price allocated to
  performance obligations that were unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied for contracts with an original expected length of more than one
  year was $210 million. Of this amount, we expect to recognize $12 million in the next 12 months and the remaining over a period up
  to 25 years.

        We have been providing loans for financing our energy generation products during the year ended December 31, 2022. We
  have recorded net financing receivables on the consolidated balance sheets, of which $24 million is recorded within Accounts
  receivable, net, for the current portion and $387 million is recorded within Other non-current assets for the long-term portion, as of
  December 31, 2022.

        Energy Generation and Storage Leasing
        For revenue arrangements where we are the lessor under operating lease agreements for energy generation and storage
  products, we record lease revenue from minimum lease payments, including upfront rebates and incentives earned from such
  systems, on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease term, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. The
  difference between the payments received and the revenue recognized is recorded as deferred revenue or deferred asset on the
  consolidated balance sheet.

        For solar energy systems where customers purchase electricity from us under PPAs prior to January 1, 2019, we have
  determined that these agreements should be accounted for as operating leases pursuant to ASC 840, Leases. Revenue is recognized
  based on the amount of electricity delivered at rates specified under the contracts, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are
  met.

        We record as deferred revenue any amounts that are collected from customers, including lease prepayments, in excess of
  revenue recognized, which is recognized as revenue ratably over the respective customer contract term. As of December 31, 2022
  and 2021, deferred revenue related to such customer payments amounted to $191 million and $198 million, respectively. Deferred
  revenue also includes the portion of rebates and incentives received from utility companies and various local and state government
  agencies, which is recognized as revenue over the lease term. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, deferred revenue from rebates and
  incentives amounted to $25 million and $27 million, respectively.

        We capitalize initial direct costs from the execution of agreements for solar energy systems and PPAs, which include the
  referral fees and sales commissions, as an element of solar energy systems, net, and subsequently amortize these costs over the term
  of the related agreements.
                                                                     57

  Cost of Revenues
        Automotive Segment
        Automotive Sales
        Cost of automotive sales revenue includes direct and indirect materials, labor costs, manufacturing overhead, including
  depreciation costs of tooling and machinery, shipping and logistic costs, vehicle connectivity costs, allocations of electricity and
  infrastructure costs related to our Supercharger network and reserves for estimated warranty expenses. Cost of automotive sales
  revenues also includes adjustments to warranty expense and charges to write down the carrying value of our inventory when it
  exceeds its estimated net realizable value and to provide for obsolete and on-hand inventory in excess of forecasted demand.

        Automotive Leasing
         Cost of automotive leasing revenue includes the depreciation of operating lease vehicles, cost of goods sold associated with
  direct sales-type leases and warranty expense related to leased vehicles. Cost of automotive leasing revenue also includes vehicle
  connectivity costs and allocations of electricity and infrastructure costs related to our Supercharger network for vehicles under our
  leasing programs.

        Services and Other
        Costs of services and other revenue includes costs associated with providing non-warranty after-sales services and parts, costs
  of paid Supercharging, cost of used vehicles including refurbishment costs, costs for retail merchandise, and costs to provide vehicle
  insurance.

        Energy Generation and Storage Segment
        Energy Generation and Storage
        Cost of energy generation and storage revenue includes direct and indirect material and labor costs, warehouse rent, freight,
  warranty expense, other overhead costs and amortization of certain acquired intangible assets. Cost of energy generation and storage
  revenue also includes charges to write down the carrying value of our inventory when it exceeds its estimated net realizable value
  and to provide for obsolete and on-hand inventory in excess of forecasted demand. In agreements for solar energy systems and PPAs
  where we are the lessor, the cost of revenue is primarily comprised of depreciation of the cost of leased solar energy systems,
  maintenance costs associated with those systems and amortization of any initial direct costs.

  Research and Development Costs
        Research and development costs are expensed as incurred.

  Income Taxes
        Income taxes are computed using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined
  based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the
  year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce
  deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.

        We record liabilities related to uncertain tax positions when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are supportable, we
  believe that it is more likely than not that those positions may not be fully sustained upon review by tax authorities. Accrued interest
  and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are classified as income tax expense.

        The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“TCJA”) subjects a U.S. shareholder to tax on global intangible low-taxed income (“GILTI”)
  earned by certain foreign subsidiaries. Under GAAP, we can make an accounting policy election to either treat taxes due on the
  GILTI inclusion as a current period expense or factor such amounts into our measurement of deferred taxes. We elected the deferred
  method, under which we recorded the corresponding deferred tax assets and liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets, currently
  subject to valuation allowance.

  Comprehensive Income
       Comprehensive income is comprised of net income and other comprehensive (loss) income. Other comprehensive (loss)
  income consists of foreign currency translation adjustments and unrealized net gains and losses on investments that have been
  excluded from the determination of net income.
                                                                   58

  Stock-Based Compensation
         We use the fair value method of accounting for our stock options and RSUs granted to employees and for our ESPP to measure
  the cost of employee services received in exchange for the stock-based awards. The fair value of stock option awards with only
  service and/or performance conditions is estimated on the grant or offering date using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The
  Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires inputs such as the risk-free interest rate, expected term and expected volatility. These
  inputs are subjective and generally require significant judgment. The fair value of RSUs is measured on the grant date based on the
  closing fair market value of our common stock. The resulting cost is recognized over the period during which an employee is
  required to provide service in exchange for the awards, usually the vesting period, which is generally four years for stock options
  and RSUs and six months for the ESPP. Stock-based compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis, net of actual
  forfeitures in the period.

        For performance-based awards, stock-based compensation expense is recognized over the expected performance achievement
  period of individual performance milestones when the achievement of each individual performance milestone becomes probable.

        As we accumulate additional employee stock-based awards data over time and as we incorporate market data related to our
  common stock, we may calculate significantly different volatilities and expected lives, which could materially impact the valuation
  of our stock-based awards and the stock-based compensation expense that we will recognize in future periods. Stock-based
  compensation expense is recorded in Cost of revenues, Research and development expense and Selling, general and administrative
  expense in the consolidated statements of operations.

  Noncontrolling Interests and Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests
         Noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests represent third-party interests in the net assets under certain
  funding arrangements, or funds, that we have entered into to finance the costs of solar energy systems and vehicles under operating
  leases. We have determined that the contractual provisions of the funds represent substantive profit-sharing arrangements. We have
  further determined that the methodology for calculating the noncontrolling interest and redeemable noncontrolling interest balances
  that reflects the substantive profit-sharing arrangements is a balance sheet approach using the hypothetical liquidation at book value
  (“HLBV”) method. We, therefore, determine the amount of the noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests in
  the net assets of the funds at each balance sheet date using the HLBV method, which is presented on the consolidated balance sheet
  as noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries and redeemable noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries. Under the HLBV method, the
  amounts reported as noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests in the consolidated balance sheet represent the
  amounts the third parties would hypothetically receive at each balance sheet date under the liquidation provisions of the funds,
  assuming the net assets of the funds were liquidated at their recorded amounts determined in accordance with GAAP and with tax
  laws effective at the balance sheet date and distributed to the third parties. The third parties’ interests in the results of operations of
  the funds are determined as the difference in the noncontrolling interest and redeemable noncontrolling interest balances in the
  consolidated balance sheets between the start and end of each reporting period, after taking into account any capital transactions
  between the funds and the third parties. However, the redeemable noncontrolling interest balance is at least equal to the redemption
  amount. The redeemable noncontrolling interest balance is presented as temporary equity in the mezzanine section of the
  consolidated balance sheet since these third parties have the right to redeem their interests in the funds for cash or other assets. For
  certain funds, there may be significant fluctuations in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable
  noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries due to changes in the liquidation provisions as time-based milestones are reached.

  Net Income per Share of Common Stock Attributable to Common Stockholders
         Basic net income per share of common stock attributable to common stockholders is calculated by dividing net income
  attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-average shares of common stock outstanding for the period. Potentially
  dilutive shares, which are based on the weighted-average shares of common stock underlying outstanding stock-based awards,
  warrants and convertible senior notes using the treasury stock method or the if-converted method, as applicable, are included when
  calculating diluted net income per share of common stock attributable to common stockholders when their effect is dilutive.

        Furthermore, in connection with the offerings of our convertible senior notes, we entered into convertible note hedges and
  warrants (see Note 11, Debt). However, our convertible note hedges are not included when calculating potentially dilutive shares
  since their effect is always anti-dilutive. The strike price on the warrants were below our average share price during the period and
  were included in the tables below. Warrants are included in the weighted-average shares used in computing basic net income per
  share of common stock in the period(s) they are settled.

                                                                      59

  Business Combinations
         We account for business acquisitions under ASC 805, Business Combinations. The total purchase consideration for an
  acquisition is measured as the fair value of the assets given, equity instruments issued and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date.
  Costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition are expensed as incurred. Identifiable assets (including intangible assets),
  liabilities assumed (including contingent liabilities) and noncontrolling interests in an acquisition are measured initially at their fair
  values at the acquisition date. We recognize goodwill if the fair value of the total purchase consideration and any noncontrolling
  interests is in excess of the net fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. We recognize a bargain
  purchase gain within Other (expense) income, net, in the consolidated statement of operations if the net fair value of the identifiable
  assets acquired and the liabilities assumed is in excess of the fair value of the total purchase consideration and any noncontrolling
  interests. We include the results of operations of the acquired business in the consolidated financial statements beginning on the
  acquisition date.

  Cash and Cash Equivalents
       All highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase are considered cash
  equivalents. Our cash equivalents are primarily comprised of money market funds and certificates of deposit.
                                                                   60

  Restricted Cash
        We maintain certain cash balances restricted as to withdrawal or use. Our restricted cash is comprised primarily of cash held to
  service certain payments under various secured debt facilities. In addition, restricted cash includes cash held as collateral for certain
  permits as well as sales to lease partners with a resale value guarantee, letters of credit, real estate leases, deposits held for our
  insurance services and certain operating leases. We record restricted cash as other assets in the consolidated balance sheets and
  determine current or non-current classification based on the expected duration of the restriction.

        Our total cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash, as presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows, was as
  follows (in millions):

                                                                             December 31,           December 31,           December 31,

  Investments
         Investments may be comprised of a combination of marketable securities, including U.S. government securities, corporate debt
  securities, time deposit, and certain certificates of deposit, which are all designated as available-for-sale and reported at estimated
  fair value, with unrealized gains and losses recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income which is included within
  stockholders’ equity. Available-for-sale marketable securities with maturities greater than three months at the date of purchase are
  included in short-term investments in our consolidated balance sheets. Interest, dividends, amortization and accretion of purchase
  premiums and discounts on these investments are included within Interest income in our consolidated statements of operations.

        The cost of available-for-sale investments sold is based on the specific identification method. Realized gains and losses on the
  sale of available-for-sale investments are recorded in Other (expense) income, net.

        We regularly review all of our investments for declines in fair value. The review includes but is not limited to (i) the
  consideration of the cause of the decline, (ii) any currently recorded expected credit losses and (iii) the creditworthiness of the
  respective security issuers. The amortized cost basis of our investments approximates its fair value.

  Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
        Accounts receivable primarily include amounts related to receivables from financial institutions and leasing companies
  offering various financing products to our customers, sales of energy generation and storage products, sales of regulatory credits to
  other automotive manufacturers and government rebates already passed through to customers. We provide an allowance against
  accounts receivable for the amount we expect to be uncollectible. We write-off accounts receivable against the allowance when they
  are deemed uncollectible.

         Depending on the day of the week on which the end of a fiscal quarter falls, our accounts receivable balance may fluctuate as
  we are waiting for certain customer payments to clear through our banking institutions and receipts of payments from our financing
  partners, which can take up to approximately two weeks based on the contractual payment terms with such partners. Our accounts
  receivable balances associated with our sales of regulatory credits, which are typically transferred to other manufacturers during the
  last few days of the quarter, is dependent on contractual payment terms. Additionally, government rebates can take up to a year or
  more to be collected depending on the customary processing timelines of the specific jurisdictions issuing them. These various
  factors may have a significant impact on our accounts receivable balance from period to period. As of December 31, 2022 and
  December 31, 2021, we had $753 million and $627 million, respectively, of long-term government rebates receivable in Other non-
  current assets in our consolidated balance sheets.

  Financing Receivables
        We provide financing options to our customers for our automotive and energy products. Financing receivables are carried at
  amortized cost, net of allowance for loan losses. Provisions for loan losses are charged to operations in amounts sufficient to
  maintain the allowance for loan losses at levels considered adequate to cover expected credit losses on the financing receivables. In
  determining expected credit losses, we consider our historical level of credit losses, current economic trends, and reasonable and
  supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the future cash flows.
                                                                       61

25/04/23, 17:14                                                                 10-K



        When originating consumer receivables, we review the credit application, the proposed contract terms, credit bureau
  information (e.g., FICO score) and other information. Our evaluation emphasizes the applicant’s ability to pay and creditworthiness
  focusing on payment, affordability, and applicant credit history as key considerations. Generally, all customers in this portfolio have
  strong creditworthiness at loan origination.

         After origination, we review the credit quality of retail financing based on customer payment activity and aging analysis. For
  all financing receivables, we define “past due” as any payment, including principal and interest, which is at least 31 days past the
  contractual due date. As of December 31, 2022, the majority of our financing receivables were at current status with only an
  immaterial balance being past due. Additionally, as of December 31, 2022, the majority of our financing receivables, excluding
  MyPower notes receivable, were originated in 2022.

        We have customer notes receivable under the legacy MyPower loan program, which provided residential customers with the
  option to finance the purchase of a solar energy system through a 30-year loan and were all originated prior to year 2018. The
  outstanding balances, net of any allowance for expected credit losses, are presented on the consolidated balance sheets as a
  component of Prepaid expenses and other current assets for the current portion and as Other non-current assets for the long-term
  portion. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the total outstanding balance of MyPower customer notes receivable, net of allowance
  for expected credit losses, was $280 million and $299 million, respectively, of which $7 million and $11 million were due in the next
  12 months as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the allowance for expected credit
  losses was $37 million and $41 million, respectively.

  Concentration of Risk
        Credit Risk
         Financial instruments that potentially subject us to a concentration of credit risk consist of cash, cash equivalents, investments,
  restricted cash, accounts receivable and other finance receivables. Our cash and investments balances are primarily on deposit at
  high credit quality financial institutions or invested in money market funds. These deposits are typically in excess of insured limits.
  As of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, no entity represented 10% or more of our total receivables balance.

        Supply Risk
       We are dependent on our suppliers, including single source suppliers, and the inability of these suppliers to deliver necessary
  components of our products in a timely manner at prices, quality levels and volumes acceptable to us, or our inability to efficiently
  manage these components from these suppliers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition
  and operating results.

  Inventory Valuation
        Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is computed using standard cost for vehicles and energy
  products, which approximates actual cost on a first-in, first-out basis. We record inventory write-downs for excess or obsolete
  inventories based upon assumptions about current and future demand forecasts. If our inventory on-hand is in excess of our future
  demand forecast, the excess amounts are written-off.

        We also review our inventory to determine whether its carrying value exceeds the net amount realizable upon the ultimate sale
  of the inventory. This requires us to determine the estimated selling price of our vehicles less the estimated cost to convert the
  inventory on-hand into a finished product. Once inventory is written-down, a new, lower cost basis for that inventory is established
  and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis.

        Should our estimates of future selling prices or production costs change, additional and potentially material write-downs may
  be required. A small change in our estimates may result in a material charge to our reported financial results.

  Operating Lease Vehicles
        Vehicles that are leased as part of our direct vehicle leasing program are classified as operating lease vehicles at cost less
  accumulated depreciation. We generally depreciate their cost, less residual value, using the straight-line-method to cost of
  automotive leasing revenue over the contractual period. The gross cost of operating lease vehicles as of December 31, 2022 and
  December 31, 2021 was $6.08 billion and $5.28 billion, respectively. Operating lease vehicles on the consolidated balance sheets are
  presented net of accumulated depreciation of $1.04 billion and $773 million as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021,
  respectively.
                                                                      62

  Digital Assets, Net
        We currently account for all digital assets held as indefinite-lived intangible assets in accordance with ASC 350, Intangibles—
  Goodwill and Other. We have ownership of and control over our digital assets and we may use third-party custodial services to
  secure it. The digital assets are initially recorded at cost and are subsequently remeasured on the consolidated balance sheet at cost,
  net of any impairment losses incurred since acquisition.

         We determine the fair value of our digital assets on a nonrecurring basis in accordance with ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement
  (“ASC 820”), based on quoted prices on the active exchange(s) that we have determined is the principal market for such assets
  (Level I inputs). We perform an analysis each quarter to identify whether events or changes in circumstances, principally decreases
  in the quoted prices on active exchanges, indicate that it is more likely than not that our digital assets are impaired. In determining if
  an impairment has occurred, we consider the lowest market price of one unit of digital asset quoted on the active exchange since
  acquiring the digital asset. When the then current carrying value of a digital asset exceeds the fair value determined each quarter, an
  impairment loss has occurred with respect to those digital assets in the amount equal to the difference between their carrying values
  and the prices determined.

        Impairment losses are recognized within Restructuring and other in the consolidated statements of operations in the period in
  which the impairment is identified. Gains are not recorded until realized upon sale(s), at which point they are presented net of any
  impairment losses for the same digital assets held within Restructuring and other. In determining the gain to be recognized upon
  sale, we calculate the difference between the sales price and carrying value of the digital assets sold immediately prior to sale.

        See Note 3, Digital Assets, Net, for further information regarding digital assets.

  Solar Energy Systems, Net
        We are the lessor of solar energy systems. Solar energy systems are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.

        Depreciation and amortization is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective
  assets, as follows:

  Solar energy systems in service                                                                           30 to 35 years
  Initial direct costs related to customer
    solar energy system lease acquisition
    costs                                                                                                   Lease term (up to 25 years)

        Solar energy systems pending interconnection will be depreciated as solar energy systems in service when they have been
  interconnected and placed in-service. Solar energy systems under construction represents systems that are under installation, which
  will be depreciated as solar energy systems in service when they are completed, interconnected and placed in service. Initial direct
  costs related to customer solar energy system agreement acquisition costs are capitalized and amortized over the term of the related
  customer agreements.

  Property, Plant and Equipment, Net
       Property, plant and equipment, net, including leasehold improvements, are recognized at cost less accumulated depreciation.
  Depreciation is generally computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets, as follows:

  Machinery, equipment, vehicles and
   office furniture                                                                                          3 to 15 years
  Tooling                                                                                                    4 to 7 years
  Building and building improvements                                                                         15 to 30 years
  Computer equipment and software                                                                            3 to 10 years

         Leasehold improvements are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the terms of
  the related leases.

       Upon the retirement or sale of our property, plant and equipment, the cost and associated accumulated depreciation are
  removed from the consolidated balance sheet, and the resulting gain or loss is reflected on the consolidated statement of operations.
  Maintenance and repair expenditures are expensed as incurred while major improvements that increase the functionality, output or
  expected life of an asset are capitalized and depreciated ratably over the identified useful life.

        Interest expense on outstanding debt is capitalized during the period of significant capital asset construction. Capitalized
  interest on construction in progress is included within Property, plant and equipment, net and is amortized over the life of the related
  assets.
                                                                     63

  Long-Lived Assets Including Acquired Intangible Assets
       We review our property, plant and equipment, solar energy systems, long-term prepayments and intangible assets for
  impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset (or asset group) may not be
  recoverable. We measure recoverability by comparing the carrying amount to the future undiscounted cash flows that the asset is
  expected to generate. If the asset is not recoverable, its carrying amount would be adjusted down to its fair value. For the years
  ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, we have recognized no material impairments of our long-lived assets.

         Intangible assets with definite lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, which range from
  three to thirty years.

  Goodwill
        We assess goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances
  indicate that it might be impaired, by comparing its carrying value to the reporting unit’s fair value. For the years ended December
  31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, we did not recognize any impairment of goodwill.

  Capitalization of Software Costs
         We capitalize costs incurred in the development of internal use software, during the application development stage to Property,
  plant and equipment, net on the consolidated balance sheets. Costs related to preliminary project activities and post-implementation
  activities are expensed as incurred. Such costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life of three years.

        Software development costs incurred in development of software to be sold, leased, or otherwise marketed, incurred
  subsequent to the establishment of technological feasibility and prior to the general availability of the software are capitalized when
  they are expected to become significant. Such costs are amortized over the estimated useful life of the applicable software once it is
  made generally available to our customers.

        We evaluate the useful lives of these assets on an annual basis, and we test for impairment whenever events or changes in
  circumstances occur that could impact the recoverability of these assets. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020,
  we have recognized no impairments of capitalized software costs.

  Foreign Currency
        We determine the functional and reporting currency of each of our international subsidiaries and their operating divisions
  based on the primary currency in which they operate. In cases where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar, we recognize a
  cumulative translation adjustment created by the different rates we apply to current period income or loss and the balance sheet. For
  each subsidiary, we apply the monthly average functional exchange rate to its monthly income or loss and the month-end functional
  currency rate to translate the balance sheet.

        Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are a result of the effect of exchange rate changes on transactions denominated
  in currencies other than the functional currency. Transaction gains and losses are recognized in Other (expense) income, net, in the
  consolidated statements of operations. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, we recorded a net foreign currency
  transaction loss of $89 million, gain of $97 million and loss of $114 million, respectively.
                                                                     64

  Warranties
        We provide a manufacturer’s warranty on all new and used vehicles and a warranty on the installation and components of the
  energy generation and storage systems we sell for periods typically between 10 to 25 years. We accrue a warranty reserve for the
  products sold by us, which includes our best estimate of the projected costs to repair or replace items under warranties and recalls if
  identified. These estimates are based on actual claims incurred to date and an estimate of the nature, frequency and costs of future
  claims. These estimates are inherently uncertain given our relatively short history of sales, and changes to our historical or projected
  warranty experience may cause material changes to the warranty reserve in the future. The warranty reserve does not include
  projected warranty costs associated with our vehicles subject to operating lease accounting and our solar energy systems under lease
  contracts or PPAs, as the costs to repair these warranty claims are expensed as incurred. The portion of the warranty reserve
  expected to be incurred within the next 12 months is included within Accrued liabilities and other, while the remaining balance is
  included within Other long-term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. Warranty expense is recorded as a component of Cost
  of revenues in the consolidated statements of operations. Due to the magnitude of our automotive business, accrued warranty
  balance is primarily related to our automotive segment. Accrued warranty activity consisted of the following (in millions):

                                                                                                      Year Ended December 31,
                                                                                       2022                    2021                 2020

  Customer Deposits
        Customer deposits primarily consist of cash payments from customers at the time they place an order or reservation for a
  vehicle or an energy product and any additional payments up to the point of delivery or the completion of installation. Customer
  deposits also include prepayments on contracts that can be cancelled without significant penalties, such as vehicle maintenance
  plans. Customer deposit amounts vary depending on the vehicle model, the energy product and the country of delivery. With the
  exception of a nominal order fee, customer deposits are fully refundable on vehicles prior to delivery and fully refundable in the case
  of an energy generation or storage product prior to the entry into a purchase agreement or in certain cases for a limited time
  thereafter (in accordance with applicable laws). Customer deposits are included in current liabilities until refunded, forfeited or
  applied towards the customer’s purchase balance.

  Government Assistance Programs and Incentives
       Globally, the operation of our business is impacted by various government programs, incentives, and other arrangements.
  Government incentives are recorded in our consolidated financial statements in accordance with their purpose as a reduction of
  expense, or an offset to the related capital asset. The benefit is generally recorded when all conditions attached to the incentive have
  been met or are expected to be met and there is reasonable assurance of their receipt. The government incentives received by us are
  immaterial in all periods presented since the adoption of ASU 2021-10.

        Gigafactory New York—New York State Investment and Lease
        We have a lease through the Research Foundation for the SUNY Foundation with respect to Gigafactory New York. Under the
  lease and a related research and development agreement, we are continuing to designate further buildouts at the facility. We are
  required to comply with certain covenants, including hiring and cumulative investment targets. Under the terms of the arrangement,
  the SUNY Foundation paid for a majority of the construction costs related to the manufacturing facility and the acquisition and
  commissioning of certain manufacturing equipment; and we are responsible for any construction or equipment costs in excess of

  the Energy generation and storage cost of revenues and operating expense line items in our consolidated statements of operations.

        Gigafactory Shanghai—Land Use Rights and Economic Benefits
         We have an agreement with the local government of Shanghai for land use rights at Gigafactory Shanghai. Under the terms of
  the arrangement, we are required to meet a cumulative capital expenditure target and an annual tax revenue target starting at the end
  of 2023. In addition, the Shanghai government has granted to our Gigafactory Shanghai subsidiary certain incentives to be used in
  connection with eligible capital investments at Gigafactory Shanghai (refer to Note 15, Commitments and Contingencies). For the
  years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we received grant funding of $76 million and $6 million, respectively. These incentives
  offset the related costs of our facilities and are recorded as a reduction of the cost of the capital investment within the Property, plant
  and equipment, net line item in our consolidated balance sheets. The incentive therefore reduces the depreciation expense over the
  useful lives of the related equipment.

        Nevada Tax Incentives
        In connection with the construction of Gigafactory Nevada, we entered into agreements with the State of Nevada and Storey
  County in Nevada that provide abatements for specified taxes, discounts to the base tariff energy rates and transferable tax credits of
  up to $195 million in consideration of capital investment and hiring targets that were met at Gigafactory Nevada.

        Gigafactory Texas Tax Incentives
        In connection with the construction of Gigafactory Texas, we entered into a 20-year agreement with Travis County in Texas
  pursuant to which we would receive grant funding equal to 70-80% of property taxes paid by us to Travis County and a separate 10-
  year agreement with the Del Valle Independent School District in Texas pursuant to which a portion of the taxable value of our
  property would be capped at a specified amount, in each case subject to our meeting certain minimum economic development
  metrics through our construction and operations at Gigafactory Texas. This incentive is recorded as a reduction of the related
  expenses within the Cost of automotive revenues and operating expense line items of our consolidated statements of operations.

  Defined Contribution Plan
        We have a 401(k) savings plan in the U.S. that is intended to qualify as a deferred salary arrangement under Section 401(k) of
  the Internal Revenue Code and a number of savings plans internationally. Under the 401(k) savings plan, participating employees
  may elect to contribute up to 90% of their eligible compensation, subject to certain limitations. Beginning in January 2022, we began
  to match 50% of each employee’s contributions up to a maximum of 6% (capped at $3,000) of the employee’s eligible
  compensation, vested upon one year of service. We recognized $91 million of expenses related to employer contributions for the
  401(k) savings plan during the year ended December 31, 2022.

  Recent Accounting Pronouncements
        Recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted
        In October 2021, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued ASU No. 2021-08, Accounting for Contract
  Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers (Topic 805). This ASU requires an acquirer in a business
  combination to recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities (deferred revenue) from acquired contracts using the
  revenue recognition guidance in Topic 606. At the acquisition date, the acquirer applies the revenue model as if it had originated the
  acquired contracts. The ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within
  those fiscal years. Adoption of the ASU should be applied prospectively. Early adoption is also permitted, including adoption in an
  interim period. If early adopted, the amendments are applied retrospectively to all business combinations for which the acquisition
  date occurred during the fiscal year of adoption. This ASU is currently not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated
  financial statements.

        In March 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-02, Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures. This ASU eliminates
  the accounting guidance for troubled debt restructurings by creditors that have adopted ASU 2016-13, Measurement of Credit Losses
  on Financial Instruments, which we adopted on January 1, 2020. This ASU also enhances the disclosure requirements for certain
  loan refinancing and restructurings by creditors when a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty. In addition, the ASU amends
  the guidance on vintage disclosures to require entities to disclose current period gross write-offs by year of origination for financing
  receivables and net investments in leases within the scope of ASC 326-20. The ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after
  December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Adoption of the ASU would be applied prospectively. Early
  adoption is also permitted, including adoption in an interim period. This ASU is currently not expected to have a material impact on
  our consolidated financial statements.

        On August 16, 2022, the IRA was enacted into law and is effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2022. The
  IRA includes multiple incentives to promote clean energy, electric vehicles, battery and energy storage manufacture or purchase, in
  addition to a new corporate alternative minimum tax of 15% on adjusted financial statement income of corporations with profits
  greater than $1 billion. These measures may materially affect our consolidated financial statements, and we will continue to evaluate
  the applicability and effect of the IRA as more guidance is issued.
                                                                    66

        Recently adopted accounting pronouncements
        In December 2022, the FASB issued ASU No. 2022-06, Deferral of the Sunset Date of Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848).
  Topic 848 provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying GAAP to transactions affected by reference rate (e.g., LIBOR)
  reform if certain criteria are met, for a limited period of time to ease the potential burden in accounting for (or recognizing the
  effects of) reference rate reform on financial reporting. The ASU deferred the sunset date of Topic 848 from December 31, 2022 to
  December 31, 2024. The ASU is effective as of December 21, 2022 through December 31, 2024. We continue to evaluate
  transactions or contract modifications occurring as a result of reference rate reform and determine whether to apply the optional
  guidance on an ongoing basis. We adopted ASU 2022-06 during 2022. The ASU has not and is currently not expected to have a
  material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

         In November 2021, the FASB issued ASU No. 2021-10, Government Assistance (Topic 832). This ASU requires business
  entities to disclose information about government assistance they receive if the transactions were accounted for by analogy to either
  a grant or a contribution accounting model. The disclosure requirements include the nature of the transaction and the related
  accounting policy used, the line items on the balance sheets and statements of operations that are affected and the amounts
  applicable to each financial statement line item and the significant terms and conditions of the transactions. The ASU is effective for
  annual periods beginning after December 15, 2021. The disclosure requirements can be applied either retrospectively or
  prospectively to all transactions in the scope of the amendments that are reflected in the financial statements at the date of initial
  application and new transactions that are entered into after the date of initial application. We adopted the ASU prospectively on
  January 1, 2022. Adoption of this ASU did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

        ASU 2020-06
         In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity’s Own
  Equity. The ASU simplifies the accounting for convertible instruments by removing certain separation models in ASC 470-20, Debt
  —Debt with Conversion and Other Options, for convertible instruments. The ASU updates the guidance on certain embedded
  conversion features that are not required to be accounted for as derivatives under Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, or that do not
  result in substantial premiums accounted for as paid-in capital, such that those features are no longer required to be separated from
  the host contract. The convertible debt instruments will be accounted for as a single liability measured at amortized cost. This will
  also result in the interest expense recognized for convertible debt instruments to be typically closer to the coupon interest rate when
  applying the guidance in Topic 835, Interest. Further, the ASU made amendments to the EPS guidance in Topic 260 for convertible
  debt instruments, the most significant impact of which is requiring the use of the if-converted method for diluted EPS calculation,
  and no longer allowing the net share settlement method. The ASU also made revisions to Topic 815-40, which provides guidance on
  how an entity must determine whether a contract qualifies for a scope exception from derivative accounting. The amendments to
  Topic 815-40 change the scope of contracts that are recognized as assets or liabilities.

         On January 1, 2021, we adopted the ASU using the modified retrospective method. We recognized a cumulative effect of
  initially applying the ASU as an adjustment to the January 1, 2021 opening balance of accumulated deficit. Due to the recombination
  of the equity conversion component of our convertible debt remaining outstanding, additional paid in capital and convertible senior
  notes (mezzanine equity) were reduced. The removal of the remaining debt discounts recorded for this previous separation had the
  effect of increasing our net debt balance and the reduction of property, plant and equipment was related to previously capitalized
  interest. The prior period consolidated financial statements have not been retrospectively adjusted and continue to be reported under
  the accounting standards in effect for those periods.

       Accordingly, the cumulative effect of the changes made on our January 1, 2021 consolidated balance sheet for the adoption of
  the ASU was as follows (in millions):

                                                                                              Adjustments from

  Note 3 – Digital Assets, Net
        During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we purchased and/or received an immaterial amount and $1.50 billion,
  respectively, of digital assets. As of December 31, 2022, we have converted approximately 75% of our purchases into fiat currency.
  During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we recorded $204 million and $101 million of impairment losses on such
  digital assets, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we realized gains of $64 million and $128 million,
  respectively, in connection with converting our holdings of digital assets into fiat currency. The gains are presented net of
  impairment losses in Restructuring and other in the consolidated statements of operations. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the
  carrying value of our digital assets held was $184 million and $1.26 billion, which reflects cumulative impairments of $204 million
  and $101 million, each period, respectively. The fair market value of such digital assets held as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 was
  $191 million and $1.99 billion, respectively.

  Note 4 – Goodwill and Intangible Assets
       Goodwill decreased $6 million within the automotive segment from $200 million as of December 31, 2021 to $194 million as
  of December 31, 2022. There were no accumulated impairment losses as of December 31, 2022 and 2021.

      The net carrying value of our intangible assets decreased from $257 million as of December 31, 2021 to $215 million as of
  December 31, 2022 mainly from amortization.

  Note 5 – Fair Value of Financial Instruments
        ASC 820 states that fair value is an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to
  transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that
  should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or a liability. The three-tiered fair
  value hierarchy, which prioritizes which inputs should be used in measuring fair value, is comprised of: (Level I) observable inputs
  such as quoted prices in active markets; (Level II) inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are observable either
  directly or indirectly and (Level III) unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market data. The fair value hierarchy requires
  the use of observable market data when available in determining fair value. Our assets and liabilities that were measured at fair value
  on a recurring basis were as follows (in millions):

        All of our money market funds were classified within Level I of the fair value hierarchy because they were valued using
  quoted prices in active markets. Our U.S. government securities, certificates of deposit, time deposits and corporate debt securities

  investments. Our interest rate swaps were classified within Level II of the fair value hierarchy because they were valued using
  alternative pricing sources or models that utilized market observable inputs, including current and forward interest rates.

        We record gross realized gains, losses and credit losses as a component of Other (expense) income, net in the consolidated
  statements of operations. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we did not recognize any material gross realized gains,
  losses or credit losses. The ending allowance balances for credit losses were immaterial as of December 31, 2022 and December 31,
  2021. We have determined that the gross unrealized losses on our investments as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021
  were temporary in nature.

  Disclosure of Fair Values
        Our financial instruments that are not re-measured at fair value include accounts receivable, financing receivables, accounts
  payable, accrued liabilities, customer deposits and debt. The carrying values of these financial instruments approximate their fair
  values, other than our 2.375% Convertible Senior Notes due in 2022 (“2022 Notes”) and 2.00% Convertible Senior Notes due in
  2024 (“2024 Notes”) (collectively referred to as “Convertible Senior Notes” below).

        We estimate the fair value of the Convertible Senior Notes using commonly accepted valuation methodologies and market-
  based risk measurements that are indirectly observable, such as credit risk (Level II). The following table presents the estimated fair
  values and the carrying values (in millions):

  of solar energy systems, once a lease or PPA contract with a customer has been executed and installation has been initiated.
  Additional costs incurred on the leased solar energy systems, including labor and overhead, are recorded within solar energy systems
  under construction.

         We write-down inventory for any excess or obsolete inventories or when we believe that the net realizable value of inventories
  is less than the carrying value. During the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 we recorded write-downs of $144
  million, $106 million and $145 million, respectively, in Cost of revenues in the consolidated statements of operations.

        Construction in progress is primarily comprised of construction of Gigafactory Texas and Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg,
  and equipment and tooling related to the manufacturing of our products. Completed assets are transferred to their respective asset
  classes and depreciation begins when an asset is ready for its intended use. Interest on outstanding debt is capitalized during periods
  of significant capital asset construction and amortized over the useful lives of the related assets. During the years ended December
  31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, we capitalized interest of an immaterial amount, $53 million and $48 million, respectively.

         Depreciation expense during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $2.42 billion, $1.91 billion and $1.57
  billion, respectively.

         Panasonic has partnered with us on Gigafactory Nevada with investments in the production equipment that it uses to
  manufacture and supply us with battery cells. Under our arrangement with Panasonic, we plan to purchase the full output from their
  production equipment at negotiated prices. As the terms of the arrangement convey a finance lease under ASC 842, we account for
  their production equipment as leased assets when production commences. We account for each lease and any non-lease components
  associated with that lease as a single lease component for all asset classes, except production equipment classes embedded in supply
  agreements. This results in us recording the cost of their production equipment within Property, plant and equipment, net, on the
  consolidated balance sheets with a corresponding liability recorded to debt and finance leases. Depreciation on Panasonic production
  equipment is computed using the units-of-production method whereby capitalized costs are amortized over the total estimated
  productive life of the respective assets. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had cumulatively capitalized gross costs of $2.01
  billion and $1.98 billion, respectively, on the consolidated balance sheets in relation to the production equipment under our
  Panasonic arrangement.

  (1)   Accrued purchases primarily reflects receipts of goods and services for which we had not yet been invoiced. As we are
        invoiced for these goods and services, this balance will reduce and accounts payable will increase. For the year ended
        December 31, 2022, accrued purchases increased as we continued construction and expansion of our facilities and operations.
  (2)   Taxes payable includes value added tax, sales tax, property tax, use tax and income tax payables.

  (1)     There are no restrictions on draw-down or use for general corporate purposes with respect to any available committed funds

          amounts of qualified receivables, inventories, leased vehicles and our interests in those leases or various other assets and as
          may be described below.

        Recourse debt refers to debt that is recourse to our general assets. Non-recourse debt refers to debt that is recourse to only
  assets of our subsidiaries. The differences between the unpaid principal balances and the net carrying values are due to debt
  discounts or deferred financing costs. As of December 31, 2022, we were in material compliance with all financial debt covenants.

  2022 Notes, Bond Hedges and Warrant Transactions
         During the first quarter of 2022, the remaining $29 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2022 Notes was converted and
  settled in cash for their par amount, and 1.2 million shares of our common stock were issued for the applicable conversion premium,
  as adjusted to give effect to the 2022 Stock Split. The note hedges we entered into in connection with the issuance of the 2022 Notes
  were automatically settled with the respective conversions of the 2022 Notes, resulting in the receipt of 1.2 million shares of our
  common stock during the same period, as adjusted to give effect to the 2022 Stock Split. Additionally, during the year ended
  December 31, 2022, we fully settled the warrants entered into in connection with the issuance of the 2022 Notes, resulting in the
  issuance of 37.0 million shares of our common stock, as adjusted to give effect to the 2022 Stock Split.

  2024 Notes, Bond Hedges and Warrant Transactions
        In May 2019, we issued $1.84 billion in aggregate principal amount of our 2024 Notes in a public offering. The net proceeds
  from the issuance, after deducting transaction costs, were $1.82 billion.
                                                                    72

        As adjusted to give effect to the 2022 Stock Split, each $1,000 of principal of the 2024 Notes is now convertible into 48.4140
  shares of our common stock, which is equivalent to a conversion price of approximately $20.66 per share, subject to adjustment
  upon the occurrence of specified events. Holders of the 2024 Notes may convert, at their option, on or after February 15, 2024.
  Further, holders of the 2024 Notes may convert, at their option, prior to February 15, 2024 only under the following circumstances:
  (1) during any calendar quarter commencing after September 30, 2019 (and only during such calendar quarter), if the last reported
  sale price of our common stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of 30 consecutive trading
  days ending on the last trading day of immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion
  price on each trading day; (2) during the five-business day period after any five-consecutive trading day period in which the trading
  price per $1,000 principal amount of the 2024 Notes for each trading day of such period is less than 98% of the product of the last
  reported sale price of our common stock and the conversion rate on each such trading day, or (3) if specified corporate events occur.
  Upon conversion, the 2024 Notes will be settled in cash, shares of our common stock or a combination thereof, at our election. If a
  fundamental change occurs prior to the maturity date, holders of the 2024 Notes may require us to repurchase all or a portion of their
  2024 Notes for cash at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount plus any accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, if
  specific corporate events occur prior to the maturity date, we would increase the conversion rate for a holder who elects to convert
  its 2024 Notes in connection with such an event in certain circumstances. Early conversion of notes which are scheduled to settle in
  the following quarter are classified as current in our consolidated balance sheets.

         In connection with the offering of the 2024 Notes, we entered into convertible note hedge transactions whereby we had the
  option to purchase 89.1 million shares of our common stock at a price of approximately $20.66 per share, as adjusted to give effect
  to the 2022 Stock Split. The cost of the convertible note hedge transactions was $476 million. In addition, we sold warrants whereby
  the holders of the warrants had the option to purchase 89.1 million shares of our common stock at a price of approximately $40.50
  per share, as adjusted to give effect to the 2022 Stock Split. We received $174 million in cash proceeds from the sale of these
  warrants. Taken together, the purchase of the convertible note hedges and the sale of the warrants were intended to effectively
  increase the overall conversion price from approximately $20.66 to approximately $40.50 per share. As these transactions meet
  certain accounting criteria, the convertible note hedges and warrants were recorded in stockholders’ equity and were not accounted
  for as derivatives. The net cost incurred in connection with the convertible note hedge and warrant transactions was recorded as a
  reduction to additional paid-in capital on the consolidated balance sheet.

        The closing price of our common stock exceeded 130% of the applicable conversion price on at least 20 of the last 30
  consecutive trading days of each quarter in 2022, causing the 2024 Notes to be convertible by their holders in the subsequent quarter.
  During the year ended December 31, 2022, $54 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2024 Notes was converted and settled
  in cash for their par amount, and 2.4 million shares of our common stock were issued for the applicable conversion premium, as
  adjusted to give effect to the 2022 Stock Split. The note hedges we entered into in connection with the issuance of the 2024 Notes
  were automatically settled with the respective conversions of the 2024 Notes, resulting in the receipt of 2.4 million shares of our
  common stock during the same period, as adjusted to give effect to the 2022 Stock Split. As of December 31, 2022, the if-converted
  value of the notes exceeds the outstanding principal amount by $186 million.

  Credit Agreement
        In June 2015, we entered into a senior asset-based revolving credit agreement (as amended from time to time, the “Credit
  Agreement”) with a syndicate of banks. Borrowed funds bear interest, at our option, at an annual rate of (a) 1% plus LIBOR or (b)
  the highest of (i) the federal funds rate plus 0.50%, (ii) the lenders’ “prime rate” or (iii) 1% plus LIBOR. The fee for undrawn
  amounts is 0.25% per annum. The Credit Agreement is secured by certain of our accounts receivable, inventory and equipment.
  Availability under the Credit Agreement is based on the value of such assets, as reduced by certain reserves.

        In January 2023, we entered into a 5-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the “RCF Credit Agreement”) with a
  syndicate of banks to replace the existing Credit Agreement, which was terminated. The RCF Credit Agreement contains two
  optional one-year extensions and has a total commitment of up to $5.00 billion, which could be increased up to $7.00 billion under
  certain circumstances. The underlying borrowings may be used for general corporate purposes. Borrowed funds accrue interest at a
  variable rate equal to: (i) for dollar-denominated loans, at our election, (a) Term SOFR (the forward-looking secured overnight
  financing rate) plus 0.10%, or (b) an alternate base rate; (ii) for loans denominated in pounds sterling, SONIA (the sterling overnight
  index average reference rate); or (iii) for loans denominated in euros, an adjusted EURIBOR (euro interbank offered rate); in each
  case, plus an applicable margin. The applicable margin will be based on the rating assigned to our senior, unsecured long-term
  indebtedness (the “Credit Rating”) from time to time. The fee for undrawn amounts is variable based on the Credit Rating and is
  currently 0.15% per annum.
                                                                        73

  Automotive Asset-backed Notes
         From time to time, we transfer receivables or beneficial interests related to certain leased vehicles into special purpose entities
  (“SPEs”) and issue Automotive Asset-backed Notes, backed by these automotive assets to investors. The SPEs are consolidated in
  the financial statements. The cash flows generated by these automotive assets are used to service the principal and interest payments
  on the Automotive Asset-backed Notes and satisfy the SPEs’ expenses, and any remaining cash is distributed to the owners of the
  SPEs. We recognize revenue earned from the associated customer lease contracts in accordance with our revenue recognition policy.
  The SPEs’ assets and cash flows are not available to our other creditors, and the creditors of the SPEs, including the Automotive
  Asset-backed Note holders, have no recourse to our other assets.

  Solar Asset and Loan-backed Notes
        Our subsidiaries pooled and transferred qualifying solar energy systems and the associated customer contracts, our interests in
  certain financing funds or certain MyPower customer notes receivable into SPEs and issued Solar Asset and Loan-backed Notes
  backed by these solar assets, interests to investors or MyPower customer notes receivable. The SPEs are wholly owned by us and are
  consolidated in the financial statements. The cash flows generated by these solar assets and notes receivable, or distributed by the
  underlying financing funds to certain SPEs are used to service the principal and interest payments on the Solar Asset and Loan-
  backed Notes and satisfy the SPEs’ expenses, and any remaining cash is distributed to us. The SPEs’ assets and cash flows are not
  available to our other creditors, and the creditors of the SPEs, including the Solar Asset and Loan-backed Note holders, have no
  recourse to our other assets. We contracted with certain SPEs to provide operations & maintenance and administrative services for
  the solar energy systems. As of December 31, 2022, solar assets pledged as collateral for Solar Asset and Loan-backed Notes had a
  carrying value of $69 million and are included within Solar energy systems, net, on the consolidated balance sheet.

       During the year ended December 31, 2022, we early repaid $819 million in aggregate principal of the Solar Asset and Loan-
  backed Notes and recorded an extinguishment of debt charge of $24 million related to the early repayments in Interest expense in the
  consolidated statement of operations.

  Cash Equity Debt
        In connection with the cash equity financing deals closed in 2016, our subsidiaries issued $502 million in aggregate principal
  amount of debt that bears interest at fixed rates. This debt is secured by, among other things, our interests in certain financing funds
  and is non-recourse to our other assets.

  Automotive Lease-backed Credit Facilities
       Our subsidiaries have entered into various credit agreements for borrowings secured by our interests in certain vehicle leases.
  These facilities are non-recourse to our other assets.

  Pledged Assets
        As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had pledged or restricted $2.02 billion and $5.25 billion of our assets (consisting
  principally of restricted cash, receivables, inventory, solar energy systems, operating lease vehicles, property and equipment and
  equity interests in certain SPEs) as collateral for our outstanding debt.

  Note 12 – Leases
         We have entered into various operating and finance lease agreements for certain of our offices, manufacturing and warehouse
  facilities, retail and service locations, equipment, vehicles, and solar energy systems, worldwide. We determine if an arrangement is
  a lease, or contains a lease, at inception and record the leases in our financial statements upon lease commencement, which is the
  date when the underlying asset is made available for use by the lessor.
                                                                       74

25/04/23, 17:14                                                               10-K



         We have lease agreements with lease and non-lease components, and have elected to utilize the practical expedient to account
  for lease and non-lease components together as a single combined lease component, from both a lessee and lessor perspective with
  the exception of direct sales-type leases and production equipment classes embedded in supply agreements. From a lessor
  perspective, the timing and pattern of transfer are the same for the non-lease components and associated lease component and, the
  lease component, if accounted for separately, would be classified as an operating lease.

        We have elected not to present short-term leases on the consolidated balance sheet as these leases have a lease term of 12
  months or less at lease inception and do not contain purchase options or renewal terms that we are reasonably certain to exercise. All
  other lease assets and lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term at
  commencement date. Because most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate of return, we used our incremental borrowing rate
  based on the information available at lease commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments.

         Our leases, where we are the lessee, often include options to extend the lease term for up to 10 years. Some of our leases also
  include options to terminate the lease prior to the end of the agreed upon lease term. For purposes of calculating lease liabilities,
  lease terms include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise such options.

         Lease expense for operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term as cost of revenues or operating
  expenses depending on the nature of the leased asset. Certain operating leases provide for annual increases to lease payments based
  on an index or rate. We calculate the present value of future lease payments based on the index or rate at the lease commencement
  date for new leases. Differences between the calculated lease payment and actual payment are expensed as incurred. Amortization of
  finance lease assets is recognized over the lease term as cost of revenues or operating expenses depending on the nature of the leased
  asset. Interest expense on finance lease liabilities is recognized over the lease term within Interest expense in the consolidated
  statements of operations.

       The balances for the operating and finance leases where we are the lessee are presented as follows (in millions) within our
  consolidated balance sheets:

        The above table does not include vehicle sales to customers or leasing partners with a resale value guarantee as the cash
  payments were received upfront. For our solar PPA arrangements, customers are charged solely based on actual power produced by
  the installed solar energy system at a predefined rate per kilowatt-hour of power produced. The future payments from such
  arrangements are not included in the above table as they are a function of the power generated by the related solar energy systems in
  the future.

  Lease Pass-Through Financing Obligation
         As of December 31, 2022, we have six transactions referred to as “lease pass-through fund arrangements.” Under these
  arrangements, our wholly owned subsidiaries finance the cost of solar energy systems with investors through arrangements
  contractually structured as master leases for an initial term ranging between 10 and 25 years. These solar energy systems are subject
  to lease or PPAs with customers with an initial term not exceeding 25 years.

        Under a lease pass-through fund arrangement, the investor makes a large upfront payment to the lessor, which is one of our
  subsidiaries, and in some cases, subsequent periodic payments. As of December 31, 2022, the future minimum master lease
  payments to be received from investors, for each of the next five years and thereafter, were as follows (in millions):

  Note 13 – Equity Incentive Plans
        In June 2019, we adopted the 2019 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2019 Plan”). The 2019 Plan provides for the grant of stock
  options, restricted stock, RSUs, stock appreciation rights, performance units and performance shares to our employees, directors and
  consultants. Stock options granted under the 2019 Plan may be either incentive stock options or nonstatutory stock options.
  Incentive stock options may only be granted to our employees. Nonstatutory stock options may be granted to our employees,
  directors and consultants. Generally, our stock options and RSUs vest over four years and our stock options are exercisable over a
  maximum period of 10 years from their grant dates. Vesting typically terminates when the employment or consulting relationship
  ends.

        As of December 31, 2022, 148.0 million shares were reserved and available for issuance under the 2019 Plan, as adjusted to
  give effect to the 2022 Stock Split.

  vested options from the 2012 CEO Performance Award, which amounted to an intrinsic value of $23.45 billion.

  ESPP
         Our employees are eligible to purchase our common stock through payroll deductions of up to 15% of their eligible
  compensation, subject to any plan limitations. The purchase price would be 85% of the lower of the fair market value on the first and
  last trading days of each six-month offering period. During the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, under the ESPP we
  issued 1.4 million, 1.5 million and 5.5 million shares, respectively, as adjusted to give effect to the 2022 Stock Split. As of December
  31, 2022, there were 99.9 million shares available for issuance under the ESPP, as adjusted to give effect to the 2022 Stock Split.

  Fair Value Assumptions
         We use the fair value method in recognizing stock-based compensation expense. Under the fair value method, we estimate the
  fair value of each stock option award with service or service and performance conditions and the ESPP on the grant date generally
  using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The weighted-average assumptions used in the Black-Scholes model for stock options
  are as follows:

                                                                                                      Year Ended December 31,

        The fair value of RSUs with service or service and performance conditions is measured on the grant date based on the closing
  fair market value of our common stock. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield for zero-coupon U.S. Treasury
  notes with maturities approximating each grant’s expected life. We use our historical data in estimating the expected term of our
  employee grants. The expected volatility is based on the average of the implied volatility of publicly traded options for our common
  stock and the historical volatility of our common stock.

  2018 CEO Performance Award
        In March 2018, our stockholders approved the Board of Directors’ grant of 304.0 million stock option awards, as adjusted to
  give effect to the 2020 Stock Split and the 2022 Stock Split, to our CEO (the “2018 CEO Performance Award”). The 2018 CEO
  Performance Award consists of 12 vesting tranches with a vesting schedule based entirely on the attainment of both operational
  milestones (performance conditions) and market conditions, assuming continued employment either as the CEO or as both
  Executive Chairman and Chief Product Officer and service through each vesting date. Each of the 12 vesting tranches of the 2018
  CEO Performance Award will vest upon certification by the Board of Directors that both (i) the market capitalization milestone for
  such tranche, which began at $100.0 billion for the first tranche and increases by increments of $50.0 billion thereafter (based on
  both a six calendar month trailing average and a 30 calendar day trailing average, counting only trading days), has been achieved,
  and (ii) any one of the following eight operational milestones focused on total revenue or any one of the eight operational milestones
  focused on Adjusted EBITDA have been achieved for the four consecutive fiscal quarters on an annualized basis and subsequently
  reported by us in our consolidated financial statements filed with our Forms 10-Q and/or 10-K. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net
  income (loss) attributable to common stockholders before interest expense, provision (benefit) for income taxes, depreciation and
  amortization and stock-based compensation. Upon vesting and exercise, including the payment of the exercise price of $23.34 per
  share as adjusted to give effect to the 2020 Stock Split and the 2022 Stock Split, our CEO must hold shares that he acquires for five
  years post-exercise, other than a cashless exercise where shares are simultaneously sold to pay for the exercise price and any
  required tax withholding.

        The achievement status of the operational milestones as of December 31, 2022 is provided below. Although an operational
  milestone is deemed achieved in the last quarter of the relevant annualized period, it may be certified only after the financial
  statements supporting its achievement have been filed with our Forms 10-Q and/or 10-K.

         Stock-based compensation under the 2018 CEO Performance Award represents a non-cash expense and is recorded as a
  Selling, general, and administrative operating expense in our consolidated statements of operations. In each quarter since the grant of
  the 2018 CEO Performance Award, we have recognized expense, generally on a pro-rated basis, for only the number of tranches (up
  to the maximum of 12 tranches) that corresponds to the number of operational milestones that have been achieved or have been
  determined probable of being achieved in the future, in accordance with the following principles.

        On the grant date, a Monte Carlo simulation was used to determine for each tranche (i) a fixed amount of expense for such
  tranche and (ii) the future time when the market capitalization milestone for such tranche was expected to be achieved, or its
  “expected market capitalization milestone achievement time.” Separately, based on a subjective assessment of our future financial
  performance, each quarter we determine whether it is probable that we will achieve each operational milestone that has not
  previously been achieved or deemed probable of achievement and if so, the future time when we expect to achieve that operational
  milestone, or its “expected operational milestone achievement time.”

        During the first quarter of 2022, three operational milestones were achieved and consequently, we recognized an aggregate
  catch-up expense of $11 million.

       As of December 31, 2022, all remaining unrecognized stock-based compensation expense under the 2018 CEO Performance
  Award has been recognized. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, we recorded stock-based compensation
  expense of $66 million, $910 million and $838 million, respectively, related to the 2018 CEO Performance Award.

  Other Performance-Based Grants
  2021 Performance-Based Stock Option & RSU Awards
         During the fourth quarter of 2021, the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors granted to certain employees
  performance-based RSUs and stock options to purchase an aggregate 2.2 million shares of our common stock, as adjusted to give
  effect to the 2022 Stock Split. We begin recording stock-based compensation expense when the performance milestones become
  probable of achievement. Following achievement, vesting occurs over a two-year period with continued employment. As of
  December 31, 2022, we had unrecognized stock-based compensation expense of $204 million, which will be recognized over a
  weighted-average period of 3.2 years. For the year ended December 31, 2022, we recorded $159 million of stock-based
  compensation expense related to this grant, net of forfeitures.

        Our income tax benefits recognized from stock-based compensation arrangements in each of the periods presented were
  immaterial due to cumulative losses and valuation allowances. During the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, stock-
  based compensation expense capitalized to our consolidated balance sheets was $245 million, $182 million and $89 million,
  respectively. As of December 31, 2022, we had $3.94 billion of total unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to
  non-performance awards, which will be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.26 years.

         As of December 31, 2022, we recorded a valuation allowance of $7.35 billion for the portion of the deferred tax asset that we
  do not expect to be realized. The valuation allowance on our net deferred taxes decreased by $1.73 billion in the year ended
  December 31, 2022, and increased by $6.14 billion and $974 million during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020,
  respectively. The changes in valuation allowance are primarily due to changes in U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities incurred in
  the respective year. The decrease in the year ended December 31, 2022 included utilization of $13.57 billion net operating loss carry
  forwards to offset our 2022 U.S. taxable income. We have $532 million of deferred tax assets in foreign jurisdictions, which
  management believes are more-likely-than-not to be realized given the expectation of future earnings in these jurisdictions. We did
  not have any material releases of valuation allowance for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020. We continue to
  monitor the realizability of the U.S. deferred tax assets taking into account multiple factors. In completing this assessment, we
  considered both objective and subjective factors. These factors included, but were not limited to, a history of losses in prior years,
  excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation, future reversal of existing temporary differences and tax planning
  strategies. After evaluating all available evidence, we intend to continue maintaining a full valuation allowance on our U.S. deferred
  tax assets until there is sufficient evidence to support the reversal of all or some portion of these allowances. Given the improvement
  in our operating results and depending on the amount of stock-based compensation tax deductions available in the future, we may
  release the valuation allowance associated with the U.S. deferred tax assets in the next few years. Release of all, or a portion, of the
  valuation allowance would result in the recognition of certain deferred tax assets and a decrease to income tax expense for the period
  the release is recorded.

         As of December 31, 2022, we had $18.0 billion of federal and $14.0 billion of state net operating loss carry-forwards available
  to offset future taxable income, some of which, if not utilized, will begin to expire in 2023 for federal and state purposes. A portion
  of these losses were generated by our acquisition of SolarCity Corporation (“SolarCity”) and some of the other companies we
  acquired, and therefore are subject to change of control provisions, which limit the amount of acquired tax attributes that can be
  utilized in a given tax year. We do not expect the change of control limitations or expiration dates to significantly impact our ability
  to utilize these attributes.

        As of December 31, 2022, we had research and development tax credits of $969 million and $734 million for federal and state
  income tax purposes, respectively. If not utilized, the federal research and development tax credits will expire in various amounts
  beginning in 2024. However, the state of California research and development tax credits can be carried forward indefinitely. In
  addition, we have other general business tax credits of $197 million for federal income tax purposes, which will not begin to
  significantly expire until 2033.

         Federal and state laws can impose substantial restrictions on the utilization of net operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards
  in the event of an “ownership change,” as defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. We have determined that no
  significant limitation would be placed on the utilization of our net operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards due to prior
  ownership changes.

        As of December 31, 2022, we intend to indefinitely reinvest our foreign earnings and cash unless such repatriation results in
  no or minimal tax costs. We have recorded the taxes associated with the earnings we intend to repatriate in the future. For the
  earnings we intend to indefinitely reinvest, no deferred tax liabilities for foreign withholding or other taxes have been recorded. The
  estimated amount of such unrecognized deferred tax liability associated with the indefinitely reinvested earnings is approximately
  $168 million.

         As of December 31, 2022, accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are classified as income tax
  expense and amounted to $31 million. Unrecognized tax benefits of $572 million, if recognized, would not affect our effective tax
  rate since the tax benefits would increase a deferred tax asset that is currently fully offset by a valuation allowance.

        We file income tax returns in the U.S. and various state and foreign jurisdictions. We are currently under examination by the
  Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) for the years 2015 to 2018. Additional tax years within the periods 2004 to 2014 and 2019 to 2021
  remain subject to examination for federal income tax purposes. All net operating losses and tax credits generated to date are subject
  to adjustment for U.S. federal and state income tax purposes. Our returns for 2004 and subsequent tax years remain subject to
  examination in U.S. state and foreign jurisdictions.

       Given the uncertainty in timing and outcome of our tax examinations, an estimate of the range of the reasonably possible
  change in gross unrecognized tax benefits within twelve months cannot be made at this time.

  Note 15 – Commitments and Contingencies
  Operating Lease Arrangement in Buffalo, New York
       We have an operating lease through the Research Foundation for the SUNY Foundation with respect to Gigafactory New York.
  Under the lease and a related research and development agreement, we are continuing to further develop the facility.

        Under this agreement, we are obligated to, among other things, meet employment targets as well as specified minimum
  numbers of personnel in the State of New York and in Buffalo, New York and spend or incur $5.00 billion in combined capital,
  operational expenses, costs of goods sold and other costs in the State of New York during the 10-year period beginning April 30,
  2018. On an annual basis during the initial lease term, as measured on each anniversary of such date, if we fail to meet these
  specified investment and job creation requirements, then we would be obligated to pay a $41 million “program payment” to the
  SUNY Foundation for each year that we fail to meet these requirements. Furthermore, if the arrangement is terminated due to a
  material breach by us, then additional amounts may become payable by us.

        In 2021, an amendment was executed to extend our overall agreement to spend or incur $5.00 billion in combined capital,
  operational expenses, costs of goods sold and other costs in the State of New York through December 31, 2029. On February 1,
  2022, we reported to the State of New York that we had met and exceeded our annual requirements for jobs and investment in
  Buffalo and New York State. As of December 31, 2022, we are currently in excess of such targets relating to investments and
  personnel in the State of New York and Buffalo and do not currently expect any issues meeting our applicable obligations in the
  years beyond. However, if our expectations as to the costs and timelines of our investment and operations at Buffalo or our
  production ramp of the Solar Roof prove incorrect, we may incur additional expenses or be required to make substantial payments to
  the SUNY Foundation.
                                                                    83

  Operating Lease Arrangement in Shanghai, China
         We have an operating lease arrangement for an initial term of 50 years with the local government of Shanghai for land use
  rights where we have been constructing Gigafactory Shanghai. Under the terms of the arrangement, we are required to spend RMB
  14.08 billion in capital expenditures by the end of 2023 and to generate RMB 2.23 billion of annual tax revenues starting at the end
  of 2023. If we are unwilling or unable to meet such target or obtain periodic project approvals, in accordance with the Chinese
  government’s standard terms for such arrangements, we would be required to revert the site to the local government and receive
  compensation for the remaining value of the land lease, buildings and fixtures. We expect to meet the capital expenditure and tax
  revenue requirements based on our current level of spend and sales.

  Legal Proceedings
  Litigation Relating to the SolarCity Acquisition
        Between September 1, 2016 and October 5, 2016, seven lawsuits were filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery by purported
  stockholders of Tesla challenging our acquisition of SolarCity. Following consolidation, the lawsuit names as defendants the
  members of Tesla’s board of directors as then constituted and alleges, among other things, that board members breached their
  fiduciary duties in connection with the acquisition. The complaint asserts both derivative claims and direct claims on behalf of a
  purported class and seeks, among other relief, unspecified monetary damages, attorneys’ fees and costs. On January 22, 2020, all of
  the director defendants except Elon Musk reached a settlement to resolve the lawsuit against them for an amount to be paid entirely
  under the applicable insurance policy. The settlement, which does not involve an admission of any wrongdoing by any party, was
  approved by the Court on August 17, 2020. Tesla received payment of approximately $43 million on September 16, 2020, which has
  been recognized in our consolidated statements of operations as a reduction to Selling, general and administrative operating
  expenses for costs previously incurred related to the acquisition of SolarCity. On February 4, 2020, the Court issued a ruling that
  denied plaintiffs’ previously-filed motion for summary judgment and granted in part and denied in part defendants’ previously-filed
  motion for summary judgment. The case was set for trial in March 2020 until it was postponed by the Court due to safety
  precautions concerning COVID-19. The trial was held from July 12 to July 23, 2021 and on August 16, 2021. On October 22, 2021,
  the Court approved the parties’ joint stipulation that (a) the class is decertified and the action shall continue exclusively as a
  derivative action under Court of Chancery Rule 23.1 and (b) the direct claims against Elon Musk are dismissed with prejudice.
  Following post-trial briefing, post-trial argument was held on January 18, 2022.

        On April 27, 2022, the Court entered judgment in favor of Mr. Musk on all counts. On May 26, 2022, the plaintiff filed a
  notice of appeal. The parties have completed briefing and argument will be held before the Supreme Court of Delaware on March
  29, 2023.

        These plaintiffs and others filed parallel actions in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware on or about April 21,
  2017. They include claims for violations of the federal securities laws and breach of fiduciary duties by Tesla’s board of directors.
  Those actions have been consolidated and stayed pending the above-referenced Chancery Court litigation.

  Litigation Relating to 2018 CEO Performance Award
        On June 4, 2018, a purported Tesla stockholder filed a putative class and derivative action in the Delaware Court of Chancery
  against Elon Musk and the members of Tesla’s board of directors as then constituted, alleging corporate waste, unjust enrichment
  and that such board members breached their fiduciary duties by approving the stock-based compensation plan awarded to Elon Musk
  in 2018. The complaint seeks, among other things, monetary damages and rescission or reformation of the stock-based compensation
  plan. On August 31, 2018, defendants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint; plaintiff filed its opposition brief on November 1,
  2018; and defendants filed a reply brief on December 13, 2018. The hearing on the motion to dismiss was held on May 9, 2019. On
  September 20, 2019, the Court granted the motion to dismiss as to the corporate waste claim but denied the motion as to the breach
  of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment claims. Defendants’ answer was filed on December 3, 2019.

          On January 25, 2021, the Court conditionally certified certain claims and a class of Tesla stockholders as a class action. On
  September 30, 2021, plaintiff filed a motion for leave to file a verified amended derivative complaint. On October 1, 2021,
  defendants Kimbal Musk and Steve Jurvetson moved for summary judgment as to the claims against them. Following the motion,
  plaintiff agreed to voluntarily dismiss the claims against Kimbal Musk and Steve Jurvetson. Plaintiff also moved for summary
  judgment on October 1, 2021. On October 27, 2021, the Court approved the parties’ joint stipulation that, among other things, (a) all
  claims against Kimbal Musk and Steve Jurvetson in the Complaint are dismissed with prejudice; (b) the class is decertified and the
  action shall continue exclusively as a derivative action under Court of Chancery Rule 23.1; and (c) the direct claims against the
  remaining defendants are dismissed with prejudice. On November 18, 2021, the remaining defendants (a) moved for partial
  summary judgment, (b) opposed plaintiff’s summary judgment motion and (c) opposed the plaintiff’s motion to amend his
  complaint. In January 2022, the case was assigned to a different judge. On February 24, 2022, the court (i) granted plaintiff’s motion
  to amend his complaint, and (ii) canceled oral argument on the summary judgment motions, stating that the court is “skeptical that
  this litigation can be resolved based on the undisputed facts” and the “case is going to trial,” but that the “parties may reassert their
  arguments made in support of summary judgment in their pre-trial and post-trial briefs.” Trial was held November 14-18, 2022.
  Post-trial briefing is underway and post-trial argument is scheduled for February 21, 2023.
                                                                      84

  Litigation Related to Directors’ Compensation
        On June 17, 2020, a purported Tesla stockholder filed a derivative action in the Delaware Court of Chancery, purportedly on
  behalf of Tesla, against certain of Tesla’s current and former directors regarding compensation awards granted to Tesla’s directors,
  other than Elon Musk, between 2017 and 2020. The suit asserts claims for breach of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment and seeks
  declaratory and injunctive relief, unspecified damages and other relief. Defendants filed their answer on September 17, 2020. Trial is
  currently set for November 27, 2023, to December 1, 2023.

  Litigation Relating to Potential Going Private Transaction
        Between August 10, 2018 and September 6, 2018, nine purported stockholder class actions were filed against Tesla and Elon
  Musk in connection with Mr. Musk’s August 7, 2018 Twitter post that he was considering taking Tesla private. All of the suits are
  now pending in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. Although the complaints vary in certain respects, they
  each purport to assert claims for violations of federal securities laws related to Mr. Musk’s statement and seek unspecified
  compensatory damages and other relief on behalf of a purported class of purchasers of Tesla’s securities. Plaintiffs filed their
  consolidated complaint on January 16, 2019 and added as defendants the members of Tesla’s board of directors. The now-
  consolidated purported stockholder class action was stayed while the issue of selection of lead counsel was briefed and argued
  before the Ninth Circuit. The Ninth Circuit ruled regarding lead counsel. Defendants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint on
  November 22, 2019. The hearing on the motion was held on March 6, 2020. On April 15, 2020, the Court denied defendants’ motion
  to dismiss. The parties stipulated to certification of a class of stockholders, which the court granted on November 25, 2020. On
  January 11, 2022, plaintiff filed a motion for partial summary judgment. On April 1, 2022, the Court granted in part plaintiffs’
  motion for partial summary judgment. The Company disagrees with the ruling and accordingly, on April 22, 2022, asked the Court
  for reconsideration or, in the alternative, certification to file an interlocutory appeal. On June 16, 2022, in response to Tesla’s
  motions, the Court denied certification to appeal and declined to reconsider its opinion but clarified its summary judgment ruling to
  make clear that it had not ruled that any misstatements it identified met the required materiality element under the securities statute.
  The issue of materiality and reliance will both be questions for the jury to decide at trial, which started on January 17, 2023.

         Between October 17, 2018 and March 8, 2021, seven derivative lawsuits were filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery,
  purportedly on behalf of Tesla, against Mr. Musk and the members of Tesla’s board of directors, as constituted at relevant times, in
  relation to statements made and actions connected to a potential going private transaction, with certain of the lawsuits challenging
  additional Twitter posts by Mr. Musk, among other things. Five of those actions were consolidated, and all seven actions have been
  stayed pending resolution of the above-referenced consolidated purported stockholder class action. In addition to these cases, two
  derivative lawsuits were filed on October 25, 2018 and February 11, 2019 in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware,
  purportedly on behalf of Tesla, against Mr. Musk and the members of the Tesla board of directors as then constituted. Those cases
  have also been consolidated and stayed pending resolution of the above-referenced consolidated purported stockholder class action.

        On October 21, 2022, a lawsuit was filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery by a purported shareholder of Tesla alleging,
  among other things, that board members breached their fiduciary duties in connection with their oversight of the Company’s 2018
  settlement with the SEC, as amended. Among other things, the plaintiff seeks reforms to the Company’s corporate governance and
  internal procedures, unspecified damages, and attorneys’ fees. The parties reached an agreement to stay the case until March 7, 2023.

        Unless otherwise stated, the individual defendants named in the stockholder proceedings described above and the Company
  with respect to the stockholder class action proceedings described above believe that the claims in such proceedings have no merit
  and intend to defend against them vigorously. We are unable to reasonably estimate the possible loss or range of loss, if any,
  associated with these claims.

         On November 15, 2021, JPMorgan Chase Bank (“JP Morgan”) filed a lawsuit against Tesla in the Southern District of New
  York alleging breach of a stock warrant agreement that was entered into as part of a convertible notes offering in 2014. In 2018, JP
  Morgan informed Tesla that it had adjusted the strike price based upon Mr. Musk’s August 7, 2018 Twitter post that he was
  considering taking Tesla private. Tesla disputed JP Morgan’s adjustment as a violation of the parties’ agreement. In 2021, Tesla
  delivered shares to JP Morgan per the agreement, which they duly accepted. JP Morgan now alleges that it is owed approximately
  $162 million as the value of additional shares that it claims should have been delivered as a result of the adjustment to the strike
  price in 2018. On January 24, 2022, Tesla filed multiple counterclaims as part of its answer to the underlying lawsuit, asserting
  among other points that JP Morgan should have terminated the stock warrant agreement in 2018 rather than make an adjustment to
  the strike price that it should have known would lead to a commercially unreasonable result. Tesla believes that the adjustments
  made by JP Morgan were neither proper nor commercially reasonable, as required under the stock warrant agreements. JP Morgan
  filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings, which Tesla opposed, and that motion is currently pending before the Court.
                                                                     85

  Litigation and Investigations Relating to Alleged Discrimination and Harassment
         On October 4, 2021, in a case captioned Diaz v. Tesla, a jury in the Northern District of California returned a verdict of $136.9
  million against Tesla on claims by a former contingent worker that he was subjected to race discrimination while assigned to work at
  Tesla’s Fremont Factory from 2015-2016. On November 16, 2021, Tesla filed a post-trial motion for relief that included a request for
  a new trial or reduction of the jury’s damages. The Court held a hearing on Tesla’s motion on January 19, 2022. On April 13, 2022,
  the Court granted Tesla’s motion in part, reducing the total damages to $15 million and conditionally denied the motion for a new
  trial subject to the plaintiff’s acceptance of the reduced award. On June 21, 2022, the plaintiff rejected the reduced award and, as a
  result, on June 27, 2022, the Court ordered a new trial on damages only, to commence on March 27, 2023. Tesla continues to believe
  that the facts and law do not justify the damages awarded and is assessing its next steps.

         On February 9, 2022, shortly after the Diaz jury verdict, the California Civil Rights Department (”CRD,” formerly “DFEH”)
  filed a civil complaint against Tesla in Alameda County, California Superior Court, alleging systemic race discrimination, hostile
  work environment and pay equity claims, among others. CRD’s amended complaint seeks monetary damages and injunctive relief.
  On September 22, 2022, Tesla filed a cross complaint against CRD, alleging that it violated the Administrative Procedures Act by
  failing to follow statutory pre-requisites prior to filing suit and that cross complaint was subject to a sustained demurrer. Tesla has
  until February 3, 2023 to amend its cross complaint. The case is now in discovery.

         Additionally, on June 1, 2022 the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) issued a cause finding against Tesla
  that closely parallels the CRD’s allegations. Tesla is in the process of setting up a mandatory mediation with the EEOC.

         On June 16, 2022, two Tesla stockholders filed separate derivative actions in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of
  Texas, purportedly on behalf of Tesla, against certain of Tesla’s current and former directors. Both suits assert claims for breach of
  fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, and violation of the federal securities laws in connection with alleged race and gender
  discrimination and sexual harassment. Among other things, plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief, unspecified damages
  payable to Tesla, and attorneys’ fees. On July 22, 2022, the Court consolidated the two cases and on September 6, 2022, plaintiffs
  filed a consolidated complaint. On November 7, 2022, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the case. Plaintiffs filed a response of
  January 13, 2023, and the defendants’ reply is due February 17, 2023.

  Certain Investigations and Other Matters
        We receive requests for information from regulators and governmental authorities, such as the National Highway Traffic
  Safety Administration, the National Transportation Safety Board, the SEC, the Department of Justice (“DOJ”) and various state,
  federal, and international agencies. We routinely cooperate with such regulatory and governmental requests, including subpoenas,
  formal and informal requests and other investigations and inquiries.

        For example, the SEC had issued subpoenas to Tesla in connection with Elon Musk’s prior statement that he was considering
  taking Tesla private. The take-private investigation was resolved and closed with a settlement entered into with the SEC in
  September 2018 and as further clarified in April 2019 in an amendment. The SEC also has periodically issued subpoenas to us
  seeking information on our governance processes around compliance with the SEC settlement, as amended.

        Separately, the company has received requests from the DOJ for documents related to Tesla’s Autopilot and FSD features. To
  our knowledge no government agency in any ongoing investigation has concluded that any wrongdoing occurred. We cannot predict
  the outcome or impact of any ongoing matters. Should the government decide to pursue an enforcement action, there exists the
  possibility of a material adverse impact on our business, results of operation, prospects, cash flows and financial position.

        We are also subject to various other legal proceedings and claims that arise from the normal course of business activities. If an
  unfavorable ruling or development were to occur, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on our business, results of
  operations, prospects, cash flows, financial position and brand.
                                                                    86

  Letters of Credit
        As of December 31, 2022, we had $318 million of unused letters of credit outstanding.

  Note 16 – Variable Interest Entity Arrangements
        We have entered into various arrangements with investors to facilitate the funding and monetization of our solar energy
  systems and vehicles. In particular, our wholly owned subsidiaries and fund investors have formed and contributed cash and assets
  into various financing funds and entered into related agreements. We have determined that the funds are VIEs and we are the
  primary beneficiary of these VIEs by reference to the power and benefits criterion under ASC 810. We have considered the
  provisions within the agreements, which grant us the power to manage and make decisions that affect the operation of these VIEs,
  including determining the solar energy systems and the associated customer contracts to be sold or contributed to these VIEs,
  redeploying solar energy systems and managing customer receivables. We consider that the rights granted to the fund investors
  under the agreements are more protective in nature rather than participating.

         As the primary beneficiary of these VIEs, we consolidate in the financial statements the financial position, results of
  operations and cash flows of these VIEs, and all intercompany balances and transactions between us and these VIEs are eliminated
  in the consolidated financial statements. Cash distributions of income and other receipts by a fund, net of agreed upon expenses,
  estimated expenses, tax benefits and detriments of income and loss and tax credits, are allocated to the fund investor and our
  subsidiary as specified in the agreements.

        Generally, our subsidiary has the option to acquire the fund investor’s interest in the fund for an amount based on the market
  value of the fund or the formula specified in the agreements.

        Upon the sale or liquidation of a fund, distributions would occur in the order and priority specified in the agreements.

         Pursuant to management services, maintenance and warranty arrangements, we have been contracted to provide services to the
  funds, such as operations and maintenance support, accounting, lease servicing and performance reporting. In some instances, we
  have guaranteed payments to the fund investors as specified in the agreements. A fund’s creditors have no recourse to our general
  credit or to that of other funds. Certain assets of the funds have been pledged as collateral for their obligations.

        The aggregate carrying values of the VIEs’ assets and liabilities, after elimination of any intercompany transactions and
  balances, in the consolidated balance sheets were as follows (in millions):

                                                                                                  December 31,           December 31,

  Note 17 – Related Party Transactions
        In February 2020, our CEO and a member of our Board of Directors purchased from us 195,555 and 18,750 shares,
  respectively, as adjusted to give effect to the 2022 Stock Split, of our common stock in a public offering at the public offering price
  for an aggregate $10 million and $1 million, respectively.
                                                                       87

        In June 2020, our CEO entered into an indemnification agreement with us for an interim term of 90 days. During the interim
  term, we resumed our annual evaluation of all available options for providing directors’ and officers’ indemnity coverage, which we
  had suspended during the height of shelter-in-place requirements related to the COVID-19 pandemic. As part of such process, we
  obtained a binding market quote for a directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policy with an aggregate coverage limit of $100
  million.

        Pursuant to the indemnification agreement, our CEO provided, from his personal funds, directors’ and officers’ indemnity
  coverage to us during the interim term in the event such coverage is not indemnifiable by us, up to a total of $100 million. In return,
  we paid our CEO a total of $3 million, which represents the market-based premium for the market quote described above as prorated
  for 90 days and further discounted by 50%. Following the lapse of the 90-day period, we did not extend the term of the
  indemnification agreement with our CEO and instead bound a customary directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policy with third-
  party carriers.

       In relation to our CEO’s exercise of stock options and sale of common stock from the 2012 CEO Performance Award, Tesla
  withheld the appropriate amount of taxes. However, given the significant amounts involved, our CEO entered into an
  indemnification agreement with us in November 2021 for additional taxes owed, if any.

        Tesla periodically does business with certain entities with which its CEO and directors are affiliated, such as SpaceX and
  Twitter, Inc., in accordance with our Related Person Transactions Policy. Such transactions have not had to date, and are not
  currently expected to have, a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

  Note 18 – Segment Reporting and Information about Geographic Areas
        We have two operating and reportable segments: (i) automotive and (ii) energy generation and storage. The automotive
  segment includes the design, development, manufacturing, sales and leasing of electric vehicles as well as sales of automotive
  regulatory credits. Additionally, the automotive segment is also comprised of services and other, which includes non-warranty after-
  sales vehicle services and parts, paid Supercharging, sales of used vehicles, retail merchandise and vehicle insurance revenue. The
  energy generation and storage segment includes the design, manufacture, installation, sales and leasing of solar energy generation
  and energy storage products and related services and sales of solar energy systems incentives. Our CODM does not evaluate
  operating segments using asset or liability information. The following table presents revenues and gross profit by reportable segment

  ITEM 9.            CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL
                  DISCLOSURE
        None.

  ITEM 9A.           CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
         Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the
  effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
  amended (the “Exchange Act”). In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, our management recognizes that
  any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the
  desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource
  constraints and that our management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures
  relative to their costs.

        Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of December 31,
  2022, our disclosure controls and procedures were designed at a reasonable assurance level and were effective to provide reasonable
  assurance that the information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded,
  processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms, and that such information is
  accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, as
  appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.

  Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
        Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal
  control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
  Financial Officer to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
  statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and
  procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
  dispositions of our assets; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
  financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being
  made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding
  prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the
  financial statements.

        Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
  Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on criteria
  established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
  Treadway Commission (“COSO”). Our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of
  December 31, 2022.

        Our independent registered public accounting firm, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, has audited the effectiveness of our internal
  control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, as stated in their report which is included herein.

  Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls
        Because of inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements and
  projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because
  of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
        There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended December 31,
  2022, which has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
