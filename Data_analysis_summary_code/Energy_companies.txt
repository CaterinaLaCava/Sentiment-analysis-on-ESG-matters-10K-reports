ABOUT GENERAL ELECTRIC. General Electric Company (General Electric, GE or the Company) is a high-tech industrial company that today
operates worldwide through three segments: Aerospace, Renewable Energy, and Power. Our products include commercial and military aircraft engines
and systems; wind and other renewable energy generation equipment and grid solutions; and gas, steam, nuclear and other power generation
equipment. We have significant global installed bases of equipment across these sectors, and services to support these products are also an important
part of our business alongside new equipment sales.

In November 2021, we announced a strategic plan to form three industry-leading, global, investment-grade public companies from (i) our Aerospace
business, (ii) our Renewable Energy, Power, Digital and Energy Financial Services businesses, which we plan to combine and refer to as GE Vernova,
and (iii) our former HealthCare business. In July 2022, we announced the new brand names for our three planned future companies: GE Aerospace,
GE HealthCare and GE Vernova. For purposes of this report, we refer to our reporting segments as Aerospace (previously Aviation), HealthCare
(previously Healthcare), Renewable Energy and Power. The composition of these reporting segments is unchanged. On January 3, 2023, we
completed the separation of the HealthCare business from GE through the spin-off of GE HealthCare Technologies Inc. (GE HealthCare). In the spin-
off, GE made a pro-rata distribution of approximately 80.1% of the shares of GE HealthCare’s common stock to GE shareholders, retaining
approximately 19.9% of GE HealthCare common stock. This spin-off marked the culmination of our first business separation in accordance with the
November 2021 strategic plan, and we are working toward the planned spin-off of GE Vernova.

Over our more than 130-year history, GE’s innovation and technology have improved quality of life around the world by adapting and innovating
solutions to pressing global challenges related to the future of flight, the energy transition and precision healthcare. At GE Aerospace, with a
differentiated product and technology portfolio across the commercial and military sectors, we are well positioned to serve customers in expanding and
upgrading their fleets amidst the demand ramp for engines and services with the ongoing recovery from the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic. At the
same time, we are working to develop next generation engine programs that will allow a smarter and more efficient future of flight, including efforts to
support increased use of sustainable aviation fuel with our engines’ capabilities and developing new engine architectures such as open fan, hybrid
electric and hydrogen technologies. The GE Vernova portfolio of businesses are positioned to lead the energy transition, helping the energy sector
solve for sustainability, reliability and affordability. These businesses are at the center of a dynamic and growing market, as the world faces a
significant increase in electricity demand in the coming decades along with the need to electrify and decarbonize. With a range of power generation
technologies spanning gas power, onshore and offshore wind and others, as well as power grid automation and hardware, these businesses offer
solutions for customers to reduce emissions, meet the growth in electricity demand and make energy more accessible globally, secure and resilient.
And GE HealthCare, as an independent company since January 2023, will carry forward its mission of advancing precision care to help solve the
healthcare industry’s challenges in harnessing data more effectively to provide better outcomes for patients, improving productivity and extending care
out of the hospital to alternative care sites.

We believe our businesses’ strategies and focus on these significant global challenges are well aligned with broader goals of sustainable development,
and we approach sustainability with GE’s commitment to innovation as a central element. Sustainability priorities are embedded in our policies,
leadership engagement, operating mechanisms, commitments, and, ultimately, our products. In addition to working to develop technologies that will
help build a more sustainable world, we advance GE’s sustainability priorities through our own commitments to our people, communities and planet.
More information that may be of interest to a variety of stakeholders about GE’s sustainability approach, priorities and performance, including about
safety, greenhouse gas emission reductions for our own operations and for our products, environmental stewardship, diversity and inclusion (as also
discussed further below), supply chain and human rights and other matters, can be found in our Sustainability Report.

In the remainder of this report, we discuss GE on a consolidated basis and its businesses as of, and for the years ended, December 31, 2022 unless
otherwise indicated. The HealthCare business was a segment included in GE’s consolidated results for all of 2022, and accordingly we include GE
HealthCare’s results and other details for 2022 in this report. The historical results of GE HealthCare and certain assets and liabilities included in the
spin-off will be reported in GE's consolidated financial statements as discontinued operations beginning in the first quarter of 2023. For the GE Vernova
businesses, we continue to refer to our reporting segments of Renewable Energy and Power, reflecting the organization and management of these
businesses within GE today.

We serve customers in 170 countries. Manufacturing and service operations are carried out at 75 manufacturing plants located in 26 states in the
United States and Puerto Rico and at 130 manufacturing plants located in 32 other countries.

In all of our global business activities, we encounter aggressive and able competition. In many instances, the competitive environment is characterized
by changing technology that requires continuing research and development. With respect to manufacturing operations, we continue to make
improvements through deployment of lean initiatives and we believe that, in general, we are one of the leading firms in most of the major industries in
which we participate.

As a diverse global company, we are affected by economic and market developments around the world, supply chain disruptions, instability in certain
regions, commodity prices, foreign currency volatility and policies regarding trade and imports. See the Segment Operations section within MD&A for
further information. Other factors impacting our business include:
•   product development cycles for many of our products are long and product quality and efficiency are critical to success;
•   research and development expenditures are important to our business;
•   many of our products are subject to a number of regulatory standards; and
•   changing end markets, including shifts in energy sources and demand related to cost, decarbonization efforts and other factors, as well as the
    impact of technology changes.



2022 FORM 10-K 4
The strength and talent of our workforce are critical to the success of our businesses, and we continually strive to attract, develop and retain personnel
commensurate with the needs of our businesses in their operating environments. The Company’s human capital management priorities are designed
to support the execution of our business strategy and improve organizational effectiveness. Our focus on organizational performance and talent will
remain front and center through the execution of our strategic plan to separate into three independent companies. We will continue to monitor various
factors across our human capital priorities, including as a part of our business operating reviews during the year and with oversight by our Board of
Directors and the Board’s Management Development and Compensation Committee. The following are our human capital priorities:
•   Protecting the health and safety of our workforce: GE is committed to establishing and maintaining effective health and safety standards and
    protocols across our businesses, making continuous process improvements, and providing ongoing education. Our Chief Safety Officer, hired in
    2021, has continued to advance our Safety Promotion Office and safety program, leveraging lean as a critical tool to prevent injuries and incidents
    and drive safety as a core operational attribute for the businesses. For the past two years, our annual bonus program for executives has included
    a modifier based on the Company’s safety performance.
•   Sustaining a Company culture based in leadership behaviors of humility, transparency and focus, with a commitment to unyielding integrity: GE’s
    organizational culture supports talent attraction, engagement and retention and promotes ways of working that are strongly connected to our
    goals. In early 2022, we conducted an annual enterprise-wide culture survey. While survey results varied among our businesses, a Company-wide
    view of trends in responses confirmed our employees’ view of GE’s solid foundations in safety, compliance, and employee development. Our
    performance management system, “People, Performance, and Growth,” directly links individual performance outcomes to incentive compensation.
    Supporting our culture of integrity, The Spirit & The Letter, GE’s employee code of conduct, sets forth the Company’s integrity and compliance
    standards.
•   Developing and managing our talent to best support our organizational goals: GE’s approach to talent management aims to ensure strong
    individual and company performance; our employee training and development offerings are designed to support these goals. As a key pillar of our
    talent strategy, GE’s senior management leads an annual organization and talent review for each business to support a strong leadership pipeline
    and succession planning process for our strategy to form three industry-leading, global, investment-grade public companies. To support our lean
    culture transformation, we have two lean leadership development programs designed to elevate high potential executive level talent who can lead
    us towards a more sustainable future. Developed in partnership with our existing leaders, our leadership development programs are premised
    upon a rigorous learning process tied directly to outcomes, with a focus on hands-on, experiential learning and building a lean mindset.
•   Promoting inclusion and diversity across the enterprise: At GE, we are committed to building a more diverse workforce and a more inclusive
    workplace by focusing on transparency, accountability and community. We believe in the value of each person’s unique identity, background and
    experiences, and are committed to fostering an inclusive culture in which all employees feel empowered to do their best work because they feel
    accepted, respected and that they belong. In 2022, we disclosed in our Diversity Annual Report our long-standing commitment to fair and
    competitive pay practices. On average, men and women performing similar work are paid within 1% of each other in each GE business. Going
    forward, our goal remains 100% pay equity in each of our businesses.

Additionally, in 2021, we began publishing a Diversity Annual Report to transparently share our diversity data and hold ourselves accountable for
continuous improvement. To support our inclusion and diversity goals, we have a GE Chief Diversity Officer and Chief Diversity Officers in each
business unit. Additionally, we have several Employee Resource Groups which have added value to our colleagues and businesses by helping to
engage and develop diverse talent for nearly 30 years. These groups accelerate development through mentoring, learning, networking, organizing
outreach and service activities, and they address challenges that are important to their members and the Company through targeted initiatives. These
groups also support our goals to build a diverse talent pipeline through efforts such as partnering with organizations to raise money for scholarship
funds and promoting professional development opportunities.

At December 31, 2022, General Electric Company and consolidated affiliates employed approximately 172,000 people, of whom approximately 58,000
were employed in the United States. Our Aerospace, Renewable Energy, Power, and HealthCare segments employed approximately 45,000, 36,000,
32,000, and 49,000 people, respectively. In addition, Corporate employed approximately 10,000 employees, including legacy GE Capital employees. In
connection with the January 3, 2023 spin-off of GE HealthCare, approximately 49,000 of our full-time employees formerly associated with our
HealthCare segment became employees of GE HealthCare.

At December 31, 2022, GE has approximately 5,745 union-represented manufacturing and service employees in the United States.
Following the spin-off of GE HealthCare, GE has approximately 4,670 union-represented manufacturing and service employees in the United States.
The majority are covered by four-year collective bargaining agreements that were ratified in 2019 and are scheduled to terminate in 2023. GE will hold
negotiations to enter into new agreements on or before their termination dates. While the outcome of the 2023 negotiations cannot be predicted, GE’s
recent past negotiations have resulted in agreements that provide employees with good wages and benefits while addressing the competitive realities
facing GE. GE’s relationship with employee-representative organizations outside the U.S. takes many forms, including in Europe where GE engages
employees’ representatives’ bodies such as works councils (at both European level and locally) and trade unions in accordance with local law.

We are subject to numerous U.S. federal, state and foreign laws and regulations covering a wide variety of subject matters related to our products,
services and business operations, including requirements regarding the protection of human health and safety and the environment. Relevant laws and
regulations can apply to our business directly and indirectly, such as through the effect that laws and regulations applicable to our customers may have
in influencing the products and services they purchase from us. Like other industrial manufacturing companies that operate in the sectors we serve,
which are high-tech, increasingly digitally connected and global, we face significant scrutiny from both U.S. and foreign governmental authorities with
respect to our compliance with laws and regulations. Many of the sales across our businesses are also made to U.S. or foreign governments,
regulated entities such as public utilities, state-owned companies or other public sector customers, and these types of sales often entail additional
compliance obligations. For further information about government regulation applicable to our businesses, see the Segment Operations section within
MD&A, Risk Factors and Note 24.

We own, or hold licenses to use, numerous patents. New patents are continuously being obtained through our research and development activities.
Patented inventions are used both within the Company and are licensed to others. GE is a trademark and service mark of General Electric Company.

Because of the diversity of our products and services, as well as the wide geographic dispersion of our production facilities, we use numerous sources
for the wide variety of raw materials needed for our operations.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
(MD&A). The consolidated financial statements of General Electric Company are prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles (GAAP). Unless otherwise noted, tables are presented in U.S. dollars in millions. Certain columns and rows within tables may not add due to
the use of rounded numbers. Percentages presented in this report are calculated from the underlying numbers in millions. Discussions throughout this
MD&A are based on continuing operations unless otherwise noted. Results for the years ended December 31, 2022 versus 2021 are discussed within
this report. Refer to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021 for discussions of results for the years ended December
31, 2021 versus 2020. The MD&A should be read in conjunction with the Financial Statements and Notes to the consolidated financial statements.

In the accompanying analysis of financial information, we sometimes use information derived from consolidated financial data but not presented in our
financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. Certain of these data are considered “non-GAAP financial measures” under SEC rules. See
the Non-GAAP Financial Measures section for the reasons we use these non-GAAP financial measures and the reconciliations to their most directly
comparable GAAP financial measures.

CONSOLIDATED RESULTS
SUMMARY OF 2022 RESULTS. Total revenues were $76.6 billion, up $2.4 billion for the year, driven primarily by increases at Aerospace and
HealthCare, partially offset by decreases at Renewable Energy and Power.

Continuing earnings (loss) per share was $0.53. Excluding the results from our run-off Insurance business, separation costs, the Steam asset sale
impairment, restructuring costs, non-operating benefit costs, debt extinguishment costs, Russia and Ukraine charges, gains (losses) on purchases and
sales of business interests and gains (losses) on equity securities, Adjusted earnings per share* was $2.62. For the year ended December 31, 2022,
profit margin was 1.8% and profit was up $5.1 billion, primarily due to a decrease in debt extinguishment costs of $6.1 billion, a decrease in non-
operating benefit costs of $2.3 billion, an increase in segment profit of $0.7 billion, a decrease in Adjusted corporate operating costs* of $0.5 billion and
a decrease in interest and other financial charges of $0.3 billion, partially offset by a decrease in gains on equity securities of $1.8 billion, separation
costs of $1.0 billion, the Steam asset sale impairment of $0.8 billion, an increase in restructuring and other charges of $0.5 billion, a decrease in
Insurance profit of $0.5 billion and Russia and Ukraine charges of $0.3 billion. Adjusted organic profit* increased $1.5 billion (32%), driven primarily by
increases at Aerospace and Power and lower Adjusted corporate operating costs*, partially offset by increased losses at Renewable Energy.

2022 FORM 10-K 6
Cash flows from operating activities (CFOA) were $5.9 billion and $0.9 billion for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Cash
flows from operating activities increased primarily due to a decrease in cash collateral paid net of settlements on interest rate derivative contracts, an
increase in net income (after adjusting for amortization of intangible assets, non-cash losses related to our interests in AerCap and Baker Hughes and
non-operating debt extinguishment costs), an increase in cash from working capital and an increase in cash from all other operating activities. Free
cash flows* (FCF) were $4.8 billion and $1.9 billion for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. FCF* increased primarily due to
the same reasons as noted for CFOA above. See the Capital Resources and Liquidity - Statement of Cash Flows section for further information.

Remaining performance obligation (RPO) is unfilled customer orders for products and product services (expected life of contract sales for product
services) excluding any purchase order that provides the customer with the ability to cancel or terminate without incurring a substantive penalty. See
Note 25 for further information.


RPO                                                                                                             2022                  2021               2020

Services                                                                                                    202,061               194,755            184,608
Total RPO                                                                                       $           250,997 $             239,820 $          230,600


As of December 31, 2022, RPO increased $11.2 billion (5%) from December 31, 2021, primarily at Aerospace, from engines contracted under long-
term service agreements that have now been put into service and an increase in Commercial and Military orders; at Renewable Energy, from new
orders at Grid and Hydro exceeding sales; and at Power, driven by Gas Power services and equipment; partially offset by a decrease at HealthCare,
from the impact of contract renewal timing in services.

Total revenues                                                                                      $        76,555 $             74,196 $             75,833


For the year ended December 31, 2022, total revenues increased $2.4 billion (3%). Equipment revenues decreased, primarily at Renewable Energy,
due to fewer wind turbine deliveries at Onshore Wind and lower revenue at Grid; and at Power, due to a decrease in Steam Power equipment on the
exit of new build coal; partially offset by increases at HealthCare, driven by Imaging and Ultrasound; and at Aerospace, primarily driven by more
commercial install and spare engine unit shipments. Services revenues increased, primarily at Aerospace, due to higher prices, increased shop visit
volume and higher volume of commercial spare part shipments; at Renewable Energy, primarily due to higher services revenue at Onshore Wind from
a larger installed base; and at HealthCare, driven by the continued growth of Healthcare Systems (HCS); partially offset by a decrease at Power, due
to lower planned contractual services outages in Gas Power and prior year Steam Power services volume that did not repeat. Insurance revenues
decreased $0.2 billion (5%).
Excluding the change in Insurance revenues, the net effects of acquisitions of $0.3 billion, the net effects of dispositions of $0.2 billion and the effects
of a stronger U.S. dollar of $2.1 billion, organic revenues* increased $4.5 billion (6%), with equipment revenues down $1.3 billion (4%) and services
revenues up $5.7 billion (16%). Organic revenues* increased at Aerospace, HealthCare and Power, partially offset by a decrease at Renewable
Energy.

For the year ended December 31, 2022, continuing earnings increased $4.1 billion primarily due to a decrease in debt extinguishment costs of $6.1
billion, a decrease in non-operating benefit costs of $2.3 billion, an increase in segment profit of $0.7 billion, a decrease in Adjusted corporate
operating costs* of $0.5 billion and a decrease in interest and other financial charges of $0.3 billion, partially offset by a decrease in gains on equity
securities of $1.8 billion, separation costs of $1.0 billion, the Steam asset sale impairment of $0.8 billion, an increase in provision for income tax of $0.8
billion, an increase in restructuring and other charges of $0.5 billion, a decrease in Insurance profit of $0.5 billion and Russia and Ukraine charges of
$0.3 billion. Adjusted earnings* were $2.9 billion, an increase of $1.0 billion. Profit margin was 1.8%, an increase from (5.0)%. Adjusted profit* was
$5.8 billion, an increase of $1.5 billion organically*, due to increases at Aerospace and Power, and lower Adjusted corporate operating costs*, partially
offset by a decrease at Renewable Energy. Adjusted profit margin* was 7.9%, an increase of 160 basis points organically*.

We continue to experience inflation pressure in our supply chain, as well as delays in sourcing key materials needed for our products and skilled labor
shortages. This has delayed our ability to convert RPO to revenue and negatively impacted our profit margins. While the impact of inflation is expected
to be challenging, we continue to take actions to limit this pressure, including lean initiatives to drive cost productivity, partnering with our suppliers and
adjusting the pricing of our products and services. Also, geopolitical uncertainties with the ongoing Russia and Ukraine conflict, as well as recent
COVID-19 impacts in China, are introducing additional challenges. As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately $0.5 billion of remaining assets in
Russia and Ukraine, mainly in our HealthCare and Power businesses, which primarily relate to activity not subject to sanctions or restricted under
Company policy.

SEGMENT OPERATIONS. Segment revenues include sales of equipment and services by our segments. Segment profit is determined based on
performance measures used by our Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM), who is our Chief Executive Officer (CEO), to assess the performance of
each business in a given period. In connection with that assessment, the CEO may exclude matters, such as charges for impairments, significant,
higher-cost restructuring programs, costs associated with separation activities, manufacturing footprint rationalization and other similar expenses,
acquisition costs and other related charges, certain gains and losses from acquisitions or dispositions, and certain litigation settlements. See the
Corporate section for further information about costs excluded from segment profit. Segment profit excludes results reported as discontinued
operations and the portion of earnings or loss attributable to noncontrolling interests of consolidated subsidiaries, and as such only includes the portion
of earnings or loss attributable to our share of the consolidated earnings or loss of consolidated subsidiaries. Certain corporate costs, including those
related to shared services, employee benefits, and information technology, are allocated to our segments based on usage or their relative net cost of
operations.

GE AEROSPACE. Aerospace designs and produces commercial and military aircraft engines, integrated engine components, electric power and
mechanical aircraft systems. We also provide aftermarket services to support our products.

Commercial Engines and Services – manufactures jet engines for commercial airframes. Aerospace engines power aircraft in all categories:
narrowbody, widebody and regional, which includes engines sold by CFM International, a 50-50 non-consolidated company with Safran Aircraft
Engines, a subsidiary of Safran Group of France, and Engine Alliance, a 50-50 non-consolidated company with Raytheon Technologies Corporation
via their Pratt & Whitney segment. This includes engines and components for business aviation and aeroderivative applications as well. Commercial
provides maintenance, component repair and overhaul services (MRO), including sales of spare parts.
Military – manufactures jet engines for military airframes. Our military engines power a wide variety of military aircraft including fighters, bombers,
tankers, helicopters and surveillance aircraft, as well as marine applications. We provide maintenance, component repair and overhaul services,
including sales of spare parts.
Systems & Other – provides avionics systems, aviation electric power systems, turboprop engines, engine gear and transmission components and
services for commercial and military segments. Additionally, we provide a wide variety of products and services including additive machines, additive
materials (including metal powders), and additive engineering services.

Competition & Regulation. The global businesses for aircraft jet engines, maintenance, component repair and overhaul services (including spare part
sales) are highly competitive. Both domestic and international sales are important to the growth and success of the business. Product development
cycles are long and product quality and efficiency are critical to success. Research and development expenditures are important in this business, as
are focused intellectual property strategies and protection of key aircraft engine design, manufacture, repair and product upgrade technologies. In
addition, we are subject to market and regulatory dynamics related to decarbonization which will require a combination of technological innovation in
the fuel efficiency of engines, expanding the use of sustainable aviation fuels and the development of electric flight and hydrogen-based aviation
technologies. Aircraft engine and systems orders tend to follow civil air travel demand and military procurement cycles.



2022 FORM 10-K 8
Our products, services and activities are subject to a number of global regulators such as the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), European
Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) and other regulatory bodies.

Significant Trends & Developments. Our results in 2022 reflect the continued recovery of commercial air travel from the effects of the COVID-19
pandemic. A key underlying driver of our commercial engine and services business is global commercial air traffic, which improved 21% during 2022
compared to 2021, and now stands at approximately 90% of 2019 levels.

The recovery trends vary by region from the travel restrictions imposed by governments and the prevalence of COVID-19 virus variants around the
globe. We remain confident in the recovery, and current trends are in line with our recovery forecast. Consistent with updated industry projections, we
estimate both narrowbody and widebody air traffic to recover to 2019 levels in late 2023. We are in frequent dialogue with our airline, airframe, and
maintenance, repair and overhaul customers about the outlook for commercial air travel, new aircraft production, fleet retirements, and after-market
services, including shop visit and spare parts demand.

As it relates to the military environment, we continue to forecast strong military demand creating future growth opportunities for our Military business as
the U.S. Department of Defense and foreign governments have continued flight operations, and have allocated budgets to upgrade and modernize
their existing fleets. In September 2022, Aerospace and the U.S. Air Force successfully concluded testing on the second XA100 adaptive cycle engine,
marking the final major contract milestone of the Air Force’s Adaptive Engine Transition Program (AETP).

Global material availability and labor shortages, in part driven by the pandemic, continue to cause disruptions for us and our suppliers, and have
impacted our production and delivery across our businesses. We increased our Commercial and Military engine sales units by 13% in 2022 compared
to 2021, and the combined engine sales units increased more than 25% in the second half of 2022 compared to the first half of 2022. We continue to
partner with our airframe partners on future production rates. Aerospace has proactively managed the impact of inflationary pressure by deploying lean
initiatives to drive cost productivity, partnering with our suppliers and adjusting the pricing of our products and services. We expect the impact of
inflation will continue to be challenging and we will continue to take actions to manage.

Total engineering, comprising company, customer and partner-funded and nonrecurring engineering costs, increased compared to the prior year. We
continue to be committed to investment in developing and maturing technologies that enable a more sustainable future of flight.

We continue to take actions to protect our ability to serve our customers now and as the global airline industry recovers. Our deep history of innovation
and technology leadership, commercial engine installed base, including joint ventures, of approximately 40,900 units, with approximately 11,600 units
under long-term service agreements, and military engine installed base of approximately 26,100 units represents strong long-term fundamentals. We
believe Aerospace is well-positioned to drive long-term profitable growth and cash generation over time.

For the year ended December 31, 2022, segment revenues were up $4.7 billion (22%) and segment profit was up $1.9 billion (66%).
RPO as of December 31, 2022 increased $10.0 billion (8%) from December 31, 2021, due to increases in both equipment and services. Equipment
increased primarily due to an increase in Commercial and Military orders since December 31, 2021. Services increased primarily as a result of engines
contracted under long-term service agreements that have now been put into service and contract modifications.
Revenues increased $4.8 billion (23%) organically*. Commercial Services revenues increased, primarily due to increased shop visit volume and
commercial spare part shipments, and higher prices. Commercial Services revenues also increased due to a net favorable change of $0.1 billion for its
long-term service agreements compared to a net unfavorable change of $0.3 billion in the prior year. Commercial Engines revenues increased,
primarily driven by 176 more commercial install and spare engine unit shipments, including 291 more LEAP units versus the prior year, partially offset
by lower GEnx engine production rates and product transition with fewer engine shipments on legacy programs. Military revenues increased, primarily
due to growth in services and 79 more engine shipments than the prior year, partially offset by product mix.
Profit increased $1.8 billion (62%) organically*, primarily due to increased shop visit volume and commercial spare part shipments, higher prices and
the impact of favorable contract margin reviews for long-term service agreements. These increases in profit were partially offset by lower profit on
Commercial Engine shipments driven by product transition with fewer engine shipments on legacy programs and more shipments on newer programs,
inflation in our supply chain and additional growth investment.

Competition & Regulation. While many factors, including government incentives, specific market rules, and permitting regulations and challenges,
affect how renewable energy can deliver outcomes for customers in a given region, renewable energy has become competitive with fossil fuels in
terms of levelized cost of electricity. We continue to invest in improving the durability of our wind turbine products, fleet availability and project
execution with increased focus on project selectivity. Additionally, we continue to explore ways to further improve the efficiency and flexibility of our
hydropower technology with new innovative turbine designs and digital solutions. As industry models continue to evolve, our digital strategy and
investments in technical innovation will position us to add value for customers looking for clean, renewable energy.

Significant Trends & Developments. During the third quarter of 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA) was signed into law, introducing new
and extending existing tax incentives for 10 years. The IRA is expected to resolve recent U.S. policy uncertainty that resulted in project delays and
deferral of customer investments in Onshore Wind and significantly increase near- and longer-term demand in the U.S. for onshore and offshore wind
projects. The timing of this demand growth depends in part on how quickly the IRA incentives are implemented. While the offshore wind industry
continues to expect global growth through the decade, cost pressures and the ability to complete with the rapid pace of innovation remain key
challenges. Finally, our Grid business is positioned to support grid expansion and modernization needs.

We have experienced significant cost inflation across all businesses which we expect to continue, and are working to mitigate through pricing and cost
actions. At Onshore Wind, based on experience across our fleet, we are deploying repairs and other corrective measures to improve our overall quality
and fleet availability resulting in higher warranty and related reserves. Concurrently, we are undertaking a restructuring program to reduce fixed cost,
reflecting our selectivity strategy to operate in fewer markets and to simplify and standardize product variants. Our financial results are dependent on
costs to address fleet availability and quality, execution of cost reduction initiatives and the inflationary environment. Additionally, initiatives to improve
selectivity and pricing as well as U.S. Treasury tax implementation guidance related to the IRA are expected to further improve our results.

For the year ended December 31, 2022, segment revenues were down $2.7 billion (17%) and segment losses were up $1.4 billion.
RPO as of December 31, 2022 increased $1.3 billion (4%) from December 31, 2021 primarily from new orders at Grid and Hydro exceeding sales,
partially offset by the approximately $1.3 billion impact from a stronger U.S. dollar and revenue exceeding new orders at Offshore Wind.
Revenues decreased $2.1 billion (13%) organically*, primarily from 1,400 fewer wind turbine deliveries, primarily at Onshore Wind, including customer
delays and deferrals due to U.S. tax policy uncertainty, and lower revenue at Grid due to increased commercial selectivity, partially offset by higher
services revenue at Onshore Wind from a larger installed base.
Segment losses increased $1.5 billion organically*, primarily attributable to Onshore Wind’s lower U.S. volume, higher warranty and related reserve
charges of $0.5 billion in the third quarter of 2022 in response to the deployment of corrective measures and repair campaigns within our fleet,
execution of lower margin RPO and the impact of transitioning to newer product offerings internationally. Additionally, we observed cost inflation across
all businesses and higher ramp up costs at Offshore Wind. These higher costs were partially offset by the favorable impact of cost reduction initiatives
and lower project related charges, primarily at Grid.

Competition & Regulation. Worldwide competition for power generation products and services is intense. Demand for power generation is global,
and as a result, is sensitive to the economic and political environments of each country in which we do business. Our products and services sold to
end customers are often subject to many regulatory requirements and performance standards under different federal, state, foreign and energy
industry standards. In addition, we are subject to market and other dynamics related to decarbonization, where it will remain important to lower
greenhouse gas emissions for decades to come, which will likely depend in part on technologies that are not yet deployed or widely adopted today but
may become more important over time (such as hydrogen-based power generation, carbon capture and sequestration technologies or small modular
or other advanced nuclear power).

Significant Trends & Developments. During the year ended December 31, 2022, global gas power generation grew mid-single digits and GE gas
turbine utilization grew low-single digits with strength in the U.S. Utilization of the fleet continues to follow growing gas power generation, capturing
shortfalls from coal retirements, and resilient asset usage with a dynamic Europe environment with the Russia and Ukraine conflict and mild winter.
Looking ahead, we anticipate H-class units to be commissioned into the serviceable installed base and the uncertain timing of deal closures due to
financing and the complexities of working in emerging markets. Power has proactively managed the impact of inflationary pressure by deploying lean
initiatives to drive cost productivity, partnering with our suppliers and adjusting the pricing of our products and services. We expect the impact of
inflation will continue to be challenging and we will continue to take actions to manage. Although market factors related to the energy transition such as
greater renewable energy penetration and the adoption of climate change-related policies continue to impact long-term demand (and related
financing), we expect the gas market to remain stable over the next decade with gas generation continuing to grow low-single-digits. We believe gas
will play a critical role in the energy transition. We remain focused on our underwriting discipline and risk management to ensure we are securing deals
that meet our financial hurdles and we have high confidence to deliver for our customers.

In the first quarter of 2022, we signed a non-binding memorandum of understanding for GE Steam Power to sell a portion of its business to Électricité
de France S.A. (EDF), which resulted in a reclassification of that business to held for sale. In the fourth quarter of 2022, we signed a binding
agreement and expect to complete the sale, subject to regulatory approval, in the second half of 2023. In the second quarter of 2022, we announced
that Gas Power intends to acquire Nexus Controls, a business specializing in aftermarket control system upgrades and controls field services. The
deal, which is subject to customary closing conditions including regulatory approval and mandatory information and consultation processes with
employees and their representatives, is expected to close in the second quarter of 2023.

We continue to invest in new product development, such as our Nuclear small modular reactors and our HA-Turbines, with over 1.6 million operating
hours. Our fundamentals remain strong with approximately $69.0 billion in RPO, including 27 HA-Turbines, and a gas turbine installed base of
approximately 7,000 units, including 78 HA-Turbines, which has nearly doubled since 2019, and approximately 1,800 units under long-term service
agreements.

GE HEALTHCARE. HealthCare is a leading global medical technology, pharmaceutical diagnostics and digital solutions innovator. Our products,
solutions and services span the continuum of patient care including screening, diagnosis, treatment and monitoring with the goal of empowering
clinicians to deliver better care at lower cost. Our customers include healthcare providers as well as researchers, including public, private and
academic institutions. We sell our products through a combination of a global sales force and a network of channel partners, including distributors and
other third parties. On January 3, 2023, GE completed the previously announced separation of its HealthCare business, into a separate, independent
publicly traded company. See Note 28 for further information.

advanced in-vivo diagnostics. These products include both contrast imaging and molecular imaging agents.
BioPharma – This business was sold on March 31, 2020. It delivered products, services and manufacturing solutions for drug discovery,
biopharmaceutical production, and cellular and gene therapy technologies.


Competition & Regulation. HealthCare competes with a variety of U.S. and non-U.S. manufacturers and services providers. Customers require
products and services that allow them to provide better access to healthcare, improve the affordability of care and improve the quality of patient
outcomes. Key factors affecting competition include technological innovations, productivity solutions, competitive pricing and the ability to provide
lifecycle services. New technologies and solutions could make our products and services obsolete unless we continue to develop new and improved
offerings. Our products are subject to regulation by numerous government agencies, as well as laws and regulations that apply to various
reimbursement systems or other government funded healthcare programs.

Significant Trends & Developments. Market demand and RPO conversion remain positive despite inflationary and supply challenges continuing to
impact the industry. Global spending in healthcare is solid and expected to continue, particularly in public markets across Europe and Asia. We are
experiencing strong order growth in our China equipment business due to government stimulus programs. Overall, continued patient demand is
leading providers to invest in products and services that increase productivity and reduce operating costs, an important dynamic as healthcare systems
modernize post-pandemic and prepare for increased demand longer-term. Actions of our supply chain, engineering and manufacturing teams, as well
as proactive supplier engagement are driving fewer delays in securing key materials and have improved our ability to deliver products to our
customers. However, shortages are still impacting our ability to deliver certain products. Our expectation is that supply chain pressures will continue to
improve. We continue to experience inflationary pressure within our supply chain, however, we have partially offset this pressure by adjusting pricing of
our products, as well as managing discretionary and fixed cost in our business and prioritizing research and development investments.

We continue to grow and invest in precision health, with a focus on creating new products and digital solutions as well as expanding uses of existing
offerings that are tailored to the different needs of our global customers. We introduced over 40 solutions that aim to improve patient outcomes and
increase healthcare efficiency at the Radiological Society of North America’s (RSNA) 2022 Annual Meeting. For example, we announced a platform of
four inventive components, which are SIGNA One, a new anticipatory user interface with virtually no learning curve; AIR Recon DL; AIR Coils; and
automated workflow solutions, that leverage AI and deep learning to ensure the smoothest scanning experience in magnetic resonance (MR) imaging.
In January 2023 we announced we entered into an agreement to acquire IMACTIS, an innovator in the rapidly growing field of computed tomography
(CT) interventional guidance across an array of care areas. IMACTIS created CT-Navigation™, an ergonomic universal solution that provides
stereotactic needle guidance, enabling intuitive pre-planning and continuous control throughout a wide range of procedures, from diagnosis to
treatment. We remain committed to innovate and invest to create more integrated, efficient and personalized precision care.

increased volume and price. We also continued to make planned research and development and commercial investments.

CORPORATE. The Corporate amounts related to revenues and earnings include the results of disposed businesses, certain amounts not included in
operating segment results because they are excluded from measurement of their operating performance for internal and external purposes and the
elimination of intersegment activities. In addition, the Corporate amounts related to earnings include certain costs of our principal retirement plans,
significant, higher-cost restructuring programs, separation costs, and other costs reported in Corporate.

Corporate includes the results of the GE Digital business and our remaining GE Capital businesses, our former financial services business, including

Adjusted total corporate operating costs* excludes gains (losses) on purchases and sales of business interests, significant, higher-cost restructuring
programs, separation costs, gains (losses) on equity securities, impairments and our run-off Insurance business profit. We believe that adjusting
corporate costs to exclude the effects of items that are not closely associated with ongoing corporate operations provides management and investors
with a meaningful measure that increases the period-to-period comparability of our ongoing corporate costs.

2022 FORM 10-K 14
For the year ended December 31, 2022, revenues increased by $0.2 billion due to $0.5 billion of lower intersegment eliminations, partially offset by
$0.2 billion of lower revenue in our run-off Insurance business and $0.1 billion of lower revenue in our Digital business. Corporate operating profit
decreased by $4.3 billion due to $1.8 billion of lower gains on equity securities, primarily related to our AerCap and Baker Hughes investments.
Corporate operating profit also decreased as the result of $1.0 billion of separation costs and $0.5 billion of lower operating profit in our run-off
Insurance business, primarily due to a charge related to terminating several reinsurance contracts (see Other Items - Insurance). In addition, operating
profit decreased due to $0.8 billion of non-cash impairment charges related to property, plant and equipment and intangible assets as a result of
reclassification of a portion of our Steam Power business to held for sale in the first quarter of 2022 (see Notes 6 and 7). Corporate operating profit
also decreased due to $0.5 billion of higher restructuring and other charges primarily related to our Corporate segment and $0.3 billion of charges from
contracts and recoverability of assets in connection with the conflict between Russia and Ukraine and resulting sanctions, primarily within our
Aerospace and Power businesses. These decreases were partially offset by $0.1 billion of lower losses on purchases and sales of business interests
due to a $0.2 billion held for sale loss within our Power segment in 2021.
Adjusted total corporate operating costs* decreased by $0.5 billion primarily as the result of $0.3 billion of lower functional costs and $0.2 billion of
lower costs associated with EHS and other items primarily driven by core reductions and favorability from interest rate and foreign exchange dynamics.

OTHER CONSOLIDATED INFORMATION
RESTRUCTURING AND SEPARATION COSTS. Significant, higher-cost restructuring programs are excluded from measurement of segment
operating performance for internal and external purposes; those excluded amounts are reported in Restructuring and other charges for Corporate. In
addition, we incur costs associated with separation activities, which are also excluded from measurement of segment operating performance for
internal and external purposes. See Note 20 for further information on restructuring and separation costs.

INTEREST AND OTHER FINANCIAL CHARGES were $1.6 billion, $1.9 billion and $2.1 billion for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and
2020, respectively. The decrease was primarily due to lower average borrowings balances, partially offset by a lower allocation of interest expense to
discontinued operations. Inclusive of interest expense in discontinued operations, total interest and other financial charges were $1.7 billion, $2.5
billion and $3.0 billion for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The primary components of interest and other financial
charges are interest on short- and long-term borrowings.

DEBT EXTINGUISHMENT COSTS were $0.5 billion, $6.5 billion and $0.3 billion for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and
2020, respectively. During 2022, we executed a debt tender in the fourth quarter and incurred debt extinguishment costs of
$0.5 billion in the same quarter. The majority of these costs relate to the present value of accelerating future interest payments associated with the
debt. As a result of these actions, we expect lower interest expense going forward.

(a) Included taxes paid related to discontinued operations.

For the year ended December 31, 2022, the income tax rate was 33.7% compared to 7.8% for the year ended December 31, 2021. The tax rate for
2022 reflects tax expense on pre-tax income. The tax rate for 2021 reflects a tax benefit on a pre-tax loss.

The provision (benefit) for income taxes was $0.5 billion and $(0.3) billion for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The
increase in tax was primarily due to a decrease in tax benefit associated with lower debt extinguishment costs ($0.4 billion), the nonrecurrence of tax
benefits associated with internal restructurings to recognize deductible stock and loan losses in excess of the amount offsetting AerCap and Baker
Hughes tax in 2021 ($0.2 billion) and the increase in pre-tax income excluding debt extinguishment and the net gains in 2022 on our interests in
AerCap and Baker Hughes ($0.2 billion). There was an insignificant tax effect on the net gains in AerCap and Baker Hughes in both periods because
of available capital losses.

For the year ended December 31, 2022, the adjusted income tax rate* was 21.6% compared to 20.2% for the year ended December 31, 2021. The
adjusted income tax rate* increased primarily due to larger non-U.S. losses without a tax benefit.

Absent additional taxes on global income enacted as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (U.S. tax reform) and non-U.S. losses without a tax
benefit, our consolidated income tax provision is generally reduced because of the benefits of lower-taxed global operations as certain non-U.S.
income is subject to local country tax rates that are below the U.S. statutory tax rate.

The rate of tax on our profitable non-U.S. earnings is below the U.S. statutory tax rate because we have significant business operations subject to tax
in countries where the tax on that income is lower than the U.S. statutory rate and because GE funds certain non-U.S. operations through foreign
companies that are subject to low foreign taxes. Most of these earnings have been reinvested in active non-U.S. business operations. Given U.S. tax
reform, substantially all of our net prior unrepatriated earnings were subject to U.S. tax and accordingly we generally expect to have the ability to
repatriate available non-U.S. cash without additional U.S. federal tax cost and any foreign withholding taxes on a repatriation to the U.S. would
potentially be partially offset by a U.S. foreign tax credit. We reassess reinvestment of earnings on an ongoing basis. In 2022, in connection with the
execution of the Company’s plans to prepare for the spin-off of GE HealthCare, we incurred $0.1 billion of tax due to repatriation of previously
reinvested earnings.

A substantial portion of the benefit for lower-taxed non-U.S. earnings related to business operations subject to tax in countries where the tax on that
income is lower than the U.S. statutory rate is derived from our Aerospace operations located in Singapore where the earnings are primarily taxed at a
rate of 8% and our Power operations located in Switzerland where the earnings are taxed at between 17.4% and 18.6%.

The rate of tax on non-U.S. operations is increased, however, because we have losses in foreign jurisdictions where it is not likely that the losses can
be utilized and no tax benefit is provided for those losses. Non-U.S. losses also limit our ability to claim U.S. foreign tax credits on certain operations,
further increasing the rate of tax on non-U.S. operations. In addition, as part of U.S. tax reform, the U.S. enacted a tax on “base eroding” payments
from the U.S. We have taken restructuring actions to mitigate the impact from this provision. The U.S. also enacted a minimum tax on foreign earnings
(global intangible low tax income). Because we have tangible assets outside the U.S. and pay significant foreign taxes, we generally do not expect a
significant increase in tax liability from this U.S. tax on foreign earnings. Overall, these enacted provisions increase the rate of tax on our non-U.S.
operations.

For the year ended December 31, 2022, the increase in expense from global operations compared to 2021 reflects larger non-U.S. losses without a
tax benefit and the impact of revaluing deferred taxes as a result of tax law changes.

our income tax provisions, is provided in the Critical Accounting Estimates section and Note 15.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT. We conduct research and development (R&D) activities to continually enhance our existing products and
services, develop new products and services to meet our customers’ changing needs and requirements, and address new market opportunities. In
addition to funding R&D internally, we also receive funding externally from our customers and partners, which contributes to the overall R&D for the
company.

CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY
FINANCIAL POLICY. We intend to maintain a disciplined financial policy with a sustainable investment-grade long-term credit rating. In the fourth
quarter of 2021, the Company announced plans to form three industry-leading, global, investment-grade companies, each of which will determine their
own financial policies, including capital allocation, dividend, mergers and acquisitions and share buyback decisions.




2022 FORM 10-K 16
LIQUIDITY POLICY. We maintain a strong focus on liquidity and define our liquidity risk tolerance based on sources and uses to maintain a sufficient
liquidity position to meet our business needs and financial obligations under both normal and stressed conditions. We believe that our consolidated
liquidity and availability under our revolving credit facilities will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs.

CONSOLIDATED LIQUIDITY. Our primary sources of liquidity consist of cash and cash equivalents, free cash flows* from our operating businesses,
cash generated from asset sales and dispositions, and short-term borrowing facilities, including revolving credit facilities. Cash generation can be
subject to variability based on many factors, including seasonality, receipt of down payments on large equipment orders, timing of billings on long-term
contracts, timing of Aerospace-related customer allowances, market conditions and our ability to execute dispositions. Total cash, cash equivalents
and restricted cash was $17.3 billion at December 31, 2022, of which $11.7 billion was held in the U.S. and $5.5 billion was held outside the U.S.

Cash held in non-U.S. entities has generally been reinvested in active foreign business operations; however, substantially all of our unrepatriated
earnings were subject to U.S. federal tax and, if there is a change in reinvestment, we would expect to be able to repatriate available cash (excluding
amounts held in countries with currency controls) without additional federal tax cost. Any foreign withholding tax on a repatriation to the U.S. would
potentially be partially offset by a U.S. foreign tax credit. With regards to our announcement to form three public companies, the planning for and
execution of the separations has impacted and is expected to continue to impact indefinite reinvestment. The impact of such changes will be recorded
when there is a specific change in ability and intent to reinvest earnings.

Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash at December 31, 2022 included $2.4 billion of cash held in countries with currency control restrictions
(including a total of $0.1 billion in Russia and Ukraine) and $0.7 billion of restricted use cash. Cash held in countries with currency controls represents
amounts held in countries that may restrict the transfer of funds to the U.S. or limit our ability to transfer funds to the U.S. without incurring substantial
costs. Restricted use cash represents amounts that are not available to fund operations, and primarily comprised funds restricted in connection with
certain ongoing litigation matters. Excluded from cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash was $0.6 billion of cash in our run-off Insurance business,
which was classified as All other assets in the Statement of Financial Position.

In connection with the program we launched in 2020 to fully monetize our Baker Hughes position over approximately three years, we received
proceeds of $4.7 billion in 2022. In addition, we expect to fully monetize our stake in AerCap over time.

Following approval of a statutory permitted accounting practice in 2018 by our primary insurance regulator, the Kansas Insurance Department (KID),
we provided a total of $11.4 billion of capital contributions to our insurance subsidiaries, including $2.0 billion in the first quarter of 2022. We expect to
provide further capital contributions of approximately $3.6 billion through 2024 (of which approximately $1.8 billion is expected to be contributed in the
first quarter of 2023, pending completion of our December 31, 2022 statutory reporting process). See Note 12 for further information.

On March 6, 2022, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $3 billion of our common stock. In connection with this authorization, we
repurchased 13 million shares for a total of $1.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2022.

BORROWINGS. Consolidated total borrowings were $32.4 billion and $35.2 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, a decrease of $2.8
billion. The reduction in borrowings was driven by $10.1 billion of net maturities and repayments of debt including a $6.4 billion debt tender completed
in the fourth quarter of 2022, and $1.0 billion primarily related to changes in foreign exchange rates, partially offset by $8.3 billion issued by GE
HealthCare in the fourth quarter of 2022.

We have in place committed revolving credit facilities totaling $14.4 billion at December 31, 2022, comprising a $10.0 billion unused back-up revolving
syndicated credit facility and a total of $4.4 billion of bilateral revolving credit facilities.

GE HealthCare Actions. In the fourth quarter of 2022, as part of the financing for the planned spin-off, GE HealthCare issued a total of $8.3 billion in
aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured debt. These notes are obligations of GE HealthCare and were guaranteed by GE until the completion
of the spin-off on January 3, 2023. These notes remained with GE HealthCare at the spin-off on January 3, 2023. See Note 10 for further information.

Also in the fourth quarter of 2022, in connection with the planned spin-off, GE HealthCare entered into three new credit facilities totaling $5.5 billion.
These credit facilities consist of a five-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility in an aggregate committed amount of $2.5 billion; a 364-day senior
unsecured revolving facility in an aggregate committed amount of $1.0 billion; and a three-year senior unsecured term loan credit facility in an
aggregate principal amount of $2.0 billion. These credit facilities remained with GE HealthCare at the spin-off on January 3, 2023.

GE Liability Management Actions. In the fourth quarter of 2022, GE used the majority of the proceeds from the senior unsecured debt issued by GE
HealthCare to complete a debt tender to repurchase a total of $6.4 billion of debt issued by GE or certain affiliates (and assumed or guaranteed by
GE). In doing so, we incurred debt extinguishment costs of $0.5 billion, resulting in an aggregate purchase price of $7.0 billion. See Note 10 for further
information.

We are disclosing our credit ratings and any current quarter updates to these ratings to enhance understanding of our sources of liquidity and the
effects of our ratings on our costs of funds and access to liquidity. Our ratings may be subject to a revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning
rating organization, and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. In connection with the planned spin-off of GE HealthCare,
rating agencies reviewed ratings for GE. In the fourth quarter of 2022, Moody’s and Fitch reaffirmed their ratings for GE, and S&P announced that it
changed its outlook for GE from Credit Watch Negative to Stable. For a description of some of the potential consequences of a reduction in our credit
ratings, see the Financial Risks section of Risk Factors.

Substantially all of the Company's debt agreements in place at December 31, 2022 do not contain material credit rating covenants. Our unused back-
up revolving syndicated credit facility and certain of our bilateral revolving credit facilities contain a customary net debt-to-EBITDA financial covenant,
which we satisfied at December 31, 2022.

The Company may from time to time enter into agreements that contain minimum ratings requirements. The following table provides a summary of the
maximum estimated liquidity impact in the event of further downgrades below each stated ratings level.

Our most significant contractual ratings requirements are related to ordinary course commercial activities. The timing within the quarter of the potential
liquidity impact of these areas may differ, as can the remedies to resolving any potential breaches of required ratings levels.

FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND INTEREST RATE RISK. As a result of our global operations, we generate and incur a significant portion of our revenues
and expenses in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Such principal currencies include the euro, the Chinese renminbi, the Indian rupee and the
British pound sterling, among others. The effects of foreign currency fluctuations on earnings was less than $0.1 billion for each of the years ended
December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020. See Note 22 for further information about our risk exposures, our use of derivatives, and the effects of this activity
on our financial statements.

Exchange rate and interest rate risks are managed with a variety of techniques, including selective use of derivatives. We apply policies to manage
each of these risks, including prohibitions on speculative activities. It is our policy to minimize currency exposures and to conduct operations either
within functional currencies or using the protection of hedge strategies. To assess exposure to interest rate risk, we apply a +/- 100 basis points
change in interest rates and keep that in place for the next 12 months. To assess exposure to currency risk of assets and liabilities denominated in
other than their functional currencies, we evaluated the effect of a 10% shift in exchange rates against the U.S. dollar (USD). The analyses indicated
that our 2022 consolidated net earnings would decline by less than $0.1 billion for interest rate risk and for foreign exchange risk.

LIBOR REFORM. In connection with the transition away from the use of the London interbank offered rate (LIBOR) as an interest rate benchmark, the
ICE Benchmark Administration Limited (IBA) plans to cease the remaining USD LIBOR settings immediately following the LIBOR publication on June
30, 2023. The Company’s most significant exposures to LIBOR relate to preferred stock and certain floating-rate debt securities issued by the
Company, which use USD LIBOR. Such preferred stock and floating rate debt are governed by New York law. On December 16, 2022, the Federal
Reserve Board adopted a final rule that implements the Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act by identifying benchmark rates based on SOFR (Secured
Overnight Financing Rate) that will replace LIBOR in certain financial contracts after June 30, 2023. We are in the process of managing the transition,
and any financial impact will be accounted for under Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of
the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting.

STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS
CASH FLOWS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS. The most significant source of cash in CFOA is customer-related activities, the largest of which
is collecting cash resulting from equipment or services sales. The most significant operating use of cash is to pay our suppliers, employees, tax
authorities, and post retirement plans. GE measures itself on a free cash flows* basis. This metric includes CFOA plus investments in property, plant
and equipment and additions to internal-use software; this metric excludes any cash received from dispositions of property, plant and equipment. We
believe that investors may also find it useful to compare free cash flows* performance without the effects of cash flows for taxes related to business
sales, contributions to the GE Pension Plan, discontinued factoring programs, operating activities related to our run-off Insurance business, separation
cash expenditures, Corporate restructuring cash expenditures (associated with the separation-related program announced in October 2022) and
eliminations related to our receivables factoring and supply chain finance programs. We believe this measure will better allow management and
investors to evaluate the capacity of our operations to generate free cash flows*.

Cash from operating activities was $5.9 billion in 2022, an increase of $5.0 billion compared to 2021, primarily due to: a decrease in financial
services-related cash collateral paid net of settlements on interest rate derivative contracts of $1.0 billion, which is a standard market practice to
minimize derivative counterparty exposures; an increase in net income (after adjusting for amortization of intangible assets, non-cash losses related to
our interests in AerCap and Baker Hughes and non-operating debt extinguishment costs) primarily in our Aerospace business; an increase in cash
from working capital of $2.3 billion; and an increase in cash from All other operating activities of $2.5 billion. The components of All other operating
activities were as follows:

The cash impacts from changes in working capital compared to prior year were as follows: current receivables of $(2.8) billion, driven by higher volume
partially offset by the impact of decreases in sales of receivables to third parties in 2021; inventories, including deferred inventory, of $(1.6) billion,
driven by higher material purchases partially offset by higher liquidations; current contract assets of $0.4 billion, driven by higher billings on our long-
term service agreements, partially offset by net favorable changes in estimated profitability; accounts payable and equipment project payables of $2.8
billion, driven by higher volume and lower disbursements related to purchases of materials in prior periods; and progress collections and current
deferred income of $3.5 billion, driven by lower liquidations and higher collections, including $0.6 billion of increased customer collections on
equipment orders to support production at our Aerospace business.

Cash from investing activities was $1.8 billion in 2022, a decrease of $21.9 billion compared to 2021, primarily due to: non-recurrence of sale
proceeds of $22.4 billion from the combination of our GECAS business with AerCap in 2021; cash paid related to net settlements between our
continuing operations and businesses in discontinued operations of $0.3 billion in 2022, primarily related to a capital contribution to Bank BPH, as
compared to cash received of $1.6 billion in 2021, primarily from our GECAS business (both components of All other investing activities); partially
offset by non-recurrence of the acquisition of BK Medical by our HealthCare business of $1.5 billion in 2021; an increase in proceeds of $0.6 billion
from the sales of our retained ownership interest in Baker Hughes and a decrease in net purchases of insurance investment securities of $0.4 billion.
Cash used for additions to property, plant and equipment and internal-use software, which are components of free cash flows*, was $1.5 billion in 2022
and $1.4 billion in 2021.

Cash used for financing activities was $5.6 billion in 2022, a decrease of $39.7 billion compared to 2021, primarily due to: lower cash paid to
repurchase long-term debt of $32.3 billion; GE HealthCare's long-term debt issuance in connection with the spin-off of $8.3 billion and lower other net
debt maturities of $0.9 billion; partially offset by an increase in purchases of GE common stock for treasury of $0.9 billion, the settlement of Concept
Laser GmbH's interest in an Aerospace technology joint venture of $0.2 billion and higher cash paid on derivatives hedging foreign currency debt of
$0.2 billion (both components of All other financing activities). We paid cash to repurchase long-term debt of $6.9 billion and $39.2 billion, including
cash received of $0.3 billion and cash paid of $7.2 billion related to debt extinguishment costs, excluding a non-cash debt basis adjustment of $(0.8)
billion and $0.6 billion in 2022 and 2021, respectively.

CASH FLOWS FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS. Cash from investing activities in 2022 was primarily due to a capital contribution to Bank BPH
from continuing operations. Cash from operating activities and cash used for investing activities in 2021 was primarily due to cash generated from
earnings in our GECAS business and net settlements from GECAS to continuing operations, respectively.

SUPPLY CHAIN FINANCE PROGRAMS. We facilitate voluntary supply chain finance programs with third parties, which provide participating suppliers
the opportunity to sell their GE receivables to third parties at the sole discretion of both the suppliers and the third parties. At December 31, 2022 and
2021, included in accounts payable was $4.1 billion and $3.4 billion, respectively, of supplier invoices that are subject to the third-party programs. Total
supplier invoices paid through these third-party programs were $7.6 billion and $6.9 billion for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021,
respectively. See Note 11 for further information.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES. Accounting estimates and assumptions discussed in this section are those that we consider to be the
most critical to an understanding of our financial statements because they involve significant judgments and uncertainties. Actual results in these areas
could differ from management's estimates. See Note 1 for further information on our most significant accounting policies.

REVENUE RECOGNITION ON LONG-TERM SERVICES AGREEMENTS. We have long-term service agreements with our customers predominately
within our Power and Aerospace segments that require us to maintain the customers’ assets over the contract terms, which generally range from 5 to
25 years. However, contract modifications that extend or revise contracts are not uncommon. We recognize revenue as we perform under the
arrangements using the percentage of completion method which is based on our costs incurred to date relative to our estimate of total expected costs.
This requires us to make estimates of customer payments expected to be received over the contract term as well as the costs to perform required
maintenance services.

Customers generally pay us based on the utilization of the asset (per hour of usage for example) or upon the occurrence of a major event within the
contract such as an overhaul. As a result, a significant estimate in determining expected revenues of a contract is estimating how customers will utilize
their assets over the term of the agreement. The estimate of utilization, which can change over the contract life, impacts both the amount of customer
payments we expect to receive and our estimate of future contract costs. Customers’ asset utilization will influence the timing and extent of overhauls
and other service events over the life of the contract. We generally use a combination of both historical utilization trends as well as forward-looking
information such as market conditions and potential asset retirements in developing our revenue estimates.

To develop our cost estimates, we consider the timing and extent of future maintenance and overhaul events, including the amount and cost of labor,
spare parts and other resources required to perform the services. In developing our cost estimates, we utilize a combination of our historical cost
experience and expected cost improvements. Cost improvements are only included in future cost estimates after savings have been observed in actual
results or proven effective through an extensive regulatory or engineering approval process.




*Non-GAAP Financial Measure



2022 FORM 10-K 20
We routinely review estimates under long-term service agreements and regularly revise them to adjust for changes in outlook. These revisions are
based on objectively verifiable information that is available at the time of the review. Contract modifications that change the rights and obligations, as
well as the nature, timing and extent of future cash flows, are evaluated for potential price concessions, contract asset impairments and significant
financing to determine if adjustments of earnings are required before effectively accounting for a modified contract as a new contract.

We regularly assess expected billings adjustments and customer credit risk inherent in the carrying amounts of receivables and contract assets,
including the risk that contractual penalties may not be sufficient to offset our accumulated investment in the event of customer termination. We gain
insight into future utilization and cost trends, as well as credit risk, through our knowledge of the installed base of equipment and fleet management
strategies through close interaction with our customers that comes with supplying critical services and parts over extended periods. Revisions may
affect a long-term services agreement’s total estimated profitability resulting in an adjustment of earnings.

On December 31, 2022, our net long-term service agreements balance of $(0.7) billion represents approximately (0.3)% of our total estimated life of
contract billings of $202.2 billion. Our contracts (on average) are approximately 18.7% complete based on costs incurred to date and our estimate of
future costs. Revisions to our estimates of future billings or costs that increase or decrease total estimated contract profitability by one percentage
point would increase or decrease the long-term service agreements balance by $0.4 billion. Billings collected on these contracts were $11.7 billion and
$10.0 billion during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. See Notes 1 and 8 for further information.

IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL AND OTHER IDENTIFIED INTANGIBLE ASSETS. We perform our annual goodwill impairment testing in the fourth
quarter. In assessing the possibility that a reporting unit’s fair value has been reduced below its carrying amount due to the occurrence of events or
circumstances between annual impairment testing dates, we consider all available evidence, including (i) the results of our impairment testing from the
most recent testing date (in particular, the magnitude of the excess of fair value over carrying value observed), (ii) downward revisions to internal
forecasts, decreases in market multiples (and the magnitude thereof) or changes to interest rates, if any, and (iii) declines in market capitalization
below book value (and the magnitude and duration of those declines), if any.

We determine fair value for each of the reporting units using the market approach, when available and appropriate, or the income approach, or a
combination of both. We assess the valuation methodology based upon the relevance and availability of the data at the time we perform the valuation.
If multiple valuation methodologies are used, the results are weighted appropriately.

Valuations using the market approach are derived from metrics of publicly traded companies or historically completed transactions of comparable
businesses. The selection of comparable businesses is based on the markets in which the reporting units operate giving consideration to risk profiles,
size, geography, and diversity of products and services. A market approach is limited to reporting units for which there are publicly traded companies
that have characteristics similar to our businesses.

Under the income approach, fair value is determined based on the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at an appropriate risk-
adjusted rate. We use our internal forecasts to estimate future cash flows and include an estimate of long-term future growth rates based on our most
recent views of the long-term outlook for each business. We derive our discount rates using a capital asset pricing model and analyzing published
rates for industries relevant to our reporting units to estimate the cost of equity financing. We use discount rates that are commensurate with the risks
and uncertainty inherent in the respective businesses and in our internally developed forecasts. Discount rates used in our annual reporting unit
valuations ranged from 11% to 21%.

Estimating the fair value of reporting units requires the use of significant judgments that are based on a number of factors including actual operating
results, internal forecasts, market observable pricing multiples of similar businesses and comparable transactions, possible control premiums,
determining the appropriate discount rate and long-term growth rate assumptions, and, if multiple approaches are being used, determining the
appropriate weighting applied to each approach. It is reasonably possible that the judgments and estimates described above could change in future
periods.

We review identified intangible assets with defined useful lives and subject to amortization for impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Determining whether an impairment loss has occurred requires the
use of our internal forecast to estimate future cash flows and the useful life over which these cash flows will occur. To determine fair value, we use our
internal cash flow estimates discounted at an appropriate discount rate. See Notes 1 and 7 for further information.

INCOME TAXES. Our annual tax rate is based on our income, statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various
jurisdictions in which we operate. Tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective governmental taxing
authorities. Significant judgment is required in determining our tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions, including evaluating uncertainties. We
review our tax positions quarterly and adjust the balances as new information becomes available. Our income tax rate is significantly affected by the
tax rate on our global operations. In addition to local country tax laws and regulations, this rate can depend on the extent earnings are indefinitely
reinvested outside the U.S. Historically U.S. taxes were due upon repatriation of foreign earnings. Due to the enactment of U.S. tax reform in 2017,
repatriations of available cash from foreign earnings are expected to be free of U.S. federal income tax but may incur withholding or state taxes.
Indefinite reinvestment is determined by management’s judgment about and intentions concerning the future operations of the Company. Most of these
earnings have been reinvested in active non-U.S. business operations. We reassess reinvestment of earnings on an ongoing basis. In 2022, in
connection with the execution of the Company's plans to prepare for the spin-off of GE HealthCare, we incurred $0.1 billion of tax due to repatriation of
previously reinvested earnings.

We evaluate the recoverability of deferred income tax assets by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including
reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies, which heavily rely on estimates. We use
our historical experience and our short- and long-range business forecasts to provide insight. Further, our global and diversified business portfolio
gives us the opportunity to employ various prudent and feasible tax planning strategies to facilitate the recoverability of future deductions. Amounts
recorded for deferred tax assets related to non-U.S. net operating losses, net of valuation allowances, were $1.3 billion and $1.5 billion at December
31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Of this, $0.1 billion at both December 31, 2022 and 2021, were associated with losses reported in discontinued
operations, primarily related to our legacy financial services businesses. See Other Consolidated Information – Income Taxes section and Notes 1 and
15 for further information.

LOSS CONTINGENCIES. Loss contingencies are existing conditions, situations or circumstances involving uncertainty as to possible loss that will
ultimately be resolved when future events occur or fail to occur. Such contingencies include, but are not limited to, environmental obligations, litigation,
regulatory investigations and proceedings, product quality and losses resulting from other events and developments. When a loss is considered
probable and reasonably estimable, we record a liability in the amount of our best estimate for the ultimate loss. When there appears to be a range of
possible costs with equal likelihood, liabilities are based on the low-end of such range. However, the likelihood of a loss with respect to a particular
contingency is often difficult to predict and determining a meaningful estimate of the loss or a range of loss may not be practicable based on the
information available and the potential effect of future events and negotiations with or decisions by third parties that will determine the ultimate
resolution of the contingency. Moreover, it is not uncommon for such matters to be resolved over many years, during which time relevant developments
and new information must be continuously evaluated to determine both the likelihood of potential loss and whether it is possible to reasonably estimate
a range of possible loss. Disclosure is provided for material loss contingencies when a loss is probable but a reasonable estimate cannot be made,
and when it is reasonably possible that a loss will be incurred or the amount of a loss will exceed the recorded provision. We regularly review
contingencies to determine whether the likelihood of loss has changed and to assess whether a reasonable estimate of the loss or range of loss can
be made. See Note 24 for further information.

OTHER ITEMS
INSURANCE. The run-off insurance operations of North American Life and Health (NALH) primarily include Employers Reassurance Corporation
(ERAC) and Union Fidelity Life Insurance Company (UFLIC). ERAC primarily assumes long-term care insurance and life insurance from numerous
cedents under various types of reinsurance treaties and stopped accepting new policies after 2008. UFLIC primarily assumes long-term care
insurance, structured settlement annuities with and without life contingencies and variable annuities from Genworth Financial Inc. (Genworth) and has
been closed to new business since 2004. Our run-off insurance liabilities and annuity benefits primarily comprise a liability for future policy benefits for
those insurance contract claims not yet incurred and claim reserves for claims that have been incurred. We regularly monitor emerging experience in
our run-off insurance operations and industry developments to identify trends that may help us refine our reserve assumptions.

Key Portfolio Characteristics
Long-term care insurance contracts. The long-term care insurance contracts we reinsure provide coverage at varying levels of benefits to policyholders
and may include attributes (e.g., lifetime benefit periods, inflation protection options, and joint life policies) that could result in claimants being on claim
for longer periods or at higher daily claim costs, or alternatively limiting the premium paying period, compared to contracts with a lower level of
benefits.

Structured settlement annuities and life insurance contracts. We reinsure approximately 26,000 structured settlement annuities with an average
attained age of 55. These structured settlement annuities were primarily underwritten on impaired lives (i.e., shorter-than- average life expectancies) at
origination and have projected payments extending decades into the future. Our primary risks associated with these contracts include mortality (i.e., life
expectancy or longevity), mortality improvement (i.e., assumed rate that mortality is expected to reduce over time), which may extend the duration of
payments on life contingent contracts beyond our estimates, and reinvestment risk (i.e., a low interest rate environment may reduce our ability to
achieve our targeted investment margins). Unlike long- term care insurance, structured settlement annuities offer no ability to require additional
premiums or reduce benefits.

Our life reinsurance business typically covers the mortality risk associated with various types of life insurance policies that we reinsure from
approximately 150 ceding company relationships where we pay a benefit based on the death of a covered life. As of December 31, 2022, across our
U.S. and Canadian life insurance blocks, we reinsure approximately $59 billion of net amount at risk (i.e., difference between the death benefit and any
accrued cash value) from approximately 1.4 million policies with an average attained age of 61. In 2022, our incurred claims were approximately $0.5
billion with an average individual claim of approximately $46,000. The covered products primarily include permanent life insurance and 20- and 30-year
level term insurance. We anticipate a significant portion of the 20-year level term policies, which represent approximately 17% of the net amount of
risk, to lapse through 2024 as the policies reach the end of their 20-year level premium period.

Critical Accounting Estimates. Our insurance reserves include the following key accounting estimates and assumptions described below.

Future policy benefit reserves. Future policy benefit reserves represent the present value of future policy benefits less the present value of future gross
premiums based on actuarial assumptions including, but not limited to, those discussed in Premium Deficiency Testing below. Assumptions are locked-
in throughout the remaining life of a contract unless a premium deficiency develops.

Claim reserves. Claim reserves are established when a claim is incurred and represents our best estimate of the present value of the ultimate
obligations for future claim payments and claim adjustment expenses. Key inputs include actual known facts about the claim, such as the benefits
available and cause of disability of the claimant, as well as assumptions derived from our actual historical experience and expected future changes in
experience factors. Claim reserves are evaluated periodically for potential changes in loss estimates with the support of qualified actuaries, and any
changes are recorded in earnings in the period in which they are determined.

Premium Deficiency Testing. We annually perform premium deficiency testing in the third quarter in the aggregate across our run-off insurance
portfolio. The premium deficiency testing assesses the adequacy of future policy benefit reserves, net of unamortized capitalized acquisition costs,
using current assumptions without provision for adverse deviation. A comprehensive review of premium deficiency assumptions is a complex process
and depends on a number of factors, many of which are interdependent and require evaluation individually and in the aggregate across all insurance
products. The vast majority of our run-off insurance operations consists of reinsurance from multiple ceding insurance entities pursuant to treaties
having complex terms and conditions. Premium deficiency testing relies on claim and policy information provided by these ceding entities and
considers the reinsurance treaties and underlying policies. In order to utilize that information for purposes of completing experience studies covering all
key assumptions, we perform detailed procedures to conform and validate the data received from the ceding entities. Our long-term care insurance
business includes coverage where credible claim experience for higher attained ages is still emerging, and to the extent future experience deviates
from current expectations, new projections of claim costs extending over the expected life of the policies may be required. Significant uncertainties
exist in making projections for these long-term care insurance contracts, which requires that we consider a wide range of possible outcomes.


                                                                                                                                           2022 FORM 10-K 23
The primary assumptions used in the premium deficiency tests include:

Morbidity. Morbidity assumptions used in estimating future policy benefit reserves are based on estimates of expected incidences of disability among
policyholders and the costs associated with these policyholders asserting claims under their contracts, and these estimates account for any expected
future morbidity improvement. For long-term care exposures, estimating expected future costs includes assessments of incidence (probability of a
claim), utilization (amount of available benefits expected to be incurred) and continuance (how long the claim will last).

Rate of Change in Morbidity. Our annual premium deficiency testing incorporates our best estimates of projected future changes in the morbidity rates
reflected in our base claim cost curves. These estimates draw upon a number of inputs, some of which are subjective, and all of which are interpreted
and applied in the exercise of professional actuarial judgment in the context of the characteristics specific to our portfolios. This exercise of judgment
considers factors such as the work performed by internal and external independent actuarial experts engaged to advise us in our annual testing, the
observed actual experience in our portfolios measured against our base projections, industry developments, and other trends, including advances in
the state of medical care and health-care technology development.

Mortality. Mortality assumptions used in estimating future policy benefit reserves are based on published mortality tables as adjusted for the results of
our experience studies and estimates of expected future mortality improvement.

Discount rate. Interest rate assumptions used in estimating the present value of future policy benefit reserves are based on expected future investment
yields, net of related investment expenses and expected defaults. In estimating future investment yields, we consider the actual yields on our current
investment securities held by our run-off insurance operations and the future rates at which we expect to reinvest any proceeds from investment
security maturities, net of other operating cash flows, and the projected future capital contributions into our run-off insurance operations.

Future long-term care premium rate increases. Long-term care insurance policies allow the issuing insurance entity to increase premiums, or
alternatively allow the policyholder the option to decrease benefits, with approval by state regulators, should actual experience emerge worse than
what was projected when such policies were initially underwritten. As a reinsurer, we rely upon the primary insurers that issued the underlying policies
to file proposed premium rate increases on those policies with the relevant state insurance regulators. While we have no direct ability to seek or to
institute such premium rate increases, we often collaborate with the primary insurers in accordance with reinsurance contractual terms to file proposed
premium rate increases. The amount of times that rate increases have occurred varies by ceding company. We consider recent experience of rate
increase filings made by our ceding companies along with state insurance regulatory processes and precedents in establishing our current
expectations.

Terminations. Terminations refers to the rate at which the underlying policies are cancelled due to either mortality, lapse (non-payment of premiums by
a policyholder), or, in the case of long-term care insurance, benefit exhaustion. Termination rate assumptions used in estimating the present value of
future policy benefit reserves are based on the results of our experience studies and reflect actuarial judgment.

2022 Premium Deficiency Testing. We completed our annual premium deficiency testing in the aggregate across our run-off insurance portfolio in the
third quarter of 2022. These procedures included updating certain experience studies since our last test completed in the third quarter of 2021,
independent actuarial analysis (principally on long-term care insurance exposures) and review of industry benchmarks. Using updated assumptions,
the 2022 premium deficiency testing results indicated a positive margin of about 10% of the related future policy benefit reserves recorded at
September 30, 2022, or approximately equivalent to the 2021 premium deficiency testing results.

GAAP Reserve Sensitivities. The following table provides sensitivities with respect to the impact of changes of key assumptions underlying our 2022
premium deficiency testing, exclusive of the impacts of converting our long-term care insurance claim cost projection models to first principles models
as the conversion remains incomplete at the time of our 2022 premium deficiency testing. Many of our assumptions are interdependent and require
evaluation individually and in the aggregate across all insurance products. Small changes in the amounts used in the sensitivities could result in
materially different outcomes from those reflected below.

While higher assumed inflation, holding all other assumptions constant, would result in unfavorable impacts to the projected present value of future
cash flows, it would be expected to be mitigated by a higher discount rate and more policies reaching contractual daily or monthly benefit caps.

Our run-off insurance subsidiaries are required to prepare statutory financial statements in accordance with statutory accounting practices. Statutory
accounting practices are set forth by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) as well as state laws, regulation and general
administrative rules and differ in certain respects from GAAP and would result in several of the sensitivities described in the table above being less
impactful on our statutory reserves.

See Capital Resources and Liquidity, Other Items - New Accounting Standards and Notes 3 and 12 for further information related to our run-off
insurance operations.

NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS. The Financial Accounting Standards Board issued new guidance on accounting for long-duration insurance
contracts that is effective for our interim and annual periods beginning January 1, 2023 and applied retrospectively to January 1, 2021 (i.e., the
transition date). We will adopt the new guidance using the modified retrospective transition method where permitted. We expect adoption of the new
guidance will significantly change the accounting for measurements of our long-duration insurance liabilities and reinsurance recoverables and
materially affect our consolidated financial statements and require changes to our actuarial, accounting and financial reporting processes, systems,
and internal controls. The new guidance requires cash flow assumptions used in the measurement of various insurance liabilities to be reviewed at
least annually and updated if actual experience or other evidence indicates previous assumptions warrant revision with any required changes recorded
in earnings. These changes will result in the elimination of premium deficiency testing and shadow adjustments. Under the new guidance, the discount
rate will be equivalent to the upper-medium grade (i.e., single A) fixed-income instrument yield reflecting the duration characteristics of our insurance
liabilities and is required to be updated in each reporting period with changes recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI). As
reinsurance recoverables are recognized in a manner consistent with the liabilities relating to the underlying reinsurance contracts, changes in
reinsurance recoverables from updating the single A discount rate in each reporting period are also recognized in AOCI. The allowance for credit
losses on reinsurance recoverables will continue to be based on the locked-in discount rate for purposes of assessing changes in each reporting
period. As such, movements in the gross reinsurance recoverable balance resulting from changes in the single A discount rate will not impact the
allowance for credit losses. Following the recapture transaction effective in the fourth quarter of 2022, as explained in Note 12, the remaining
reinsurance recoverables are not material.

In conjunction with the adoption of the new guidance, we are in process of converting our long-term care insurance claim cost projection models to first
principles models that are based on more granular assumptions of expected future experience and will facilitate the new guidance's requirements.

We currently estimate a decrease in Shareholders’ equity at the transition date from adoption of the new guidance to be in an after-tax range of $7.0
billion to $8.0 billion, including approximately $5.5 billion to $6.0 billion in AOCI and $1.5 billion to $2.0 billion in Retained earnings. The decrease in
AOCI is primarily attributable to remeasuring our insurance liabilities and reinsurance recoverables using the single A discount rate required under the
new guidance, which is lower than our current locked-in discount rate, and the removal of shadow adjustments. The decrease in Retained earnings at
the transition date is primarily attributable to certain long-term care insurance exposures where the projected present value of future cash flows
exceeds the reserves at the transition date, based on the required lower level of grouping of contracts, combined with converting our long-term care
insurance claim cost projection models to first principles models. As of December 31, 2022, we estimate the decrease in Shareholders' equity to be
reduced to approximately $3.0 billion to $4.0 billion, primarily due to changes in the market interest rate environment subsequent to the transition date.

The new guidance is only applicable to the measurements of our long-duration insurance liabilities under GAAP. In addition, we do not expect changes
to statutory insurance reserves, regulatory capital requirements or projected funding as a result of the implementation of the first principles models.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES. We believe that presenting non-GAAP financial measures provides management and investors useful
measures to evaluate performance and trends of the total company and its businesses. This includes adjustments in recent periods to GAAP financial
measures to increase period-to-period comparability following actions to strengthen our overall financial position and how we manage our business. In
addition, management recognizes that certain non-GAAP terms may be interpreted differently by other companies under different circumstances. In
various sections of this report we have made reference to the following non-GAAP financial measures in describing our (1) revenues, specifically
organic revenues by segment; organic revenues; and equipment and services organic revenues and (2) profit, specifically organic profit and profit
margin by segment; Adjusted profit and profit margin; Adjusted organic profit and profit margin; Adjusted earnings (loss); Adjusted income tax rate; and
Adjusted earnings (loss) per share (EPS). The reasons we use these non-GAAP financial measures and the reconciliations to their most directly
comparable GAAP financial measures follow.

We believe that adjusting profit to exclude the effects of items that are not closely associated with ongoing operations provides management and
investors with a meaningful measure that increases the period-to-period comparability. Gains (losses) and restructuring and other items are impacted
by the timing and magnitude of gains associated with dispositions, and the timing and magnitude of costs associated with restructuring and other
activities.

(a) Included foreign currency negative effect on revenues of $2,079 million and positive effect on operating costs and other income (loss) of $1,975
    million for the year ended December 31, 2022.
We believe this measure provides management and investors with a more complete understanding of underlying operating results and trends of
established, ongoing operations by excluding the effect of acquisitions, dispositions and foreign currency, which includes translational and
transactional impacts, as these activities can obscure underlying trends.

(b) Includes tax benefits available to offset the tax on gains (losses) on equity securities.
(c) Includes related tax valuation allowances.
Earnings-per-share amounts are computed independently. As a result, the sum of per-share amounts may not equal the total.
The service cost for our pension and other benefit plans are included in Adjusted earnings*, which represents the ongoing cost of providing pension
benefits to our employees. The components of non-operating benefit costs are mainly driven by capital allocation decisions and market performance.
We believe the retained costs in Adjusted earnings* and the Adjusted income tax rate* provides management and investors a useful measure to
evaluate the performance of the total company and increases period-to-period comparability.

The annual changes for the five-year period shown in the above graph are based on the assumption that $100 had been invested in General Electric
common stock, the Standard & Poor’s 500 Stock Index (S&P 500) and the Standard & Poor’s 500 Industrials Stock Index (S&P Industrial) on

RISK FACTORS. The following discussion of the material factors, events and uncertainties that may make an investment in the Company
speculative or risky contains "forward-looking statements," as discussed in the Forward-Looking Statements section. These risk factors may be
important to understanding any statement in this Form 10-K report or elsewhere. The risks described below should not be considered a complete list of
potential risks that we face, and additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial may also negatively impact us. The
following information should be read in conjunction with the MD&A section and the consolidated financial statements and related notes. The risks we
describe in this Form 10-K report or in our other SEC filings could, in ways we may not be able to accurately predict, recognize or control, have a
material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial position, results of operations, cash flows and stock price, and they could cause our
future results to be materially different than we presently anticipate.

STRATEGIC RISKS. Strategic risk relates to the Company's future business plans and strategies, including the risks associated with: our strategic
plan to separate into three public companies; the global macro-environment; the global energy transition; competitive threats, the demand for our
products and services and the success of our investments in technology and innovation; our portfolio of businesses and capital allocation decisions;
dispositions, acquisitions, joint ventures and restructuring activity; intellectual property; and other risks.




2022 FORM 10-K 30
Strategic plan - We may encounter challenges to executing our plan to separate GE into three public companies, or to completing the plan
within the timeframes we anticipate, and we may not realize some or all of the expected benefits of the separations. In November 2021, we
announced our plan to form three independent public companies from our (i) Aerospace business, (ii) HealthCare business and (iii) portfolio of energy
businesses that we plan to combine as GE Vernova (Renewable Energy, Power, Digital and Energy Financial Services), to better position those
businesses to deliver long-term growth and create value for customers, investors, and employees. In January 2023, our HealthCare business was
spun off as GE HealthCare. The GE HealthCare business separation was, and the planned GE Vernova business separation is expected to be,
effected through spin-offs by GE that are intended to be tax-free for the Company and its shareholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes and with
all three resulting companies having investment grade credit ratings. The GE Vernova separation transaction will be subject to the satisfaction of a
number of customary conditions, including, among others, final approvals by GE’s Board of Directors, receipt of tax rulings in certain jurisdictions
and/or tax opinions from external counsel, the filing with the SEC and effectiveness of a Form 10 registration statement, and establishment of the
capital structures and credit ratings for both GE Vernova and the remainder of GE following the spin-off. A failure to satisfy required conditions, or
disruptions in market conditions, could delay the completion of the GE Vernova separation transaction for a significant period of time or prevent it from
occurring at all. Additionally, the GE Vernova separation transaction is complex in nature, and business, market or other developments or changes may
affect our ability to complete the separation transaction as currently expected, within the anticipated timeframe or at all. These or other developments
could cause us not to realize some or all of the expected benefits, or to realize them on a different timeline than expected. If we are unable to complete
the GE Vernova separation, we will have incurred costs without realizing the benefits of such transaction. In addition, the terms and conditions of the
required regulatory authorizations and consents that are granted, if any, may impose requirements, limitations or costs, or place restrictions on the
conduct of GE Vernova or GE Aerospace as independent companies. In addition, although we intend for the GE Vernova separation transaction to be
tax-free to the Company and its shareholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we expect to incur non-U.S. cash taxes on the preparatory
restructuring and may also incur non-cash tax expense including potential impairments of deferred tax assets. Moreover, there can be no assurance
that either of the separation transactions will qualify as tax-free for U.S. purposes for the Company or its shareholders. If either of the separation
transactions were ultimately determined to be taxable, we would incur a significant tax liability, while the distributions to the Company’s shareholders
would become taxable and the new independent companies might incur income tax liabilities as well. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that
each separate company will be successful as a standalone public company.

Whether or not the GE Vernova separation transaction is completed, our businesses may face material challenges as a result of the GE HealthCare
separation and in connection with the GE Vernova separation, including the diversion of management’s attention from ongoing business concerns and
impact on the businesses of the Company; appropriately allocating assets and liabilities among GE Aerospace and GE Vernova; maintaining employee
morale and retaining and attracting key management and other employees; retaining existing or attracting new business and operational relationships,
including with customers, suppliers, employees and other counterparties; assigning customer contracts, guaranties and other contracts and
instruments to each of the businesses, and obtaining releases from the counterparties to those contracts or beneficiaries of those instruments;
providing financial or credit support for new business; assigning intellectual property to each of the businesses; establishing transition service
agreements and standalone readiness for key functions; and potential negative reactions from investors or the financial community. In particular, GE
for the past several years has been undertaking various restructuring and business transformation actions (including workforce reductions, global
facility consolidations and other cost reduction initiatives, and the GE HealthCare separation) that have entailed changes across our organizational
structure, senior leadership, culture, functional alignment, outsourcing and other areas. These pose risks in the form of personnel capacity constraints
and institutional knowledge loss that could lead to missed performance or financial targets, loss of key personnel and harm to our reputation, and these
risks are heightened with the additional interdependent actions that will be needed to complete the planned separation of GE Vernova.

Moreover, completion of the GE HealthCare separation has resulted, and completion of the GE Vernova separation will result in independent public
companies that are smaller, less diversified companies with more limited businesses concentrated in their respective industries than GE was prior to
the separation transactions. As a result, each company may be more vulnerable to global economic trends, geopolitical risks, demand or supply
shocks, and changing market conditions, which could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, cash flows and results of
operations. In addition, the diversification of revenues, costs, and cash flows will diminish, such that each company’s results of operations, cash flows,
working capital, effective tax rate, and financing requirements may be subject to increased volatility and its ability to execute of capital allocation plans,
fund capital expenditures and investments, pay dividends and meet debt obligations and other liabilities may be diminished. Each of the separate
companies will also incur ongoing costs, including costs of operating as independent public companies, that the separated businesses will no longer be
able to share. Additionally, we cannot predict whether the market value of our common stock and the common stock of each of the new independent
companies after the separation transactions will be, in the aggregate, less than, equal to or greater than the market value of our common stock prior to
the separation transactions. Investors holding our common stock may also sell the common stock of any of the new independent companies that do
not match their investment strategies, which may cause a decline in the market price of such common stock. Any decline in the market price of GE
HealthCare common stock will also affect the value of our retained equity ownership in that company and could affect the timing and tax treatment of
our disposition of that stake.

Global macro-environment - Our growth is subject to global economic, political and geopolitical risks. We operate in virtually every part of the
world, serve customers in over 170 countries and received 57% of our revenues for 2022 from outside the United States. Our operations and the
execution of our business plans and strategies are subject to the effects of global economic trends, geopolitical risks and demand or supply shocks
from events such as war or international conflict, a major terrorist attack, natural disasters or actual or threatened public health emergencies (such as
COVID-19, including virus variants and resurgences and responses to those). They are also affected by local and regional economic environments,
supply chain constraints and policies in the U.S. and other markets that we serve, including factors such as continuing inflationary pressures in many
markets, continuing increases in interest rates from recent historic lows, economic growth rates, the availability of skilled labor, monetary policy,
exchange rates and



                                                                                                                                          2022 FORM 10-K 31
currency volatility, commodity prices and sovereign debt levels. For example, ongoing inflationary pressures have caused and may continue to cause
many of our material and labor costs to increase, which can adversely affect our profitability and cash flows, particularly when we are unable to
increase customer contract values or pricing to offset those pressures. At the same time, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and related political and
economic consequences, such as sanctions and other measures imposed by the European Union, the U.S. and other countries and organizations in
response, have also caused and may continue to cause disruption and instability in global markets, supply chains and industries that negatively impact
our businesses, financial condition and results of operations and pose reputational risks. Further deterioration of economic conditions or outlooks, such
as lower rates of investment, lower economic growth, recession or fears of recession in the U.S., China, Europe or other key markets, may adversely
affect the demand for or profitability of our products and services, and the impact from developments outside the U.S. on our business performance
can be significant given the extent of our global activities. In addition, political changes and trends such as populism, protectionism, economic
nationalism and sentiment toward multinational companies, as well as tariffs, export controls, restrictions on outbound investment or other trade
barriers, sanctions, technical or local content regulations, currency controls, or changes to tax or other laws and policies, have been and may continue
to be disruptive and costly to our businesses. These can interfere with our global operating model, supply chain, production costs, customer
relationships and competitive position. Further escalation of any specific trade tensions, including intensified decoupling between the U.S. and China,
or in global trade conflict more broadly could be harmful to global economic growth or to our business in or with China or other countries. We also do
business in many emerging market jurisdictions where economic, political and legal risks are heightened and the operating environments are complex.

COVID-19 - The global COVID-19 pandemic has had and may continue to have a material adverse impact on our operations and financial
performance, as well as on the operations and financial performance of many of the customers and suppliers in industries that we serve,
particularly for our Aerospace business. Our operations and financial performance since early 2020 have been negatively impacted by the
COVID-19 pandemic that has caused, and may continue to cause, a slowdown of economic activity (including the decrease in demand for a broad
variety of goods and services), disruptions in global supply chains and significant volatility and disruption of financial markets. While there has been
recovery in many business sectors compared to the initial years of the pandemic, virus resurgences and variants, regional or site lockdowns and
similar dynamics may continue to cause operational challenges at our facilities or with customers or suppliers and adversely affect our business and
financial performance. In particular, our Aerospace business constitutes a substantial portion of our financial results, and accordingly the adverse
impacts that COVID-19 has had and may continue to have on commercial air traffic and operators, airlines, airframers, lessors, suppliers and other
actors in the aviation sector more broadly are significant for GE. Interruptions of regional and international air travel from COVID-19 have had a
material adverse effect on our airline and airframer customers and their demand for our services and products, and in some cases may threaten the
future viability of some customers. Industry participants’ measures in response to these dynamics could lead to future requests for payment deferrals,
contract modifications, and similar actions across the aviation sector, which may lead to additional charges, impairments and other adverse financial
impacts, or to customer disputes. There are also risks related to longer-term strategies the aviation industry may implement, such as reducing capacity,
shifting route patterns or other strategies to mitigate impacts from COVID-19 and the risk of future public health crises, and from potential shifts in the
flying public’s demand for travel, any of which could adversely affect the pace of recovery in commercial air traffic capacity and the demand for or
profitability of our products and services. The continuing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations and financial performance depends on
many factors that are not within our control, including, but not limited, to: the severity and duration of the COVID-19 outbreaks around the world;
governmental, business and individuals’ actions that have been and continue to be taken in response to the pandemic (including regional lockdowns,
restrictions on travel and transport or changes such as China’s recent reversal of its zero-COVID policy); the impact of the pandemic and actions taken
in response on global and regional economies, travel, and economic activity; the availability, public acceptance and continued efficacy of treatments or
vaccines; and the pace and extent of recovery from the past and any future adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Impacts and risks related to
the COVID-19 pandemic may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risk factors described in this section.

Energy transition - The strategic priorities and financial performance of many of our businesses are subject to market and other dynamics
related to decarbonization, which can pose risks in addition to opportunities. Given the nature of our businesses and the industries we serve, we
must anticipate and respond to market, technological, regulatory and other changes driven by broader trends related to decarbonization efforts in
response to climate change and energy security. These changes present both risks and opportunities for our businesses, many of which provide
products and services to customers in sectors like power generation and commercial aviation that have historically been carbon intensive and we
expect will remain important to efforts globally to lower greenhouse gas emissions for decades to come. For example, the significant decreases in
recent years in the levelized cost of energy for renewable sources of power generation (such as wind and solar), along with ongoing changes in
government, investor, customer and consumer policies, commitments, preferences and considerations related to climate change, in some cases have
adversely affected, and may continue to affect, the demand for and the competitiveness of products and services related to fossil fuel-based power
generation, including sales of new gas turbines and the utilization and servicing needs for existing gas power plants that are unmitigated with
capabilities such as hydrogen or carbon capture. Continued shifts toward greater penetration by renewables in both new capacity additions and the
proportionate share of power generation, particularly depending on the pace and timeframe for such shifts across different markets globally, could have
a material adverse effect on the performance of our Power business and our consolidated results. While the currently anticipated market growth and
power generation share for renewable energy is expected to be favorable for our wind businesses over time, we face uncertainties related to future
levels and timeframes of government subsidies and credits (including the impact of the Inflation Reduction Act and other policies), significant price
competition among wind equipment manufacturers, changing dynamics between onshore and offshore wind power, potential further consolidation in
the wind industry, competition with solar power-based and other sources of renewable energy and the pace at which power grids are modernized to
maintain reliability with higher levels of renewables penetration. The achievement of deep decarbonization goals for the power sector over the coming
decades is likely to depend in part on technologies that are not yet deployed or widely adopted today but that may become more important over time
(such as hydrogen-based power generation, carbon capture and sequestration technologies, small modular or other advanced nuclear power and grid-
scale batteries or other storage solutions). Successfully navigating these changes



2022 FORM 10-K 32
will require significant investments in power grids and other infrastructure, research and development and new technology and products, both by GE
and third parties. Similar dynamics exist in the aviation sector, where decarbonization over time will require a combination of continued technological
innovation in the fuel efficiency of engines, expanded use of sustainable aviation fuels and the development of electric flight and hydrogen-based
aviation technologies. For example, the risk of insufficient availability of low carbon fuels (such as sustainable aviation fuels or hydrogen) may
compromise the pace and degree of decarbonization within the aviation sector. Our success in advancing decarbonization objectives across our
businesses will depend in part on the actions of governments, regulators and other market participants to invest in infrastructure, create appropriate
market incentives and to otherwise support the development of new technologies. The process of developing new high-technology products and
enhancing existing products to mitigate climate change is often complex, costly and uncertain, and we may pursue strategies or make investments that
do not prove to be commercially successful in the time frames expected or at all.

A failure by GE or other industry participants to invest successfully in these technological developments, or to adequately position our businesses to
benefit from the growth in adoption of new technologies, could adversely affect our competitive position, business, ability to attract and retain talent,
results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. In addition, we face increasing scrutiny and expectations from many customers, governments,
regulators, investors, banks, project financiers and other stakeholders regarding the roles that the private sector and individual companies play in
decarbonization, which can result in additional costs and pose reputational or other risks for companies like GE that serve carbon intensive industries
or relative to progress that we make over time in reducing emissions from our operations or products and achieving our publicly announced ambitions.
We anticipate that we will continue to need to make investments in new technologies and capabilities and devote additional management and other
resources in response to the foregoing, and we may not realize the anticipated benefits of those investments and actions. Trends related to the global
energy transition and decarbonization, will affect the relative competitiveness of different types of product and service offerings within and across our
energy businesses and our Aerospace business. Important factors that could impact our businesses include the pace of technological developments
and related cost considerations, the levels of economic growth in different markets around the world and the adoption and pace of implementation of
climate change-related policies (such as carbon taxes, cap and trade regimes, increased efficiency standards, greenhouse gas emission reduction
targets or commitments, incentives or mandates for particular types of energy or policies that impact the availability of financing for certain types of
projects) at the national and sub-national levels or by customers, investors or other private actors.

Competitive environment - We are dependent on the maintenance of existing product lines and service relationships, market acceptance of
new product and service introductions, and technology and innovation leadership for revenue and earnings growth. The markets in which we
operate are highly competitive in terms of pricing, product and service quality, product development and introduction time, customer service, financing
terms, the ability to respond to shifts in market demand and the ability to attract and retain skilled talent. Our long-term operating results and
competitive position also depend substantially upon our ability to continually develop, introduce, and market new and innovative technology, products,
services and platforms, to develop digital solutions for our own operations and our customers, to modify existing products and services, to customize
products and services, to maintain long-term customer relationships and to increase our productivity over time as we perform on long-term service
agreements. We often enter into long-term service agreements in both our Aerospace and Power businesses in connection with significant contracts
for the sale of equipment. In connection with these agreements, we must accurately estimate our costs associated with delivering the products, product
durability and reliability, and the provision of services over time in order to be profitable and generate acceptable returns on our investments. A failure
to appropriately estimate or plan for or execute our business plans may adversely affect our delivery of products, services and outcomes in line with
our projected financial performance or cost estimates, and ultimately may result in excess costs, build-up of inventory that becomes obsolete, lower
profit margins and an erosion of our competitive position. In addition, at our Renewable Energy business, the rapid pace of innovation among onshore
and offshore wind turbine manufacturers in recent years has led to short product cycles, early market introductions and faster time to market, all of
which can lead to quality and execution issues, higher costs and other challenges to achieving profitability for new products.

Our businesses are also subject to technological change and advances, such as growth in industrial automation and increased digitization of the
operations, infrastructure and solutions that customers demand across all the industries we serve. The introduction of innovative and disruptive
technologies in the markets in which we operate also poses risks in the form of new competitors (including new entrants from outside our traditional
industries, such as competitors from digital technology companies), market consolidation, substitutions of existing products, services or solutions,
niche players, new business models and competitors that are faster to market with new or more cost-effective products or services. Existing and new
competitors frequently offer services for our installed base, and if the customers that purchase our equipment and products select our competitors’
services of if we otherwise fail to maintain or renew service relationships, this can erode the revenues and profitability of our businesses. In addition,
the research and development cycle involved in bringing products in our businesses to market is often lengthy, it is inherently difficult to predict the
economic conditions or competitive dynamics that will exist when any new product is complete, and our investments, to the extent they result in
bringing a product to market, may generate weaker returns than we anticipated at the outset. Our capacity to invest in research and development
efforts to pursue advancement in a wide range of technologies, products and services also depends on the financial resources that we have available
for such investment relative to other capital allocation priorities. Under-investment in research and development, or investment in technologies that
prove to be less competitive in the future (at the expense of alternative investment opportunities not pursued), could lead to loss of sales of our
products and services in the future, particularly in our long-cycle businesses that have longer product development cycles. The amounts that we do
invest in research and development efforts may not lead to the development of new technologies or products on a timely basis or meet the needs of
our customers as fully as competitive offerings.

Business portfolio - Our success depends on achieving our strategic and financial objectives, including through acquisitions, integrations,
dispositions and joint ventures. With respect to acquisitions and business integrations or with dispositions, separations, such as the spin-off of GE
HealthCare, and joint ventures, we may not achieve expected returns or other benefits on a timely basis or at all as a result of changes in strategy,
integration challenges or other factors. Over the past several years we have also



                                                                                                                                        2022 FORM 10-K 33
been pursuing a variety of dispositions, and we plan to exit our equity interests in AerCap and GE HealthCare over time. Declines in the values of
equity interests (such as our interests AerCap and GE HealthCare) or other assets (such as the AerCap senior notes that we hold) that we sell can
diminish the cash proceeds that we realize, and our ability and timing to sell can depend on the liquidity of the relevant asset and other market
conditions. We may dispose of businesses or assets at a price or on terms that are less favorable than we had anticipated, or with purchase price
adjustments or the exclusion of assets or liabilities that must be divested, managed or run off separately. Dispositions or other business separations
also often involve continued financial involvement in the divested business, such as through continuing equity ownership, retained assets or liabilities,
transition services agreements, commercial agreements, guarantees, indemnities or other current or contingent financial obligations or liabilities. Under
these arrangements, performance by the divested businesses or other conditions outside our control could materially affect our future financial results.
Evaluating or executing on all types of potential or planned portfolio transactions can divert senior management time and resources from other
pursuits. We also participate in a number of joint ventures with other companies or government enterprises in various markets around the world,
including joint ventures where we have a lesser degree of control over the business operations, which expose us to additional operational, financial,
reputational, legal or compliance risks.

Intellectual property - Our intellectual property portfolio may not prevent competitors from independently developing products and services
similar to or duplicative to ours, and the value of our intellectual property may be negatively impacted by external dependencies. Our patents
and other intellectual property may not prevent competitors from independently developing or selling products and services similar to or duplicative of
ours, and there can be no assurance that the resources invested by us to protect our intellectual property will be sufficient or that our intellectual
property portfolio will adequately deter misappropriation or improper use of our technology, particularly in certain markets outside the US where
intellectual property laws and related enforcement mechanisms may not be as well-developed. Trademark licenses of the GE brand in connection with
dispositions may negatively impact the overall value of the brand in the future. We also face competition in some countries where we have not invested
in an intellectual property portfolio. If we are not able to protect our intellectual property, the value of our brand and other intangible assets may be
diminished, and our business may be adversely affected. We also face attempts, both internally from insider threats and externally from cyber-attacks,
to gain unauthorized access to our IT systems or products for the purpose of improperly acquiring our trade secrets or confidential business
information. In addition, we have observed an increase in the use of social engineering tactics by bad actors attempting to obtain confidential business
information or credentials to access systems with our intellectual property. The theft or unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets and other
confidential business information as a result of such incidents could adversely affect our competitive position and the value of our investment in
research and development. In addition, we are subject to the enforcement of patents or other intellectual property by third parties, including aggressive
and opportunistic enforcement claims by non-practicing entities. Regardless of the merit of such claims, responding to infringement claims can be
expensive and time-consuming. GE has in the past, and may in the future be, found to infringe third-party rights, which could require us to pay
substantial damages or enjoin us from offering some of our products and services. The value of, or our ability to use, our intellectual property may also
be negatively impacted by dependencies on third parties, such as our ability to obtain or renew on reasonable terms licenses that we need in the
future, or our ability to secure or retain ownership or rights to use data in certain software analytics or services offerings.

OPERATIONAL RISKS. Operational risk relates to risks arising from systems, processes, people and external events that affect the operation of our
businesses. It includes risks related to product and service lifecycle and execution; product safety and performance; information management and data
protection and security, including cybersecurity; and supply chain and business disruption.

Operational execution - Operational challenges could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial position, results
of operations and cash flows. The Company’s financial results depend on the successful execution of our businesses’ operating plans across all
steps of the product and service lifecycle. We continue working to improve the operations and execution of our businesses and our ability to make the
desired improvements will be a significant factor in our overall financial performance. We also face operational risks in connection with launching or
ramping new product platforms, such as the Haliade-X offshore wind turbine or new onshore wind turbine models at Renewable Energy, or the LEAP
engine at Aerospace. Particularly with newer product platforms and technologies, our businesses seek to reduce the costs of these products over time
with experience, and risks related to our supply chain, the availability of skilled labor, product quality, timely delivery, liquidated damages or other
aspects of operational execution can adversely affect our ability to meet customers' expectations, profits and cash flows. Operational failures at any of
our businesses that result in quality problems or potential product, environmental, health or safety risks, could have a material adverse effect on our
business, reputation, financial position, cash flows and results of operations.

In addition, a portion of our business in recent years at our Power and Renewable Energy businesses involves large projects where we have taken on,
or are members of a consortium responsible for, the full scope of engineering, procurement, construction or other services. We have been increasing
our selectivity as to how frequently and with what scope of work we will participate in these types of projects, which often pose unique risks related to
their location, scale, complexity, duration and pricing or payment structure. Delivering on these types of projects with multiple parties and
subcontractors involved, particularly outside of mature markets in the U.S. and Europe, is highly complex with risks related to the safety and security of
workers, impacts on local communities, corruption, breach or theft of intellectual property and other factors. Performance issues or schedule delays
can arise due to inadequate technical expertise, unanticipated project modifications, developments at project sites, environmental, health and safety
issues, execution by or coordination with suppliers, subcontractors or consortium partners, financial difficulties of our customers or significant partners
or compliance with government regulations, and these can lead to cost overruns, contractual penalties, liquidated damages and other adverse
consequences. Where GE is a member of a consortium, we are typically subject to claims based on joint and several liability, and claims can extend to
aspects of the project or costs that are not directly related or limited to GE’s scope of work or over which GE does not have control. Operational, quality
or other issues at large projects, or across our projects portfolio more broadly, can adversely affect GE’s business, reputation, cash flows or results of
operations.

Product safety and quality - Our products and services are highly sophisticated and specialized, and a major failure or quality issue
affecting our products or third-party products with which our products are integrated can adversely affect our business, reputation,
financial position, results of operations and cash flows. We produce highly sophisticated products and provide specialized services for both our
own and third-party products that incorporate or use complex or leading-edge technology, including both hardware and software. Many of our products
and services involve complex industrial machinery or infrastructure projects, such as commercial jet engines, gas turbines, onshore and offshore wind
turbines or nuclear power generation, and accordingly the adverse impact of product quality issues can be significant. Actual or perceived design,
production, performance or other quality issues related to new product introductions or existing product lines can result in reputational harm to our
businesses, in addition to direct warranty, maintenance and other costs that may arise. For example, as discussed above, based on experience across
our Onshore Wind fleet, we are deploying repairs and other corrective measures to improve overall quality and fleet availability resulting in higher
warranty and related reserves. In addition, a catastrophic product failure or similar event resulting in injuries or death, widespread outages, a fleet
grounding or similar systemic consequences could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial position, cash flows and results
of operations. Even when there has not been a particularly significant or widespread product failures in the field, many of our products and services
must function under demanding operating conditions and meet exacting certification, performance and reliability standards that we, our customers or
regulators adopt. Developing and maintaining products that meet or exceed these can be costly and technologically challenging, and may also involve
extensive coordination of suppliers and highly skilled labor from thousands of workers; a failure to deliver products and services that meet these
standards could have significant adverse financial, competitive or reputational effects. In some circumstances we have also incurred and in the future
we may continue to incur increased costs, delayed payments or lost equipment or services revenue in connection with a significant issue with a third
party’s product with which our products are integrated, or if parts or other components that we incorporate in our products have defects or other quality
issues. There can be no assurance that the operational processes around product design, manufacture, performance and servicing that we or our
customers or other third parties have designed to meet rigorous quality standards will be sufficient to prevent us or our customers or other third parties
from experiencing operational process or product failures and other problems, including through manufacturing or design defects, process or other
failures of contractors or third-party suppliers, cyber-attacks or other intentional acts, software vulnerabilities or malicious software, that could result in
potential product, safety, quality, regulatory or environmental risks.

Cybersecurity - Increased cybersecurity requirements, vulnerabilities, threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime pose a
risk to our systems, networks, products, solutions, services and data. Increased global cybersecurity vulnerabilities, threats, computer viruses
and more sophisticated and targeted cyber-related attacks such as ransomware, as well as cybersecurity failures resulting from human error and
technological errors, pose a risk to the security of GE's and its customers', partners', suppliers' and third-party service providers' infrastructure,
products, systems and networks and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of GE's and its customers' data, as well as associated financial risks.
As the perpetrators of such attacks become more capable (including sophisticated state or state-affiliated actors), and as critical infrastructure is
increasingly becoming digitized, the risks in this area continue to grow. Bad actors have attempted and may continue to attempt to use our strategic
plan to separate into three separate companies as an opportunity to launch attacks or increase their number of attacks against GE’s network. A
significant cyber-related attack in one of our industries, such as an attack on power grids, power plants or commercial aircraft (even if such an attack
does not involve GE products, services or systems), could pose broader disruptions and adversely affect our business. We have also observed an
increase in third-party breaches and ransomware attacks at suppliers, service providers and software providers, and our efforts to mitigate adverse
effects on GE if this trend continues may not be successful in the future. The large number of suppliers that we work with requires significant effort for
the initial and ongoing verification of the effective implementation of cybersecurity requirements by suppliers. The increasing degree of
interconnectedness between GE and its partners, suppliers and customers also poses a risk to the security of GE’s network as well as the larger
ecosystem in which GE operates. There can be no assurance that our efforts to mitigate cybersecurity risks by employing a number of measures,
including employee training, monitoring and testing, performing security reviews and requiring business partners with connections to the GE network to
appropriately secure their information technology systems, and maintenance of protective systems and contingency plans, will be sufficient to prevent,
detect and limit the impact of cyber-related attacks, and we remain vulnerable to known or unknown threats.

In addition to existing risks from the integration of digital technologies into our business portfolio, the adoption of new technologies in the future may
also increase our exposure to cybersecurity breaches and failures. While we have developed secure development lifecycle design practices to secure
our software designs and connected products, an unknown vulnerability or compromise could potentially impact the security of GE’s software or
connected products and lead to the misuse or unintended use of our products, loss of GE intellectual property, misappropriation of sensitive,
confidential or personal data, safety risks or unavailability of equipment. We also have access to sensitive, confidential or personal data or information
in certain of our businesses that is subject to privacy and security laws, regulations or customer-imposed controls. Despite our use of reasonable and
appropriate controls to protect our systems and sensitive, confidential or personal data or information, we have vulnerability to security breaches, theft,
misplaced, lost or corrupted data, programming errors, employee errors and/or malfeasance (including misappropriation by departing employees) that
could potentially lead to material compromising of sensitive, confidential or personal data or information, improper use of our systems, software
solutions or networks, unauthorized access, use, disclosure, modification or destruction of or denial of access to information, defective products,
production downtimes and operational disruptions. In addition, while we require our suppliers to implement and maintain reasonable and appropriate
controls to protect information we provide to them, they may be the victim of a cyber-related attack that could lead to the compromise of the
Company’s intellectual property, personal data or other confidential information, or to production downtimes and operational disruptions that could have
an adverse effect on our ability to meet our commitments to customers. An unknown security vulnerability or malicious software embedded in a
supplier’s product that is later integrated into a GE product could lead to a vulnerability in the security of GE’s product or if used internally in the GE
network environment to a compromise of the GE network, which could potentially lead to the loss of information or operational disruptions. Data
privacy and protection laws are evolving, can vary significantly by country and present increasing compliance challenges, which increase our costs,
affect our competitiveness and can expose us to substantial fines or other penalties. In addition, a significant cyber-related attack could result in



                                                                                                                                           2022 FORM 10-K 35
other negative consequences, including damage to our reputation or competitiveness, remediation, increased digital infrastructure or other costs that
are not covered by insurance, litigation or regulatory action.

Supply chain - Significant raw material or other component shortages, supplier capacity constraints, supplier or customer production
disruptions, supplier quality and sourcing issues or price increases can increase our operating costs and adversely impact the competitive
positions of our products. Our reliance on third-party suppliers, contract manufacturers and service providers, and commodity markets to secure raw
materials, parts, components and sub-systems used in our products exposes us to volatility in the prices and availability of these materials, parts,
components, systems and services. As our supply chains extend into many different countries and regions around the world, we are also subject to
global economic and geopolitical dynamics and risks associated with exporting components manufactured in particular countries for incorporation into
finished products completed in other countries. We are operating in a supply-constrained environment and are facing, and may continue to face,
supply-chain shortages, inflationary pressures, shortages of skilled labor, transportation and logistics challenges and manufacturing disruptions that
impact our revenues, profitability and timeliness in fulfilling customer orders. We anticipate supply chain pressures across our businesses will continue
to challenge and adversely affect our operations and financial performance for some period of time. For example, successfully executing the significant
production ramp-up efforts at our Aerospace business in connection with both newer engine platforms such as the LEAP and the aviation sector’s
ongoing recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, depends in part on our suppliers having access to the materials and skilled labor they require and
making timely deliveries to us, as well as meeting the required quality and performance standards for commercial aviation. In addition, some of our
suppliers or their sub-suppliers are limited- or sole-source suppliers, and our ability to meet our obligations to customers depends on the performance,
product quality and stability of such suppliers. We also have internal dependencies on certain key GE manufacturing or other facilities. Disruptions in
deliveries, capacity constraints, production disruptions up- or down-stream, price increases, or decreased availability of raw materials or commodities,
including as a result of war, natural disasters (including the effects of climate change such as sea level rise, drought, flooding, wildfires and more
intense weather events), actual or threatened public health emergencies or other business continuity events, adversely affect our operations and,
depending on the length and severity of the disruption, can limit our ability to meet our commitments to customers or significantly impact our operating
profit or cash flows. Quality, capability, compliance and sourcing issues experienced by third-party providers can also adversely affect our costs,
margin rates and the quality and effectiveness of our products and services and result in liability and reputational harm; the harm to us could be
significant if, for example, a quality issue at a supplier or with components that we integrate into our products results in a widespread quality issue
across one of our product lines or our installed base of equipment. In addition, our suppliers may experience cyber-related attacks, as described
above, which could negatively impact their ability to meet their delivery obligations to us and in turn have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our
commitments to customers.

FINANCIAL RISKS. Financial risk relates to our ability to meet financial obligations and mitigate exposure to broad market risks, including funding and
liquidity risks, such as risk related to our credit ratings and our availability and cost of funding; credit risk; and volatility in foreign currency exchange
rates, interest rates and commodity prices. Liquidity risk refers to the potential inability to meet contractual or contingent financial obligations (whether
on- or off-balance sheet) as they arise, and could potentially impact our financial condition or overall safety and soundness. Credit risk is the risk of
financial loss arising from a customer or counterparty failure to meet its contractual obligations, and we face credit risk arising from both our industrial
businesses and from our remaining financial services operations.

Customers and counterparties - Global economic, industry-specific or other developments that weaken the financial condition or
soundness of significant customers, governments or other parties we deal with can adversely affect our business, results of operations and
cash flows. The business and operating results of our businesses have been, and will continue to be, affected by worldwide economic conditions,
including conditions in the air transportation, power generation, renewable energy and other industries we serve. Existing or potential customers may
delay or cancel plans to purchase our products and services, including large infrastructure projects, and may not be able to fulfill their obligations to us
in a timely fashion or at all as a result of business deterioration, cash flow shortages or difficulty obtaining financing for particular projects or due to
macroeconomic conditions, geopolitical disruptions, changes in law or other challenges affecting the strength of the global economy. The airline
industry, for example, is highly cyclical, and sustained economic growth and political stability in both developed and emerging markets are principal
factors underlying long-term air traffic growth; the current macroeconomic and geopolitical environment and the potential for recession pose risks to the
rate of that growth. Aviation industry activity is also particularly influenced by the actions of a small group of large original equipment manufacturers, as
well as large airlines in various geographies. We have significant business with, and credit exposure to, some of our largest aviation customers and
accordingly our Aerospace business performance can be adversely affected by challenges that individual customers or the industry faces related to
factors such as competition, the need for cost reduction, financial stability and soundness, and the availability of aircraft leasing and financing
alternatives, the satisfaction of certification or other regulatory requirements for aircraft in various jurisdictions, the retirement of older aircraft and other
dynamics affecting the original equipment and aftermarket service markets. As described above, the extended disruption of regional and international
air travel from the COVID-19 pandemic has had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on our airframer and airline customers and
suppliers. A potential future disruption in connection with a terrorist incident, cyberattack, actual or threatened public health emergency or recessionary
economic environment that results in the loss of business and leisure traffic could also adversely affect these customers, their ability to fulfill their
obligations to us in a timely fashion or at all, demand for our products and services and the viability of a customer’s business. In our Power and
Renewable Energy businesses, our customers also face a variety of challenges, including in connection with decarbonization, industry consolidation,
competition and shifts in the availability of financing for certain types of power projects or technologies (such as prohibitions on financing for fossil fuel-
based projects or technologies); these dynamics can also have a significant impact on the operating results and outlooks for our businesses. In
addition, our customers include numerous governmental entities within and outside the U.S., including the U.S. federal government and state and local
entities. We also at times face greater challenges collecting on receivables with customers that are sovereign governments or located in emerging
markets. If there is significant deterioration in the global economy, in our industries, in financial markets or with particular significant counterparties, our
results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.




2022 FORM 10-K 36
Borrowings - We may face risks related to our debt levels, particularly if we face severely adverse market conditions. We have significantly
reduced our debt levels over the past several years through debt tenders and other liability management actions, and we expect to allocate additional
capital to debt reduction in the future, with cash flows from operations and the proceeds from asset sales and dispositions (including our stakes in
AerCap and GE HealthCare) as sources for that. If we are unable to generate cash flows in accordance with our plans, our deleveraging plan could be
delayed or altered, which may require that we delay investments or capital expenditures. We may be required to adopt one or more alternatives such
as increasing borrowing under credit lines, reducing or delaying investments or capital expenditures or taking other actions. In addition, we have
significant pension and run-off insurance liabilities that are sensitive to numerous factors and assumptions that we use in our pension liability, GAAP
insurance reserve and statutory insurance calculations. Our debt levels could put us at a competitive disadvantage compared to competitors with lower
debt levels that may provide them with greater financial flexibility to secure additional funding for their operations, pursue strategic acquisitions, finance
long-term projects or take other actions. Significant debt levels could also pose risks in the event of recession or adverse industry-specific conditions.
In addition, elevated debt may limit our ability to obtain new debt financing on favorable terms or at all in the future, particularly if coupled with
downgrades of our credit ratings or a deterioration of capital markets conditions more generally.

Liquidity - Failure to meet our cash flow targets, or additional credit downgrades, could adversely affect our liquidity, funding costs and
related margins. We rely primarily on cash and cash equivalents, free cash flows from our operating businesses and cash generated from asset sales
and dispositions (including from our equity stakes in AerCap and GE HealthCare) to fund our operations and meet our financial obligations, and to
meet our capital allocation objectives. We maintain short-term borrowing facilities, including revolving credit facilities, as a contingency buffer of
liquidity and to meet our financial obligations and capital allocation priorities. Failure to meet our cash flow objectives could adversely affect our
financial condition or our credit ratings. There can be no assurance that we will not face credit downgrades as a result of factors such as the
performance of our businesses, the failure to make progress as planned on the separation transactions and continued progress in decreasing GE’s
leverage, reduced diversification of GE’s businesses following the separation transactions, or changes in rating application or methodology. Future
downgrades could further adversely affect our ability to execute the planned spin-off of GE Vernova, as well as our cost of funds and related margins,
liquidity, competitive position and access to capital markets, and a significant downgrade could have an adverse commercial impact on our businesses.
In addition, swap, forward and option contracts are executed under standard master agreements that typically contain mutual downgrade provisions
that provide the ability of the counterparty to require termination if the credit ratings of the applicable GE entity were to fall below specified ratings
levels agreed upon with the counterparty. For additional discussion about our current credit ratings and related considerations, refer to the Capital
Resources and Liquidity - Credit Ratings and Conditions section within MD&A.

Financial services operations - We continue to have exposure to insurance, credit, legal and other risks in our financial services operations
and, in the event of future adverse developments, may not be able to meet our business and financial objectives without further actions or
additional capital contributions. To fund the remaining statutory capital contributions that we expect to make to our insurance subsidiaries, as well
as to meet our debt maturities and other obligations, we expect to rely on liquidity from our operations. There is a risk that future adverse
developments could cause funding or liquidity stress. For example, it is possible that future requirements for capital contributions to our insurance
subsidiaries will be greater than currently estimated, or that contemplated contributions could be accelerated by regulators. Our annual testing of
insurance reserves is subject to a variety of assumptions, including assumptions about the discount rate (which is sensitive to changes in market
interest rates), morbidity, mortality and future long-term care premium increases. Any future adverse changes to these assumptions (to the extent not
offset by any favorable changes to these assumptions) could result in an increase to future policy benefit reserves and, potentially, to the amount of
capital we are required to contribute to our insurance subsidiaries (as discussed in the Other Items - Insurance section within MD&A). We also
anticipate that the new insurance accounting standard that became effective on January 1, 2023 (as discussed in the Other Items - New Accounting
Standards section within MD&A) will materially affect our financial statements and require changes to certain of our processes, systems, and controls.
In addition, we continue to evaluate potential strategic options to accelerate the further reduction in the size of our financial services operations. Some
of these options could involve cash payments, financial charges or other adverse effects depending on the timing, negotiated terms and conditions of
any ultimate arrangements. In addition, our financial services operations also have exposure to various industries and counterparties, including
insurance companies, brokers and dealers, and financial institutions, which exposes us to credit and other risks in the event of insolvency or other
default of a counterparty. For example, a portion of our run-off insurance operations’ assets are held in trust accounts associated with reinsurance
contracts. For our UFLIC subsidiary, such trust assets are currently held in trusts for the benefit of insurance company subsidiaries of Genworth, which
stated in 2021 that any proceeds from its contingency plan will be used to repay parent company debt and not to bolster the capital position of its
insurance subsidiaries. Solvency or other concerns about Genworth or its insurance company subsidiaries may cause those subsidiaries or their
regulators to take or attempt to take actions that could adversely affect UFLIC, including control over assets in the relevant trusts. It is also possible
that contingent liabilities and loss estimates from our financial services-related continuing or discontinued operations, such as those related to Bank
BPH (see Note 24), will need to be recognized or increase in the future and will become payable. There can be no assurance that future liabilities,
losses or impairments to the carrying value of assets within our financial services operations would not materially and adversely affect GE’s business,
financial position, cash flows, results of operations or capacity to provide financing to support orders at the businesses.

Postretirement benefit plans - Increases in pension, healthcare and life insurance benefits obligations and costs can adversely affect our
earnings, cash flows and further progress toward our leverage goals. Our results of operations and financial conditions may be positively or
negatively affected by the amount of income or expense we record for our defined benefit pension plans. GAAP requires that we calculate income or
expense for the plans using actuarial valuations, which reflect assumptions about financial markets, interest rates and other economic conditions such
as the discount rate and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. We are also required to make an annual measurement of plan assets
and liabilities, which may result in a significant reduction or increase to equity. The factors that impact our pension calculations are subject to changes
in key economic indicators, and


                                                                                                                                          2022 FORM 10-K 37
future decreases in the discount rate or low returns on plan assets can increase our funding obligations and adversely impact our financial results. In
addition, although GAAP expense and pension funding contributions are not directly related, key economic factors that affect GAAP expense, such as
a prolonged environment of low interest rates or sustained market volatility, would also likely affect the amount of cash we would be required to
contribute to pension plans under ERISA. Such factors could also result in a failure to achieve expected returns on plan assets. In addition, there may
be upward pressure on the cost of providing healthcare benefits to current and future retirees. There can be no assurance that the measures we have
taken to control increases in these costs, or that the assignment of assets and liabilities with respect to certain U.S. and non-U.S. benefit plans in
connection with GE’s ongoing separation into three separate companies, will succeed in limiting cost increases, and continued upward pressure could
reduce our profitability. For a discussion regarding how our financial statements have been and can be affected by our pension and healthcare benefit
obligations, the legal split of certain benefit plans and the transfer of certain postretirement plans to GE HealthCare in connection with the Separation,
see Notes 13 and 28.

LEGAL AND COMPLIANCE RISKS. Legal and compliance risk relates to risks arising from the government and regulatory environment, legal
proceedings and compliance with integrity policies and procedures, including matters relating to financial reporting and the environment, health and
safety. Government and regulatory risk includes the risk that the government or regulatory actions will impose additional cost on us or require us to
make adverse changes to our business models or practices.

Regulatory - We are subject to a wide variety of laws, regulations and government policies that may change in significant ways. Our
businesses are subject to regulation under a wide variety of U.S. federal and state and non-U.S. laws, regulations and policies. There can be no
assurance that laws, regulations and policies will not be changed or interpreted or enforced in ways that will require us to modify our business models
and objectives or affect our returns on investments by restricting existing activities and products, subjecting them to escalating costs or prohibiting
them outright. In particular, recent trends globally toward increased protectionism, import and export controls, required licenses or authorizations to
engage in business dealings with certain countries or entities, the use of tariffs, restrictions on outbound investment and other trade barriers can result
in actions by governments around the world that have been and may continue to be disruptive and costly to our businesses, and can interfere with our
global operating model and weaken our competitive position. In addition, changes in environmental and climate change laws, regulations or policies
(including carbon pricing, emission standards or sustainable finance, among others) affecting the power or aviation sectors could lead to additional
costs or compliance requirements, a need for additional investment in product designs, require carbon offset investments or otherwise negatively
impact our businesses or competitive position. Other legislative and regulatory areas of significance for our businesses that U.S. and non-U.S.
governments have focused and continue to focus on include cybersecurity, data privacy and sovereignty, anti-corruption, competition law, public
procurement law, compliance with complex trade controls and economic sanctions laws, technical regulations or local content requirements that could
result in market access criteria that our products cannot or do not meet, foreign exchange intervention in response to currency volatility and currency
controls that could restrict the movement of liquidity from particular jurisdictions. Potential changes to tax laws, including changes to taxation of global
income, may have an effect on our subsidiaries' structure, operations, sales, liquidity, cash flows, capital requirements, effective tax rate and
performance. For example, legislative or regulatory measures by U.S. federal, states or non-U.S. governments, or rules, interpretations or audits under
new or existing tax laws such as newly adopted global minimum taxes or other changes to the treatment of global income could increase our cash tax
costs and effective tax rate. Regulation or government scrutiny may impact the requirements for marketing our products and slow our ability to
introduce new products, resulting in an adverse impact on our business. Furthermore, we make sales to U.S. and non-U.S. governments and other
public sector customers, and we participate in various governmental financing programs, that require us to comply with strict governmental regulations.
As a U.S. government contractor, we are also subject to risks relating to U.S. government audits and investigations that can lead to fines, damages or
other penalties. Inability to comply with applicable regulations could adversely affect our status with government customers or our ability to participate
in projects, and could have collateral consequences such as suspension or debarment. Suspension or debarment, depending on the entity involved
and length of time, can limit our ability to bid for new U.S. government contracts or business with other government-related customers, or to participate
in projects involving multilateral development banks, and this could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.

Legal proceedings - We are subject to legal proceedings, disputes, investigations and legal compliance risks, including trailing liabilities
from businesses that we dispose of or that are inactive. We are subject to a variety of legal proceedings, commercial disputes, legal compliance
risks and environmental, health and safety compliance risks in virtually every part of the world. We, our representatives, and the industries in which we
operate are subject to continuing scrutiny by regulators, other governmental authorities and private sector entities or individuals in the U.S., the
European Union, China and other jurisdictions, which have led or may, in certain circumstances, lead to enforcement actions, adverse changes to our
business practices, fines and penalties, required remedial actions such as contaminated site clean-up or other environmental claims, or the assertion
of private litigation claims and/or damages that could be material. For example, following our acquisition of Alstom's Thermal, Renewables and Grid
businesses in 2015, we are subject to legacy legal proceedings and legal compliance risks that relate to claimed anti-competitive conduct or corruption
by Alstom in the pre-acquisition period, and payments for settlements, judgments, penalties or other liabilities in connection with those matters have
resulted and will in the future result in cash outflows. In addition, while in December 2020 we entered into a settlement to conclude the previously
disclosed SEC investigation of GE, we remain subject to shareholder lawsuits related to the Company's financial performance, accounting and
disclosure practices and related legacy matters. We have observed that these proceedings related to claims about past financial performance and
reporting pose particular reputational risks for the Company that can cause new allegations about past or current misconduct, even if unfounded, to
have a more significant impact on our reputation and how we are viewed by investors, customers and others than they otherwise would. We have
established reserves for legal matters when and as appropriate; however, the estimation of legal reserves or possible losses involves significant
judgment and may not reflect the full range of uncertainties and unpredictable outcomes inherent in litigation and investigations, and the actual losses
arising from particular matters may exceed our current estimates and adversely affect our results of operations. The risk management and compliance
programs we have adopted and related actions that we take may not fully mitigate legal and compliance risks that we face, particularly



2022 FORM 10-K 38
in light of the global and diverse nature of our operations and the current enforcement environments in many jurisdictions. For example, when we
investigate potential noncompliance under U.S. and non-U.S. law involving GE employees or third parties we work with, in some circumstances we
make self-disclosures about our findings to the relevant authorities who may pursue or decline to pursue enforcement proceedings against us in
connection with those matters. We are also subject to material trailing legal liabilities from businesses that we dispose of or that are inactive. We also
expect that additional legal proceedings and other contingencies will arise from time to time. Moreover, we sell products and services in growth
markets where claims arising from alleged violations of law, product failures or other incidents involving our products and services are adjudicated
within legal systems that are less developed and less reliable than those of the U.S. or other more developed markets, and this can create additional
uncertainty about the outcome of proceedings before courts or other governmental bodies in those markets. See Note 24 for further information about
legal proceedings and other loss contingencies.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. We are reporting the following environmental matter in compliance with SEC requirements to disclose environmental
proceedings where a governmental authority is a party and that involve potential monetary sanctions of $300,000 or greater. In July 2022, GE
HealthCare received a notice of intention to impose an administrative fine of approximately $0.6 million related to a December 2019 liquid hazardous
waste event at its Rehovot, Israel site. The event involved clean room waste that spilled onto an unsealed floor, leading to an escape of a small
amount of liquid to a third-party facility on a lower floor. The Israeli Ministry of Environmental Protection (MEP) concluded that the incident breached
the site’s toxins permit. In accordance with local law, GE HealthCare responded to MEP’s notice of fine challenging both the basis for, and level of, the
fine. A decision from MEP is pending. With our spin-off of GE HealthCare in January 2023, GE will no longer report on this matter. Refer to Legal
Matters and Environmental, Health and Safety Matters in Note 24 to the consolidated financial statements for further information relating to our legal
matters.


MANAGEMENT AND AUDITOR’S REPORTS
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION OF FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY. Management is responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial
statements and related information that are presented in this report. The consolidated financial statements, which include amounts based on
management’s estimates and judgments, have been prepared in conformity with U.S generally accepted accounting principles.

The Company designs and maintains accounting and internal control systems to provide reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded against
loss from unauthorized use or disposition, and that the financial records are reliable for preparing consolidated financial statements and maintaining
accountability for assets. These systems are enhanced by policies and procedures, an organizational structure providing division of responsibilities,
careful selection and training of qualified personnel, and a program of internal audits.

The Company engaged Deloitte and Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, to audit and render an opinion on the consolidated
financial statements and internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(PCAOB).

The Board of Directors, through its Audit Committee, which consists entirely of independent directors, meets periodically with management, internal
auditors, and our independent registered public accounting firm to ensure that each is meeting its responsibilities and to discuss matters concerning

To the shareholders and the Board of Directors of General Electric Company

Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of financial position of General Electric Company and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of
December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of earnings (loss), comprehensive income (loss), changes in shareholders’ equity,
and cash flows for the years ended 2022 and 2021, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the
financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of
its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 10, 2023, expressed an unqualified
opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.

Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's
financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect
to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange
Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audit included
performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing
procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or
required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2)
involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our
opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions
on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.

Sales of services - Revenue recognition on certain long-term service agreements - Refer to Notes 1 and 8 to the financial statements

Critical Audit Matter Description
The Company enters into long-term service agreements with certain customers, predominately within the Aerospace and Power segments. These
agreements require the Company to provide maintenance services for customer assets over the contract term, which generally range from 5 to 25
years. Revenue for these agreements is recognized using the percentage of completion method, based on costs incurred relative to total estimated
costs over the contract term. As part of the revenue recognition process, the Company estimates both customer payments that are expected to be
received and costs to perform maintenance services over the contract term. Key estimates that require significant judgment from management include:
(a) how the customer will utilize the assets covered over the contract term; (b) the expected timing and extent of future maintenance and overhaul
services; (c) the future cost of materials, labor, and other resources; and (d) forward looking information concerning market conditions.

Given the complexity involved with evaluating the key estimates, which includes significant judgment necessary to estimate customer payments and
future costs, auditing these assumptions required a high degree of auditor judgment and extensive audit effort, including the involvement of
professionals with specialized skills and industry knowledge.

How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit
Our auditing procedures over the key estimates described above related to the amount and timing of revenue recognition of the long-term service
agreements, predominately within the Aerospace and Power segments, included the following, among others:

    •    We tested the effectiveness of controls over the revenue recognition process for the long-term service agreements, including controls over
         management’s key estimates.
    •    We evaluated management’s risk assessment process through observation of key meetings and processes, including inspection of
         documentation, addressing contract status and current market conditions including the timely incorporation of changes that affect total
         estimated costs to complete the contract and future billings.
    •    We evaluated the appropriateness and consistency of management’s methods and key assumptions applied in recognizing revenue and
         developing cost estimates.



2022 FORM 10-K 40
    •    We tested management’s utilization assumptions for the assets covered over the contract term, which impact the estimated timing and extent
         of future maintenance and overhaul services by comparing current estimates to historical information and projected market conditions.
    •    We tested management’s process for estimating the timing and amount of costs associated with maintenance, overhaul, and other major
         events throughout the contract term, including comparing estimates to historical cost experience, performing a retrospective review,
         performing analytical procedures, and utilizing specialists to evaluate engineering studies and statistical models used by the Company to
         estimate the useful life of certain components of the installed equipment.

Premium deficiency testing - future policy benefits – refer to Notes 1 and 12 to the financial statements

Critical Audit Matter Description
The Company performs premium deficiency testing to assess the adequacy of future policy benefit reserves on an annual basis or whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that a premium deficiency event may have occurred. Significant uncertainties exist in testing cash flow projections
in the premium deficiency test for these insurance contracts, including consideration of a wide range of possible outcomes of future events over the life
of the insurance contracts that can extend for long periods of time.

Given the significant judgments made by management in estimating the cash flow projections used in the premium deficiency test, including the
determination of certain key assumptions, auditing the premium deficiency test required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of
effort, including the involvement of our actuarial specialists. Key assumptions impacting the cash flow projections that are sensitive and are more
subjective requiring significant judgment by management are discount rate, rate of changes in morbidity, and future long-term care premium rate
increases.

How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit
Our audit procedures, which included the involvement of our actuarial specialists, related to the premium deficiency analysis included the following,
among others:

    •    We tested the effectiveness of controls related to the premium deficiency test process, including controls over the development of key
         assumptions and management’s judgments related to the development of the cash flow projections.
    •    We tested the underlying data for completeness and accuracy, including historical cash flows that served as the basis for the actuarial
         estimates.
    •    We evaluated the key assumptions by considering historical actual experience, sensitivity analyses, relevant industry data when available,
         and management’s basis for changes or lack of change in key assumptions.
    •    We performed recalculations to assess key assumptions were appropriately applied in the cash flow projections.
    •    We evaluated management’s conclusion for the premium deficiency test and verified the results appropriately reflected key assumptions.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the shareholders and the Board of Directors of General Electric Company

Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of General Electric Company and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2022,
based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as
of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the
consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022, of the Company and our report dated February 10, 2023,
expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.

Basis for Opinion
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial
Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public
accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal
securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included
obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the
design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary
in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have
a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation
of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

NOTE 1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
FINANCIAL STATEMENT PRESENTATION. Our financial statements are prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles
(GAAP), which requires us to make estimates based on assumptions about current, and for some estimates, future, economic and market conditions
which affect reported amounts and related disclosures in our financial statements. Although our current estimates contemplate current and expected
future conditions, as applicable, it is reasonably possible that actual conditions could differ from our expectations, which could materially affect our
results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Such changes could result in future impairments of goodwill, intangibles, long-lived assets and
investment securities, revisions to estimated profitability on long-term product service agreements, incremental credit losses on receivables and debt
securities, a change in the carrying amount of our tax assets and liabilities, or a change in our insurance liabilities and pension obligations as of the
time of a relevant measurement event.

In preparing our Statement of Cash Flows, we make certain adjustments to reflect cash flows that cannot otherwise be calculated by changes in our
Statement of Financial Position. These adjustments may include, but are not limited to, the effects of currency exchange, acquisitions and dispositions
of businesses, businesses classified as held for sale, the timing of settlements to suppliers for property, plant and equipment, non-cash gains/losses
and other balance sheet reclassifications.

We have reclassified certain prior-year amounts to conform to the current-year’s presentation, including retrospective adjustments made in 2021 to
present: the remainder of our former Capital segment within Corporate, sales of spare parts within Sales of services and the related costs as Costs of
services sold, and earnings per share to reflect the reverse stock split. Unless otherwise noted, tables are presented in U.S. dollars in millions. Certain
columns and rows may not add due to the use of rounded numbers. Percentages presented are calculated from the underlying numbers in millions.
Earnings per share amounts are computed independently for earnings from continuing operations, earnings from discontinued operations and net
earnings. As a result, the sum of per-share amounts may not equal the total. Unless otherwise indicated, information in these notes to consolidated
financial statements relates to continuing operations. Certain of our operations have been presented as discontinued. We present businesses whose
disposal represents a strategic shift that has, or will have, a major effect on our operations and financial results as discontinued operations when the
components meet the criteria for held for sale, are sold, or spun-off. See Note 2 for further information.

On January 3, 2023, General Electric Company (the Company or GE) completed the previously announced separation (the Separation) of its
HealthCare business, into a separate, independent publicly traded company. See Note 28 for further information.

CONSOLIDATION. Our financial statements consolidate all of our affiliates, entities where we have a controlling financial interest, most often because
we hold a majority voting interest, or where we are required to apply the variable interest entity (VIE) model because we have the power to direct the
most economically significant activities of entities. We reevaluate whether we have a controlling financial interest in all entities when our rights and
interests change.

REVENUES FROM THE SALE OF EQUIPMENT. Performance Obligations Satisfied Over Time. We recognize revenue on agreements for the sale
of customized goods including power generation equipment, long-term construction projects and military development contracts on an over-time basis
as we customize the customer's equipment during the manufacturing or integration process and obtain right to payment for work performed.

We recognize revenue as we perform under the arrangements using the percentage of completion method, which is based on our costs incurred to
date relative to our estimate of total expected costs. Our estimate of costs to be incurred to fulfill our promise to a customer is based on our history of
manufacturing or constructing similar assets for customers and is updated routinely to reflect changes in quantity or pricing of the inputs. We provide
for potential losses on these agreements when it is probable that we will incur the loss.

Our billing terms for these over-time contracts are generally based on achieving specified milestones. The differences between the timing of our
revenue recognized (based on costs incurred) and customer billings (based on contractual terms) results in changes to our contract asset or contract
liability positions. See Note 8 for further information.

Performance Obligations Satisfied at a Point in Time. We recognize revenue on agreements for non-customized equipment including commercial
aircraft engines, healthcare equipment and other goods we manufacture on a standardized basis for sale to the market at the point in time that the
customer obtains control of the product, which is generally no earlier than when the customer has physical possession. We use proof of delivery for
certain large equipment with more complex logistics, whereas the delivery of other equipment is estimated based on historical averages of in-transit
periods (i.e., time between shipment and delivery).

Where arrangements include customer acceptance provisions based on seller or customer-specified objective criteria, we recognize revenue when
we have concluded that the customer has control of the equipment and that acceptance is likely to occur. We do not provide for anticipated losses
on point-in-time transactions prior to transferring control of the equipment to the customer.

Our billing terms for these point-in-time equipment contracts generally coincide with delivery to the customer; however, within certain businesses, we
receive progress collections from customers for large equipment purchases, to generally reserve production slots.




2022 FORM 10-K 48
REVENUES FROM THE SALE OF SERVICES. Consistent with our Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations (MD&A) discussion and the way we manage our businesses, we refer to sales under service agreements, which includes both goods (such
as spare parts and equipment upgrades) and related services (such as monitoring, maintenance and repairs) as sales of “services,” which is an
important part of our operations. We sometimes offer our customers financing discounts for the purchase of certain equipment when sold in
contemplation of long-term service agreements. These sales are accounted for as financing arrangements when payments for the equipment are
collected through higher usage-based fees from servicing the equipment. See Note 8 for further information.

Performance Obligations Satisfied Over Time. We enter into long-term service agreements with our customers primarily within our Aerospace and
Power segments. These agreements require us to provide preventative maintenance, overhauls, and standby "warranty-type" services that include
certain levels of assurance regarding asset performance and uptime throughout the contract periods, which generally range from 5 to 25 years. We
account for items that are integral to the maintenance of the equipment as part of our performance obligation, unless the customer has a substantive
right to make a separate purchasing decision (e.g., equipment upgrade).

We recognize revenue as we perform under the arrangements using the percentage of completion method which is based on our costs incurred to
date relative to our estimate of total expected costs. Throughout the life of a contract, this measure of progress captures the nature, timing and extent
of our underlying performance activities as our stand-ready services often fluctuate between routine inspections and maintenance, unscheduled
service events and major overhauls at predetermined usage intervals. We provide for potential losses on these agreements when it is probable that we
will incur the loss.

Our billing terms for these arrangements are generally based on the utilization of the asset (e.g., per hour of usage) or upon the occurrence of a major
maintenance event within the contract, such as an overhaul. The differences between the timing of our revenue recognized (based on costs incurred)
and customer billings (based on contractual terms) results in changes to our contract asset or contract liability positions. See Note 8 for further
information.

We also enter into long-term services agreements in our HealthCare and Renewable Energy segments. Revenues are recognized for these
arrangements on a straight-line basis consistent with the nature, timing and extent of our services, which primarily relate to routine maintenance and as
needed equipment repairs. We generally invoice periodically as services are provided.

Performance Obligations Satisfied at a Point in Time. We sell certain tangible products, largely spare parts, through our services businesses. We
recognize revenues and bill our customers at the point in time that the customer obtains control of the good, which is at the point in time we deliver the
spare part to the customer.

COLLABORATIVE ARRANGEMENTS. Our Aerospace business enters into collaborative arrangements and joint ventures with manufacturers and
suppliers of components used to build and maintain certain engines. Under these arrangements, GE and its collaborative partners share in the risks
and rewards of these programs through various revenue, cost and profit sharing payment structures. GE recognizes revenue and costs for these
arrangements based on the scope of work GE is responsible for transferring to its customers. GE’s payments to participants are primarily recorded as
either cost of services sold ($2,898 million, $2,125 million and $2,407 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively) or
as cost of equipment sold ($658 million, $751 million and $1,093 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively). Our
most significant collaborative arrangement is with Safran Aircraft Engines, a subsidiary of Safran Group of France, which sells LEAP and CFM56
engines through CFM International, a jointly owned non-consolidated company. GE makes substantial sales of parts and services to CFM International
based on arms-length terms.

INSURANCE REVENUES. Insurance revenues are comprised primarily of premiums and investment income related to our run-off Insurance business.
For traditional long-duration insurance contracts, we report premiums as revenue when due. Premiums received on non-traditional long-duration
insurance contracts and investment contracts, including annuities without significant mortality risk, are not reported as revenues but rather as deposit
liabilities. We recognize revenues for charges and assessments on these contracts, mostly for mortality, contract initiation, administration and
surrender. Amounts credited to policyholder accounts are charged to expense.

CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND RESTRICTED CASH. Debt securities and money market instruments with original maturities of three months or
less are included in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash unless classified as available-for-sale investment securities. Restricted cash primarily
comprised funds restricted in connection with certain ongoing litigation matters and amounted to $745 million and $317 million at December 31, 2022
and 2021, respectively.

INVESTMENT SECURITIES. We report investments in available-for-sale debt securities and certain equity securities at fair value. Unrealized gains
and losses on available-for-sale debt securities are recorded to other comprehensive income, net of applicable taxes and adjustments related to our
insurance liabilities. Unrealized gains and losses on equity securities with readily determinable fair values are recorded to earnings.

Although we generally do not have the intent to sell any specific debt securities in the ordinary course of managing our portfolio, we may sell debt
securities prior to their maturities for a variety of reasons, including diversification, credit quality, yield and liquidity requirements and the funding of
claims and obligations to policyholders.




                                                                                                                                              2022 FORM 10-K 49
We regularly review investment securities for impairment. For debt securities, if we do not intend to sell the security or it is not more likely than not that
we will be required to sell the security before recovery of our amortized cost, we evaluate qualitative criteria, such as the financial health of and specific
prospects for the issuer, to determine whether we do not expect to recover the amortized cost basis of the security. We also evaluate quantitative
criteria including determining whether there has been an adverse change in expected future cash flows. If we do not expect to recover the entire
amortized cost basis of the security, we consider the security to contain an expected credit loss, and we record the difference between the security’s
amortized cost basis and its recoverable amount in earnings as an allowance for credit loss and the difference between the security’s recoverable
amount and fair value in other comprehensive income. If we intend to sell the security or it is more likely than not we will be required to sell the security
before recovery of its amortized cost basis, the security is considered impaired, and we recognize the entire difference between the security’s
amortized cost basis and its fair value in earnings. See Note 3 for further information.

CURRENT RECEIVABLES. Amounts due from customers arising from the sales of equipment and services are recorded at the outstanding amount,
less allowance for losses. We regularly monitor the recoverability of our receivables. See Note 4 for further information.

ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES. When we record customer receivables, contract assets and financing receivables arising from revenue
transactions, as well as commercial mortgage loans and reinsurance recoverables in our run-off insurance operations, financial guarantees and certain
commitments, we record an allowance for credit losses for the current expected credit losses (CECL) inherent in the asset over its expected life. The
allowance for credit losses is a valuation account deducted from the amortized cost basis of the assets to present their net carrying value at the
amount expected to be collected. Each period, the allowance for credit losses is adjusted through earnings to reflect expected credit losses over the
remaining lives of the assets. We evaluate debt securities with unrealized losses to determine whether any of the losses arise from concerns about the
issuer’s credit or the underlying collateral and record an allowance for credit losses, if required.

We estimate expected credit losses based on relevant information about past events, including historical experience, current conditions, and
reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount. When measuring expected credit losses, we pool assets with
similar country risk and credit risk characteristics. Changes in the relevant information may significantly affect the estimates of expected credit losses.

INVENTORIES. All inventories are stated at lower of cost or realizable values. Cost of inventories is primarily determined on a first-in, first-out (FIFO)
basis. See Note 5 for further information.

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT. The cost of property, plant and equipment is generally depreciated on a straight-line basis over its estimated
economic life. See Note 6 for further information.

LEASE ACCOUNTING FOR LESSEE ARRANGEMENTS. At lease commencement, we record a lease liability and corresponding right-of-use (ROU)
asset. Options to extend the lease are included as part of the ROU lease asset and liability when it is reasonably certain the Company will exercise the
option. We have elected to include lease and non-lease components in determining our lease liability for all leased assets except our vehicle leases.
Non-lease components are generally services that the lessor performs for the Company associated with the leased asset. The present value of our
lease liability is determined using our incremental collateralized borrowing rate at lease inception. For leases with an initial term of 12 months or less,
an ROU asset and lease liability is not recognized and lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. We test ROU assets
whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that the asset may be impaired.

GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS. We test goodwill at least annually for impairment at the reporting unit level. We recognize an
impairment charge if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value. When a portion of a reporting unit is disposed, goodwill is allocated
to the gain or loss on disposition based on the relative fair values of the business or businesses disposed and the portion of the reporting unit that will
be retained.

For other intangible assets that are not deemed indefinite-lived, cost is generally amortized on a straight-line basis over the asset’s estimated
economic life, except for individually significant customer-related intangible assets that are amortized in relation to total related sales. Amortizable
intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be
recoverable. In these circumstances, they are tested for impairment based on undiscounted cash flows and, if impaired, written down to estimated fair
value based on either discounted cash flows or appraised values. See Note 7 for further information.

DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING. We use derivatives to manage a variety of risks, including risks related to interest rates, foreign exchange, certain
equity investments and commodity prices. Accounting for derivatives as hedges requires that, at inception and over the term of the arrangement, the
hedged item and related derivative meet the requirements for hedge accounting. In evaluating whether a particular relationship qualifies for hedge
accounting, we test effectiveness at inception and each reporting period thereafter by determining whether changes in the fair value of the derivative
offset, within a specified range, changes in the fair value of the hedged item. If fair value changes fail this test, we discontinue applying hedge
accounting to that relationship prospectively. Fair values of both the derivative instrument and the hedged item are calculated using internal valuation
models incorporating market-based assumptions, subject to third-party confirmation, as applicable. See Note 22 for further information.

DEFERRED INCOME TAXES. Deferred income tax balances reflect the effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and
liabilities and their tax bases, as well as from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, and are stated at enacted tax rates expected to be in
effect when those taxes are paid or recovered. Deferred income tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable
income in future years. We evaluate the recoverability of these future tax deductions and credits by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable
income from all sources, including reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies. To
the extent we consider it more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be recovered, a valuation allowance is established. Deferred taxes, as
needed, are provided for our investment in affiliates and associated companies when we plan to remit those earnings. See Note 15 for further
information.

INSURANCE LIABILITIES AND ANNUITY BENEFITS. Our run-off insurance operations include providing insurance and reinsurance for life and
health risks and providing certain annuity products. Primary product types include long-term care, structured settlement annuities, life and disability
insurance contracts and investment contracts. Insurance contracts are contracts with significant mortality and/or morbidity risks, while investment
contracts are contracts without such risks.

Liabilities for traditional long-duration insurance contracts include both future policy benefit reserves and claims reserves. Future policy benefit
reserves represent the present value of future policy benefits less the present value of future gross premiums based on actuarial assumptions.
Liabilities for investment contracts equal the account value, that is, the amount that accrues to the benefit of the contract or policyholder including
credited interest and assessments through the financial statement date.

Claim reserves are established when a claim is incurred or is estimated to have been incurred and represent our best estimate of the present value of
the ultimate obligations for future claim payments and claim adjustments expenses.

To the extent that unrealized gains on specific investment securities supporting our insurance contracts would result in a premium deficiency, should
those gains be realized, an increase in future policy benefit reserves is recorded, with an offsetting after-tax reduction to net unrealized gains recorded
in other comprehensive income.

Reinsurance recoverables are recorded when we cede insurance risk to third parties but are not relieved from our primary obligation to policyholders
and cedents. When losses on ceded risks give rise to claims for recovery, we establish allowances for probable losses on such receivables from
reinsurers as required. See Note 12 for further information.

POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS. We sponsor a number of pension and retiree health and life insurance benefit plans that we present in three
categories, principal pension plans, other pension plans and principal retiree benefit plans. We use a December 31 measurement date for these plans.
On our Statement of Financial Position, we measure our plan assets at fair value and the obligations at the present value of the estimated payments to
plan participants. Participants earn benefits based on their service and pay. Those estimated future payment amounts are determined based on
assumptions. Differences between our actual results and what we assumed are recorded in a separate component of equity each period. These
differences are amortized into earnings over the remaining average future service of active employees or the expected life of inactive participants, as
applicable, who participate in the plan. See Note 13 for further information.

LOSS CONTINGENCIES. Loss contingencies are existing conditions, situations or circumstances involving uncertainty as to possible loss that will
ultimately be resolved when future events occur or fail to occur. Such contingencies include, but are not limited to environmental obligations, litigation,
regulatory investigations and proceedings, product quality and losses resulting from other events and developments. When a loss is considered
probable and reasonably estimable, we record a liability in the amount of our best estimate for the ultimate loss. When there appears to be a range of
possible costs with equal likelihood, liabilities are based on the low-end of such range. Disclosure is provided for material loss contingencies when a
loss is probable but a reasonable estimate cannot be made, and when it is reasonably possible that a loss will be incurred or the amount of a loss will
exceed the recorded provision. We regularly review contingencies to determine whether the likelihood of loss has changed and to assess whether a
reasonable estimate of the loss or range of loss can be made. See Note 24 for further information.

SUPPLY CHAIN FINANCE PROGRAMS. We evaluate supply chain finance programs to ensure where we use a third-party intermediary to settle our
trade payables, their involvement does not change the nature, existence, amount, or timing of our trade payables and does not provide the Company
with any direct economic benefit. If any characteristics of the trade payables change or we receive a direct economic benefit, we reclassify the trade
payables as borrowings.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS. The following sections describe the valuation methodologies we use to measure financial and non-financial
instruments accounted for at fair value including certain assets within our pension plans and retiree benefit plans. Observable inputs reflect market
data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect our market assumptions. These inputs establish a fair value hierarchy:
Level 1 – Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets; Level 2 – Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for
identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations whose inputs are observable or whose significant value
drivers are observable; and Level 3 – Significant inputs to the valuation model are unobservable.

RECURRING FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS. For financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis, primarily investment
securities and derivatives, fair value is the price we would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction with a market
participant at the measurement date. In the absence of active markets for the identical assets or liabilities, such measurements involve developing
assumptions based on market observable data and, in the absence of such data, internal information that is consistent with what market participants
would use in a hypothetical transaction that occurs at the measurement date. See Note 21 for further information.


                                                                                                                                           2022 FORM 10-K 51
Debt Securities. When available, we use quoted market prices to determine the fair value of debt securities which are included in Level 1. For our
remaining debt securities, we obtain pricing information from an independent pricing vendor. The inputs and assumptions to the pricing vendor’s
models are derived from market observable sources including benchmark yields, reported trades, broker/dealer quotes, issuer spreads, benchmark
securities, bids, offers and other market-related data. These investments are included in Level 2. Our pricing vendors may also provide us with
valuations that are based on significant unobservable inputs, and in those circumstances, we classify the investment securities in Level 3.

Annually, we conduct reviews of our primary pricing vendor to validate that the inputs used in that vendor’s pricing process are deemed to be market
observable as defined in the standard. We believe that the prices received from our pricing vendor are representative of prices that would be received
to sell the assets at the measurement date (exit prices) and are classified appropriately in the hierarchy. We use non-binding broker quotes and other
third-party pricing services as our primary basis for valuation when there is limited, or no, relevant market activity for a specific instrument or for other
instruments that share similar characteristics. Debt securities priced in this manner are included in Level 3.

Equity securities with readily determinable fair values. These publicly traded equity securities are valued using quoted prices and are included in
Level 1.

Derivatives. The majority of our derivatives are valued using internal models. The models maximize the use of market observable inputs including
interest rate curves and both forward and spot prices for currencies and commodities. Derivative assets and liabilities included in Level 2 primarily
represent interest rate swaps, cross-currency swaps and foreign currency and commodity forward and option contracts.

Investments in private equity, real estate and collective funds held within our pension plans. Most investments are generally valued using the
net asset value (NAV) per share as a practical expedient for fair value provided certain criteria are met. The NAVs are determined based on the fair
values of the underlying investments in the funds. Investments that are measured at fair value using the NAV practical expedient are not required to be
classified in the fair value hierarchy. Investments classified within Level 3 primarily relate to real estate and private equities which are valued using
unobservable inputs, primarily by discounting expected future cash flows, using comparative market multiples, third-party pricing sources, or a
combination of these approaches as appropriate. See Note 13 for further information.

NONRECURRING FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS. Certain assets are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. These assets may include
loans and long-lived assets reduced to fair value upon classification as held for sale, impaired loans based on the fair value of the underlying collateral,
impaired equity securities without readily determinable fair value, equity method investments and long-lived assets, and remeasured retained
investments in formerly consolidated subsidiaries upon a change in control that results in the deconsolidation of that subsidiary and retention of a
noncontrolling stake in the entity. Assets written down to fair value when impaired and retained investments are not subsequently adjusted to fair value
unless further impairment occurs.

Equity investments without readily determinable fair value and Associated companies. Equity investments without readily determinable fair
value and associated companies are valued using market observable data such as transaction prices when available. When market observable data is
unavailable, investments are valued using either a discounted cash flow model, comparative market multiples, third-party pricing sources or a
combination of these approaches as appropriate. These investments are generally included in Level 3.

Long-lived Assets. Fair values of long-lived assets are primarily derived internally and are based on observed sales transactions for similar assets. In
other instances for which we do not have comparable observed sales transaction data, collateral values are developed internally and corroborated by
external appraisal information. Adjustments to third-party valuations may be performed in circumstances where market comparables are not specific to
the attributes of the specific collateral or appraisal information may not be reflective of current market conditions due to the passage of time and the
occurrence of market events since receipt of the information.

ACCOUNTING CHANGES. The adoption of the new guidance on accounting for long duration insurance contracts on January 1, 2023 will
significantly change the accounting for measurements of our long-duration insurance liabilities and reinsurance recoverables and materially affect our
consolidated financial statements. We currently estimate a decrease in Shareholders’ equity at the transition date of January 1, 2021 from adoption of
the new guidance to be in an after-tax range of $7 billion to $8 billion, including approximately $5.5 billion to $6 billion in Accumulated other
comprehensive income (AOCI) and $1.5 billion to $2 billion in Retained earnings. As of December 31, 2022, we estimate the after-tax decrease in
Shareholders' equity to be reduced to approximately $3 billion to $4 billion, primarily due to changes in the market interest rate environment
subsequent to the transition date.

NOTE 2. BUSINESSES HELD FOR SALE AND DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS. In the first quarter of 2022, we signed a non-binding
memorandum of understanding to sell a portion of our Steam business within our Power segment to Électricité de France S.A. (EDF). In the fourth
quarter of 2022, we signed a binding agreement for this transaction, and we expect to complete the sale, subject to regulatory approval, in the second
half of 2023. Closing the transaction is expected to result in a significant gain.

In the fourth quarter of 2022, we classified our captive industrial insurance subsidiary, with assets of $638 million and liabilities of $372 million, into held
for sale and recorded a loss of $17 million in Other income (loss) in our Statement of Earnings (Loss). We expect to complete the sale of this business,
subject to regulatory approval, by the first half of 2024.

In the fourth quarter of 2021, we completed the sale of GE's share of our boiler manufacturing business in China in our Power segment. In connection
with the transaction, we recorded a loss on the disposal of this business of $170 million in Other income (loss) in our consolidated Statement of
Earnings (Loss). See Note 19 for further information.

On March 31, 2020, we completed the sale of our BioPharma business within our HealthCare segment for total consideration of $21,112 million (after
certain working capital adjustments) and incurred $185 million of cash payments directly associated with the transaction. As a result, in 2020, we
recognized a pre-tax gain of $12,362 million ($11,213 million after-tax) in our Statement of Earnings (Loss).

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS primarily comprise our GE Capital Aviation Services (GECAS) business, discontinued in 2021, our mortgage portfolio
in Poland, and other trailing assets and liabilities associated with prior dispositions. Results of operations, financial position and cash flows for these
businesses are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented and the notes to the financial statements have been adjusted on a
retrospective basis.

GECAS/AerCap. On November 1, 2021, we completed the combination of our GECAS business with AerCap Holdings N.V. (AerCap). We
deconsolidated this business, reclassified its results to discontinued operations for all periods presented and recognized a non-cash after-tax loss of
$3,882 million in discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2021.

We have continuing involvement with AerCap, primarily through our ownership interest, ongoing sales or leases of products and services, and
transition services that we provide to AerCap. For the year ended December 31, 2022, we had direct and indirect sales of $162 million to AerCap,
primarily related to engine services and sales, and purchases of $174 million from AerCap, primarily related to engine leases. We paid net cash of
$48 million to AerCap related to this activity.

Bank BPH. The mortgage portfolio in Poland (Bank BPH) comprises floating rate residential mortgages, 85% of which are indexed to or denominated
in foreign currencies (primarily Swiss francs). At December 31, 2022, the total portfolio had a carrying value, net of reserves, of $1,199 million. The
portfolio is recorded at the lower of cost or fair value, less cost to sell, which reflects market yields as well as estimates with respect to ongoing
litigation in Poland related to foreign currency-denominated mortgages and other factors. Loss from discontinued operations included $720 million,
$509 million and $121 million non-cash pre-tax charges for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, reflecting estimates with
respect to ongoing litigation as well as market yields. To ensure appropriate capital levels, we made capital contributions in cash of $530 million and
$360 million into Bank BPH during the second quarter of 2022 and fourth quarter of 2021, respectively. Future changes in the estimated legal liabilities
or market yields could result in further losses and capital contributions related to these loans in future reporting periods beyond the amounts that we
currently estimate. See Note 24 for further information.

NOTE 3. INVESTMENT SECURITIES. All of our debt securities are classified as available-for-sale and substantially all are investment-grade
supporting obligations to annuitants and policyholders in our run-off insurance operations. We manage the investments in our run-off insurance
operations under strict investment guidelines, including limitations on asset class concentration, single issuer exposures, asset-liability duration
variances, and other factors to meet credit quality, yield, liquidity and diversification requirements associated with servicing our insurance liabilities
under reasonable circumstances. This process includes consideration of various asset allocation strategies and incorporates information from several
external investment advisors to improve our investment yield subject to maintaining our ability to satisfy insurance liabilities when due, as well as
considering our risk-based capital requirements, regulatory constraints, and tolerance for surplus volatility. Asset allocation planning is a dynamic
process that considers changes in market conditions, risk appetite, liquidity needs and other factors, which are reviewed on a periodic basis by our
investment team. On November 1, 2021, we received 111.5 million ordinary shares of AerCap (approximately 46% ownership interest) and an AerCap
senior note as partial consideration in conjunction with the GECAS transaction, for which we have adopted the fair value option. Our investment in
Baker Hughes (BKR) comprises 7.0 million shares (approximately 1% ownership interest) at December 31, 2022. Both our AerCap and BKR
investments are recorded as Equity securities with readily determinable fair values. Investment securities held within insurance entities are classified
as non-current as they support the long-duration insurance liabilities.

The amortized cost of debt securities excludes accrued interest of $457 million and $415 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, which
is reported in All other current assets.

The estimated fair value of investment securities at December 31, 2022 decreased since December 31, 2021, primarily due to higher market yields
and widening credit spreads, BKR share sales, and the mark-to-market effect on our equity interest in AerCap, partially offset by new insurance
investments, including related to the recapture transaction, and the mark-to-market effect on our remaining equity interest in BKR. See Note 12 for
further information about the recapture transaction.

Total estimated fair value of debt securities in an unrealized loss position were $21,482 million and $3,446 million, of which $3,275 million and $644
million had gross unrealized losses of $(835) million and $(42) million and had been in a loss position for 12 months or more at December 31, 2022
and 2021, respectively. Gross unrealized losses of $(3,143) million at December 31, 2022 included $(2,164) million related to U.S. corporate securities,
$(182) million related to commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) collateralized by pools of commercial mortgage loans on real estate, and
$(106) million related to Asset-backed securities. The majority of our U.S. corporate securities' gross unrealized losses were in the consumer, electric,
technology, insurance and energy industries. The majority of our CMBS and Asset-backed securities in an unrealized loss position have received
investment-grade credit ratings from the major rating agencies. For our securities in an unrealized loss position, the losses are not indicative of credit
losses, we currently do not intend to sell the investments, and it is not likely that we will be required to sell the investments before recovery of their
amortized cost basis.

Net unrealized gains (losses) for equity securities with readily determinable fair values, which are recorded in Other income (loss) within continuing
operations, were $(65) million, $1,656 million and $(1,670) million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

Proceeds from debt and equity securities sales, early redemptions by issuers and principal payments on the BKR promissory note totaled $7,268
million, $6,666 million and $5,060 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Gross realized gains on debt securities
were $34 million, $69 million and $173 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Gross realized losses and
impairments on debt securities were $(42) million, $(11) million and $(68) million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

We expect actual maturities to differ from contractual maturities because borrowers have the right to call or prepay certain obligations.

In addition to the equity securities described above, we hold $731 million and $441 million of equity securities without readily determinable fair values
at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, that are classified within non-current All other assets in our Statement of Financial Position. Fair value
adjustments, including impairments, recorded in earnings were $(11) million, $46 million and $(141) million for the years ended December 31, 2022,
2021 and 2020, respectively.

Our run-off insurance operations have approximately $800 million of assets held by states or other regulatory bodies in statutorily required deposit
accounts, and approximately $29,700 million of assets held in trust accounts, including $2,300 million to be added in the first quarter of 2023,
associated with reinsurance contracts and reinsurance security trust agreements in place between either Employers Reassurance Corporation (ERAC)
or Union Fidelity Life Insurance Company (UFLIC) as the reinsuring entity and a number of ceding insurers. Assets in these trusts are held by an
independent trustee for the benefit of the ceding insurer, and are subject to various investment guidelines as set forth in the respective reinsurance
contracts and trust agreements. Some of these trust agreements may allow a ceding company to withdraw trust assets from the trust and hold these
assets on its balance sheet, in an account under its control for the benefit of ERAC or UFLIC which might allow the ceding company to exercise
investment control over such assets.

(a) Corporate balance at December 31, 2022 and 2021 comprises our Digital business.

In the fourth quarter of 2022, we performed our annual impairment test. Based on the results of this test, the fair values of each of our reporting units
exceeded their carrying values, however, we identified two reporting units for which the fair values were not substantially in excess of their carrying
values. The fair values of our Digital reporting unit at Corporate and the Additive reporting unit in our Aerospace segment were in excess of their
carrying values by 16% and 21%, respectively. At December 31, 2022, our Digital and Additive reporting units had goodwill of $818 million and $239
million, respectively.

Determining the fair value of reporting units requires the use of estimates and significant judgments that are based on a number of factors including
actual operating results. It is reasonably possible that the judgments and estimates described above could change in future periods.

(a) Balances include indefinite-lived intangible assets.

Substantially all other intangible assets are subject to amortization. Intangible assets decreased $1,705 million in 2022, primarily as a result of
amortization partially offset by the acquisition of capitalized software and patents and technology mainly at Aerospace and HealthCare of $209 million.
Consolidated amortization expense was $1,742 million, $1,138 million and $1,336 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020,
respectively.

In the first quarter of 2022, we signed a non-binding memorandum of understanding for GE Steam Power to sell a portion of its business to EDF, which
resulted in a reclassification of that business to held for sale. As a result, we recognized a non-cash pre-tax impairment charge of $765 million related
to intangible assets at our remaining Steam business within our Power segment. We determined the fair value of these intangible assets using an
income approach. This charge was recorded by Corporate in Selling, general, and administrative expenses in our consolidated Statement of Earnings
(Loss).

Estimated consolidated annual pre-tax amortization for intangible assets over the next five calendar years are as follows:

During 2022, we recorded additions to intangible assets subject to amortization of $214 million with a weighted-average amortizable period of 7.1
years, including capitalized software of $172 million, with a weighted-average amortizable period of 5.9 years.

NOTE 8. CONTRACT AND OTHER DEFERRED ASSETS & PROGRESS COLLECTIONS AND DEFERRED INCOME
Contract and other deferred assets decreased $1,907 million in the year ended December 31, 2022 primarily due to decreased long-term service
agreements and the timing of billing milestones ahead of revenue recognition on long-term equipment contracts. Our long-term service agreements
decreased primarily due to billings of $11,665 million, partially offset by revenues recognized of $9,680 million and net favorable changes in estimated
profitability of $85 million at Aerospace and $303 million at Power, primarily attributable to contractual increases in billings, partially offset by cost
inflation.

    upgrades, which we collect through incremental fixed or usage-based fees from servicing the equipment under long-term service agreements.

Progress collections and deferred income increased $763 million primarily due new collections received in excess of revenue recognition at
Aerospace, including increased collections to support higher production, and at Renewable Energy, partially offset by a decrease at Power due to the
reclassification of a portion of our GE Steam Power business to held for sale. Revenues recognized for contracts included in a liability position at the
beginning of the year were $13,863 million and $14,884 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

NOTE 12. INSURANCE LIABILITIES AND ANNUITY BENEFITS. Insurance liabilities and annuity benefits comprise substantially all
obligations to annuitants and insureds in our run-off insurance operations. Our insurance operations (net of eliminations) generated revenues of
$2,954 million, $3,106 million and $2,865 million, profit was $60 million, $566 million and $197 million and net earnings was $44 million, $444 million
and $143 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. These operations were supported by assets of $44,197 million
and $49,894 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. A summary of our insurance contracts is presented below:

(a) The decrease in Other adjustments of $3,394 million is a result of the decline in unrealized gains on investment securities.
(b) Other contracts included claim reserves of $242 million related to short-duration contracts at Electric Insurance Company (EIC), net of eliminations,
    at December 31, 2021. EIC is a property and casualty insurance company primarily providing insurance to GE and its employees.

Claim reserve activity included incurred claims of $1,481 million, $1,699 million and $1,801 million, of which insignificant amounts related to the
recognition of adjustments to prior year claim reserves arising from our periodic reserve evaluation in the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and
2020, respectively. Paid claims were $1,518 million, $1,709 million and $1,728 million in the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020,
respectively.

Reinsurance recoveries are recorded as a reduction of insurance losses and annuity benefits in our Statement of Earnings (Loss) and amounted to
$321 million, $351 million and $350 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
Reinsurance recoverables, net of allowances of an insignificant amount and $1,654 million, are included in non-current All other assets in our
Statement of Financial Position, and amounted to $132 million and $2,651 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

In the third quarter of 2022, we agreed to terminate substantially all long-term care insurance exposures previously ceded to a single reinsurance
company (recapture transaction) and recorded an increase to our allowance for credit losses on such reinsurance recoverables of $415 million (pre-
tax) ($328 million (after-tax)) which is unrelated to changes in claim experience or projections of future policy benefit reserves. Upon closing of the
recapture transaction in the fourth quarter of 2022, we received a net portfolio of investment securities with an estimated fair value of $2,396 million in
complete settlement of reinsurance recoverables previously recognized under retrocession agreements with the reinsurance company, which
represented substantially all of our reinsurance recoverables balance as of September 30, 2022 and recorded an incremental loss of $56 million (pre-
tax) ($44 million (after-tax)).

The recapture transaction reduces both our financial and operational risks by removing the future inherent risk of collectability of reinsurance
recoverables, eliminating retrocession contracts having complex terms and conditions, assuming direct control of the portfolio of investment securities
held in a trust for our benefit and redeploying those assets consistent with our portfolio realignment strategy and establishing administration service
standards intended to enhance claim administration and innovation efforts. The effect of the recapture agreement does not increase our long-term care
insurance liabilities as under the existing retrocession agreements we were not previously relieved of our primary obligation to companies from which
we originally assumed the liabilities. In addition, we do not expect changes to projected statutory funding as a result of the recapture transaction.

Premium Deficiency Testing. We completed our annual premium deficiency testing in the aggregate across our run-off insurance portfolio in the third
quarter of 2022. These procedures included updating certain experience studies since our last test completed in the third quarter of 2021, independent
actuarial analysis (principally on long-term care insurance exposures) and review of industry benchmarks. Using updated assumptions, the 2022
premium deficiency testing results indicated a positive margin of about 10% of the related future policy benefit reserves recorded at September 30,
2022, or approximately equivalent to the 2021 premium deficiency testing results. The premium deficiency testing margin in 2022 was impacted by a
lower discount rate in our ERAC portfolio due to the recapture transaction, as explained above, partially offset by higher prevailing benchmark interest
rates in the U.S. The portfolio of investment securities expected to be received from the recapture transaction were assumed to be invested at yields
below ERAC’s current portfolio yield before ultimately grading to the long-term average investment yield as we reinvest the portfolio over time. This
effect was partially offset by the net impact from assumed moderately higher near-term mortality related to COVID-19 in the aggregate across our run-
off insurance products (i.e., for life insurance products, higher mortality increases the present value of expected future benefit payments, while for
annuity and long-term care insurance contracts, higher mortality decreases the present value of expected future benefit payments). Excluding the net
impact from assumed moderately higher near-term mortality related to COVID-19, we have made no substantial change to our assumptions
concerning morbidity, morbidity improvement, mortality, mortality improvement, terminations, or long-term care insurance premium rate increases in
2022. We regularly monitor emerging experience and industry developments, including these factors, to help us refine all our reserve assumptions,
which may result in future changes to those assumptions.




2022 FORM 10-K 62
Statutory accounting practices, not GAAP, determine the required statutory capital levels of our insurance legal entities. Statutory accounting practices
are set forth by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) as well as state laws, regulation and general administrative rules and
differ in certain respects from GAAP. We annually perform statutory asset adequacy testing and expect our December 31, 2022 testing process to be
completed in the first quarter of 2023, the results of which may affect the amount or timing of capital contributions from GE to the insurance legal
entities.

Following approval of a statutory permitted accounting practice in 2018 by our primary regulator, the Kansas Insurance Department (KID), we provided
a total of $11,400 million of capital contributions to our run-off insurance subsidiaries. We expect to provide further capital contributions of
approximately $3,600 million through 2024 (of which approximately $1,800 million is expected to be contributed in the first quarter of 2023, pending
completion of our December 31, 2022 statutory reporting process, which includes asset adequacy testing), subject to ongoing monitoring by KID. GE is
a party to capital maintenance agreements with its run-off insurance subsidiaries under which GE is required to maintain their statutory capital levels at
300% of their year-end Authorized Control Level risk-based capital requirements as defined from time to time by the NAIC.

NOTE 13. POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS
PENSION BENEFITS AND RETIREE HEALTH AND LIFE BENEFITS. We sponsor a number of pension and retiree health and life insurance benefit
plans that we present in three categories, principal pension plans, other pension plans and principal retiree benefit plans. Smaller pension plans with
pension assets or obligations that have not reached $50 million and other retiree benefit plans are not presented. Information in this Note is as of a
December 31 measurement date for these plans and does not reflect the impact of the GE HealthCare Separation, including the legal split and the
transfer of certain postretirement benefit plans. See Note 28 for information regarding the legal split and the transfer of certain postretirement benefit
plans to GE HealthCare in connection with the Separation.

FUNDING. The Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) determines minimum funding requirements in the U.S. No contributions were
required or made for the GE Pension Plan during 2022 or 2021 and based on our current assumptions, we do not anticipate having to make additional
required contributions to the plan in the near future. On an ERISA basis, our estimate is that the GE Pension Plan was 92.8% and 107.3% funded for
2022 and 2021, respectively. The GAAP funded status is 93.5% and 93.7% for 2022 and 2021, respectively.

As of the measurement date of December 31, we would expect to pay approximately $370 million for benefit payments under our GE Supplementary
Pension Plan and administrative expenses of our principal pension plans and would expect to contribute approximately $170 million to other pension
plans in 2023. We fund retiree health benefits on a pay-as-you-go basis and the retiree life insurance trust at our discretion. As of the measurement
date of December 31, we would expect to contribute approximately $365 million in 2023 to fund such benefits.

ACTIONS. Pension benefits for approximately 2,700 United Kingdom (UK) participants have been frozen effective January 1, 2022. In addition,
pension benefits for approximately 800 Canadian participants will be frozen effective December 31, 2023. These transactions were reflected as a
curtailment loss in 2021 upon announcement.

As of the measurement date of December 31, we would expect 2023 net periodic benefit income for principal pension, other pension and principal
retiree benefit plans to be about $2,010 million, which is an increase of approximately $1,985 million in income from 2022. The increase would
primarily be due to the discount rate. The components of net periodic benefit costs, other than the service cost component, are included in Non-
operating benefit cost (income) in our Statement of Earnings (Loss).

(a) Principally associated with discount rate changes.
(b) The benefit obligation for the GE Supplementary Pension Plan, which is an unfunded plan, was $5,457 million and $7,226 million at December 31,
    2022 and 2021, respectively.
(c) The benefit obligation for retiree health plans was $1,991 million and $2,548 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

ASSUMPTIONS USED IN CALCULATIONS. Our defined benefit pension plans are accounted for on an actuarial basis, which requires the selection
of various assumptions, including a discount rate, a compensation assumption, an expected return on assets, mortality rates of participants and
expectation of mortality improvement.

Projected benefit obligations are measured as the present value of expected benefit payments. We discount those cash payments using a discount
rate. We determine the discount rate using the weighted-average yields on high-quality fixed-income securities with maturities that correspond to the
payment of benefits. Lower discount rates increase present values and generally increase subsequent-year pension expense; higher discount rates
decrease present values and generally reduce subsequent-year pension expense.

The compensation assumption is used to estimate the annual rate at which pay of plan participants will grow. If the rate of growth assumed increases,
the size of the pension obligations will increase, as will the amount recorded in AOCI in our Statement of Financial Position and amortized into
earnings in subsequent periods.

The expected return on plan assets is the estimated long-term rate of return that will be earned on the investments used to fund the benefit obligations.
To determine the expected long-term rate of return on pension plan assets, we consider our asset allocation, as well as historical and expected returns
on various categories of plan assets. In developing future long-term return expectations for our principal benefit plans’ assets, we formulate views on
the future economic environment, both in the U.S. and abroad. We evaluate general market trends and historical relationships among a number of key
variables that impact asset class returns such as expected earnings growth, inflation, valuations, yields and spreads, using both internal and external
sources. We also take into account expected volatility by asset class and diversification across classes to determine expected overall portfolio results
given our asset allocation. Based on our analysis, we have assumed a 6.00% and 6.25% long-term expected return on the GE Pension Plan assets for
cost recognition in 2022 and 2021, respectively. For 2023 cost recognition, based on GE Pension Plan assets at December 31, 2022, we have
assumed a 7.00% long-term expected return.

The Society of Actuaries issued new mortality improvement tables during 2021 that were used to update mortality assumptions in the U.S. These
changes in assumptions increased the December 31, 2021 U.S. pension and retiree benefit plans' obligations by $278 million.

The healthcare trend assumptions primarily apply to our pre-65 retiree medical plans. Most participants in our post-65 retiree plan have a fixed subsidy
and therefore are not subject to healthcare inflation.

We evaluate these critical assumptions at least annually on a plan and country-specific basis. We periodically evaluate other assumptions involving
demographics factors such as retirement age and turnover, and update them to reflect our actual experience and expectations for the future. Actual
results in any given year will often differ from actuarial assumptions because of economic and other factors. Differences between our actual results and
what we assumed are recorded in AOCI each period. These differences are amortized into earnings over the remaining average future service of
active participating employees or the expected life of inactive participants, as applicable. For the principal pension plans, gains and losses are
amortized using a straight-line method with a separate layer for each year’s gains and losses. For most other pension plans and principal retiree
benefit plans, gains and losses are amortized using a straight-line or a corridor amortization method.

SENSITIVITIES TO KEY ASSUMPTIONS. Fluctuations in discount rates can significantly impact pension cost and obligations. As of the December 31
measurement date, we would expect a 25 basis point decrease in discount rate would increase principal pension plan cost in the following year by
approximately $130 million and would also expect an increase in the principal pension plan projected benefit obligation at year-end by approximately
$1,300 million. The deficit sensitivity to the discount rate would be lower than the projected benefit obligation sensitivity as a result of the liability
hedging program incorporated in the plan's asset allocation. A 50 basis point decrease in the expected return on assets would increase principal
pension plan cost in the following year by approximately $260 million.

Plan fiduciaries of the GE Pension Plan set investment policies and strategies for the GE Pension Trust and oversee its investment allocation, which
includes selecting investment managers and setting long-term strategic targets. The plan fiduciaries' primary strategic investment objectives are
balancing investment risk and return and monitoring the plan’s liquidity position in order to meet the plan's near-term benefit payment and other cash
needs. The plan has incorporated de-risking objectives and liability hedging programs as part of its long-term investment strategy. The plan utilizes a
combination of long-dated corporate bonds, treasuries, strips and derivatives to implement its investment strategies as well as for hedging asset and
liability risks. Target allocation percentages are established at an asset class level by plan fiduciaries. Target allocation ranges are guidelines, not
limitations, and occasionally plan fiduciaries will approve allocations above or below a target range.

GE securities represented 0.7% and 0.6% of the GE Pension Trust assets at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The GE Pension Trust has a
broadly diversified portfolio of investments in equities, fixed income, private equities and real estate; these investments are both U.S. and non-U.S. in
nature.

NOTE 15. INCOME TAXES. GE files a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return which enables GE's businesses to use tax deductions and
credits of one member of the group to reduce the tax that otherwise would have been payable by another member of the group. The effective tax rate
reflects the benefit of these tax reductions in the consolidated return. Cash payments are made to GE's businesses for tax reductions and from GE's
businesses for tax increases.

Our businesses are subject to regulation under a wide variety of U.S. federal, state and foreign tax laws, regulations and policies. Changes to these
laws or regulations may affect our tax liability, return on investments and business operations. On August 16, 2022, the U.S. enacted the Inflation
Reduction Act that includes a new alternative minimum tax based upon financial statement income (book minimum tax), an excise tax on stock
buybacks and tax incentives for energy and climate initiatives, among other provisions. The new book minimum tax is expected to slow but not
eliminate the favorable tax impact of our deferred tax assets, resulting in higher cash tax in some years that would generate future tax credits. The
impact of the book minimum tax will depend on our facts in each year and anticipated guidance from the U.S. Department of the Treasury. Separately,
we continue to assess tax incentives in the legislation which could change our pre-tax or tax amounts and impact our tax rate.

UNRECOGNIZED TAX POSITIONS. Annually, we file over 2,600 income tax returns in over 270 global taxing jurisdictions. We are under examination
or engaged in tax litigation in many of these jurisdictions. The IRS is currently auditing our consolidated U.S. income tax returns for 2016-2018. In
December 2020, the IRS completed the audit of our consolidated U.S. income tax returns for 2014-2015. The Company recognized a continuing
operations benefit of $140 million plus an additional net interest benefit of $96 million. In addition, the Company recorded a benefit in discontinued
operations of $130 million of tax benefits and $25 million of net interest benefits. See Note 2 for further information.

In September 2021, GE resolved its dispute with the United Kingdom tax authority, HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) in connection with interest
deductions claimed by GE Capital for the years 2004-2015. As previously disclosed, HMRC had proposed to disallow interest deductions with a
potential impact of approximately $1,100 million, which included a possible assessment of tax and reduction of deferred tax assets, not including
interest and penalties. As part of the settlement, GE and HMRC agreed that a portion of the interest deductions claimed were disallowed, with no fault
or blame attributed to either party. The resolution concluded the dispute in its entirety without interest or penalties. The adjustments result in no current

We classify interest on tax deficiencies as interest expense; we classify income tax penalties as provision for income taxes. For the years ended
December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, $36 million, $17 million and $(30) million of interest expense (income), respectively, and $(26) million,
$(29) million and $(13) million of tax expense (income) related to penalties, respectively, were recognized in our Statement of Earnings (Loss).

DEFERRED INCOME TAXES. As part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (U.S. tax reform), the U.S. has enacted a minimum tax on foreign
earnings (global intangible low tax income). We have not made an accrual for the deferred tax aspects of this provision. We also have not provided
deferred taxes on cumulative net earnings of non-U.S. affiliates and associated companies of approximately $14 billion that have been reinvested
indefinitely. Given U.S. tax reform, substantially all of our prior unrepatriated net earnings were subject to U.S. tax and accordingly we expect to have
the ability to repatriate available non-U.S. cash without additional federal tax cost, and any foreign withholding tax on a repatriation to the U.S. would
potentially be partially offset by a U.S. foreign tax credit. Most of these earnings have been reinvested in active non-U.S. business operations and it is
not practicable to determine the income tax liability that would be payable if such earnings were not reinvested indefinitely. We reassess reinvestment
of earnings on an ongoing basis. In 2022, in connection with the execution of the Company’s plans to prepare for the spin-off of GE HealthCare, we
incurred $66 million of tax due to repatriation of previously reinvested earnings.

The total deferred tax asset as of December 31, 2022 includes $714 million related to the required capitalization of research costs for U.S. tax
purposes effective January 1, 2022. The Company has pending accounting method changes which, if approved, are expected to offset the impact of
this required capitalization. This deferred tax asset includes $279 million related to GE HealthCare, which became a deferred asset of the separate
company upon spin-off in the first quarter of 2023. In the event capitalization of research costs is adjusted through retroactive legislation effective for
2022, GE will record a tax provision benefit related to GE HealthCare research costs as a result of the benefit in the consolidated GE 2022 tax return
without payment under the Tax Matters Agreement.

The following table presents our net deferred tax assets and net deferred tax liabilities attributable to different tax jurisdictions or different tax paying
components.

Preferred stock. GE has 50 million authorized shares of preferred stock ($1.00 par value), of which 5,795,444 shares are outstanding as of December
31, 2022 and 5,939,875 shares are outstanding as of both December 31, 2021 and 2020. Preferred stock outstanding comprises $5,550 million of GE
Series D preferred stock, in addition to $245 million of existing GE Series A, B and C preferred stock. The total carrying value of GE preferred stock at
December 31, 2022 was $5,795 million. Dividends on GE preferred stock are payable semi-annually in June and December and accretion is recorded
on a quarterly basis. Dividends on GE preferred stock totaled $289 million, including cash dividends of $284 million, $237 million, including cash
dividends of $220 million, and $474 million, including cash dividends of $295 million, for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020,
respectively. On January 21, 2021, the GE Series D preferred stock became callable and its dividends converted from 5% fixed rate to 3-month LIBOR
plus 3.33%. As of the filing date of this Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, the GE Series D preferred stock has not been called. From
time to time we repurchase outstanding shares of preferred stock, and we repurchased $144 million of GE Series D preferred stock in the year ended
December 31, 2022.

Common stock. GE's authorized common stock consists of 1,650 million shares having a par value of $0.01 each, with 1,462 million shares issued.
Common stock shares outstanding were 1,089,107,878 and 1,099,027,213 at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. We repurchased
13.6 million and 0.5 million shares, for a total of $1,000 million and $36 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

Redeemable noncontrolling interests. Our redeemable noncontrolling interests, presented within All other liabilities in our Statement of Financial
Position, include common shares issued by our affiliates that are redeemable at the option of the holder of those interests and amounted to $132
million and $148 million, primarily related to our HealthCare segment, as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

NOTE 17. SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION. We grant stock options, restricted stock units and performance share units to employees under
the 2007 and 2022 Long-Term Incentive Plans. Grants made under all plans must be approved by the Management Development and Compensation
Committee of GE’s Board of Directors, which is composed entirely of independent directors. We record compensation expense for awards expected to
vest over the vesting period. We estimate forfeitures based on experience and adjust expense to reflect actual forfeitures. When options are exercised,
restricted stock units vest, and performance share awards are earned, we issue shares from treasury stock.

Stock options provide employees the opportunity to purchase GE shares in the future at the market price of our stock on the date the award is granted
(the strike price). The options become exercisable over the vesting period, typically three years, and expire 10 years from the grant date if not
exercised. Restricted stock units (RSU) provide an employee with the right to receive one share of GE stock when the restrictions lapse over the
vesting period. Upon vesting, each RSU is converted into one share of GE common stock for each unit. Performance share units (PSU) and
performance shares provide an employee with the right to receive shares of GE stock based upon achievement of certain performance or market
metrics. Upon vesting, each PSU earned is converted into shares of GE common stock. We value stock options using a Black-Scholes option pricing
model, RSUs using market price on grant date, and PSUs and performance shares using market price on grant date and a Monte Carlo simulation as
needed based on performance metrics.

(a) Outstanding stock awards not included in the computation of diluted earnings (loss) per share because their effect was antidilutive.

Our unvested restricted stock unit awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents are considered participating securities
and, therefore, are included in the computation of earnings per share pursuant to the two-class method. For the year ended December 31, 2022,
application of this treatment had an insignificant effect. For the year ended December 31, 2021, as a result of the loss from continuing operations,
losses were not allocated to the participating securities. For the year ended December 31, 2020, application of this treatment had an insignificant
effect.

For the year ended December 31, 2022, restructuring and other initiatives primarily included exit activities related to the restructuring program
announced in the fourth quarter reflecting lower Corporate shared-service and footprint needs as GE HealthCare prepared to become independent. It
also includes exit activities associated with the plan announced in October 2022 to undertake a restructuring program across our businesses planned
to be part of GE Vernova, primarily reflecting the selectivity strategy to operate in fewer markets and to simplify and standardize product variants at
Renewable Energy. We recorded total charges of $993 million, consisting of $416 million primarily in non-cash impairment, accelerated depreciation
and other charges, not reflected in the table above, and $578 million primarily in employee workforce reduction and contract related charges, which are
reflected in the table above. We incurred $492 million in cash outflows related to restructuring actions, primarily for employee severance payments.

For the year ended December 31, 2021, restructuring and other initiatives primarily included exit activities at our Power business related to our new
coal build wind-down actions, which included the exit of certain product lines, closing certain manufacturing and office facilities and other workforce
reduction programs. We recorded total charges of $819 million, consisting of $164 million primarily in non-cash impairment, accelerated depreciation
and other charges, not reflected in the table above, and $655 million primarily in employee workforce reduction charges, which are reflected in the
table above. We incurred $781 million in cash outflows related to restructuring actions, primarily for employee severance payments.

For the year ended December 31, 2020, restructuring and other initiatives primarily included actions related to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic
on our Aerospace business and Corporate cost reduction programs, which included closing certain manufacturing and office facilities and other
workforce reduction programs. We recorded total charges of $1,254 million, consisting of $394 million in non-cash asset impairments and other
charges, not reflected in the table above, and $860 million primarily in workforce reduction charges, which are reflected in the table above. We incurred
$1,175 million in cash outflows related to restructuring actions, primarily for employee severance payments.

SEPARATION COSTS. In November 2021, the company announced its plan to form three industry-leading, global public companies focused on the
growth sectors of aviation, healthcare, and energy. As a result of this plan, we expect to incur separation, transition, and operational costs, which will
depend on specifics of the transactions.




2022 FORM 10-K 74
We incurred pre-tax separation costs of $973 million, primarily related to employee costs, costs to establish certain stand-alone functions and
information technology systems, professional fees, and other transformation and transaction costs to transition to three stand-alone public companies,
for the year ended December 31, 2022. These costs are presented as separation costs in our consolidated Statement of Earnings (Loss). In addition,
we incurred $71 million of net tax benefit, including taxes associated with planned legal entity restructuring and changes to indefinite reinvestment of
foreign earnings, for the year ended December 31, 2022. We spent $261 million in cash for the year ended December 31, 2022.

DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING. Our policy requires that derivatives are used solely for managing risks and not for speculative purposes. We use
derivatives to manage currency risks related to foreign exchange, and interest rate and currency risk between financial assets and liabilities, and
certain equity investments and commodity prices.

We use cash flow hedges primarily to reduce or eliminate the effects of foreign exchange rate changes, net investment hedges to hedge investments
in foreign operations as well as fair value hedges to hedge the effects of interest rate and currency changes on debt it has issued. We also use
derivatives not designated as hedges from an accounting standpoint (and therefore we do not apply hedge accounting to the relationship) but
otherwise serve the same economic purpose as other hedging arrangements. We use economic hedges when we have exposures to currency
exchange risk for which we are unable to meet the requirements for hedge accounting or when changes in the carrying amount of the hedged item are
already recorded in earnings in the same period as the derivative making hedge accounting unnecessary. Even though the derivative is an effective
economic hedge, there may be a net effect on earnings in each period due to differences in the timing of earnings recognition between the derivative
and the hedged item.

FAIR VALUE HEDGES. As of December 31, 2022, all fair value hedges were terminated due to exposure management actions, including debt
maturities. Gains (losses) associated with the terminated hedging relationships will continue to amortize into interest expense until the bonds mature.
The cumulative amount of hedging adjustments of $1,240 million (all on discontinued hedging relationships) was included in the carrying amount of the
previously hedged liability of $9,933 million. At December 31, 2021, the cumulative amount of hedging adjustments of $2,072 million (including $2,073
million on discontinued hedging relationships) was included in the carrying amount of the previously hedged liability of $16,819 million. The cumulative
amount of hedging adjustments was primarily recorded in long-term borrowings.

(a) Primarily related to currency exchange contracts.
(b) The carrying value of foreign currency debt designated as net investment hedges was $3,329 million and $4,061 million at December 31, 2022 and
    2021, respectively. The total reclassified from AOCI into earnings was zero, $(87) million and zero for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021
    and 2020, respectively.

Changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges are recorded in AOCI and recorded in earnings in the period in which the hedged transaction occurs.
The total amount in AOCI related to cash flow hedges of forecasted transactions was a $111 million loss at December 31, 2022. We expect to
reclassify $106 million of loss to earnings in the next 12 months contemporaneously with the earnings effects of the related forecasted transactions. At
December 31, 2022, the maximum term of derivative instruments that hedge forecasted transactions was approximately 12 years.

(b) SG&A was primarily driven by hedges of deferred incentive compensation, Other Income (loss) by hedges of Baker Hughes equity sale, and Debt

COUNTERPARTY CREDIT RISK. Our exposures to counterparties (including accrued interest), net of collateral we held, was $308 million and $564
million at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. Counterparties' exposures to our derivative liability (including accrued interest),
net of collateral posted by us, was $505 million and $159 million at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively.

NOTE 23. VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES. In our Statement of Financial Position, we have assets of $401 million and $491 million and
liabilities of $206 million and $206 million at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively, in consolidated Variable Interest Entities (VIEs).
These entities were created to help our customers facilitate or finance the purchase of GE equipment and services and have no features that could
expose us to losses that would significantly exceed the difference between the consolidated assets and liabilities.

Our investments in unconsolidated VIEs were $5,917 million and $5,034 million at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. Of these
investments, $1,481 million and $1,481 million were owned by EFS, comprising equity method investments, primarily renewable energy tax equity
investments, at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. In addition, $4,219 million and $3,333 million were owned by our run-off
insurance operations, primarily comprising of equity method investments at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. The increase in
investments in unconsolidated VIEs in our run-off insurance operations reflects strategic initiatives to invest in higher-yielding asset classes. Our
maximum exposure to loss in respect of unconsolidated VIEs is increased by our commitments to make additional investments in these entities
described in Note 24.

NOTE 24. COMMITMENTS, GUARANTEES, PRODUCT WARRANTIES AND OTHER LOSS CONTINGENCIES
COMMITMENTS. We had total investment commitments of $3,877 million at December 31, 2022. The commitments primarily comprise investments by
our run-off insurance operations in investment securities and other assets of $3,778 million and included within these commitments are obligations to
make investments in unconsolidated VIEs of $3,773 million. See Note 23 for further information.

As of December 31, 2022, in our Aerospace segment, we have committed to provide financing assistance of $2,390 million of future customer
acquisitions of aircraft equipped with our engines.

GUARANTEES. At December 31, 2022, we were committed under the following guarantee arrangements:

Credit support. We have provided $1,143 million of credit support on behalf of certain customers or associated companies, predominantly joint
ventures and partnerships, using arrangements such as standby letters of credit and performance guarantees. The liability for such credit support was
$32 million.

Indemnification agreements - Continuing Operations. We have $534 million of indemnification commitments, including representations and
warranties in sales of business assets, for which we recorded a liability of $80 million.

Indemnification agreements - Discontinued Operations. We have provided specific indemnities to buyers of assets of our business that, in the
aggregate, represent a maximum potential claim of $717 million with related reserves of $77 million.

PRODUCT WARRANTIES. We provide for estimated product warranty expenses when we sell the related products. Because warranty estimates are

(a) The increase in current-year provisions is primarily related to Renewable Energy, which was substantially all due to changes in estimates on pre-
    existing warranties and related to the deployment of repairs and other corrective measures.

LEGAL MATTERS. In the normal course of our business, we are involved from time to time in various arbitrations, class actions, commercial litigation,
investigations and other legal, regulatory or governmental actions, including the significant matters described below that could have a material impact
on our results of operations. In many proceedings, including the specific matters described below, it is inherently difficult to determine whether any loss
is probable or even reasonably possible or to estimate the size or range of the possible loss, and accruals for legal matters are not recorded until a
loss for a particular matter is considered probable and reasonably estimable. Given the nature of legal matters and the complexities involved, it is often
difficult to predict and determine a meaningful estimate of loss or range of loss until we know, among other factors, the particular claims involved, the
likelihood of success of our defenses to those claims, the damages or other relief sought, how discovery or other procedural considerations will affect
the outcome, the settlement posture of other parties and other factors that may have a material effect on the outcome. For these matters, unless
otherwise specified, we do not believe it is possible to provide a meaningful estimate of loss at this time. Moreover, it is not uncommon for legal matters
to be resolved over many years, during which time relevant developments and new information must be continuously evaluated.

Alstom legacy legal matters. In 2015, we acquired the Steam Power, Renewables and Grid businesses from Alstom, which prior to our acquisition
were the subject of significant cases involving anti-competitive activities and improper payments. We had reserves of $455 million and $567 million at
December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, for legal and compliance matters related to the legacy business practices that were the subject of cases in
various jurisdictions. Allegations in these cases relate to claimed anti-competitive conduct or improper payments in the pre-acquisition period as the
source of legal violations or damages. Given the significant litigation and compliance activity related to these matters and our ongoing efforts to resolve
them, it is difficult to assess whether the disbursements will ultimately be consistent with the reserve established. The estimation of this reserve may
not reflect the full range of uncertainties and unpredictable outcomes inherent in litigation and investigations of this nature, and at this time we are
unable to develop a meaningful estimate of the range of reasonably possible additional losses beyond the amount of this reserve. Factors that can
affect the ultimate amount of losses associated with these and related matters include the way cooperation is assessed and valued, prosecutorial
discretion in the determination of damages, formulas for determining disgorgement, fines or penalties, the duration and amount of legal and
investigative resources applied, political and social influences within each jurisdiction, and tax consequences of any settlements or previous
deductions, among other considerations. Actual losses arising from claims in these and related matters could exceed the amount provided.

Shareholder and related lawsuits. Since November 2017, several putative shareholder class actions under the federal securities laws have been
filed against GE and certain affiliated individuals and consolidated into a single action currently pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern
District of New York (the Hachem case). In October 2019, the lead plaintiff filed a fifth amended consolidated class action complaint naming as
defendants GE and current and former GE executive officers. It alleges violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) and Rule 10b-5 of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 related to insurance reserves and accounting for long-term service agreements and seeks damages on behalf of shareholders
who acquired GE stock between February 27, 2013 and January 23, 2018. GE filed a motion to dismiss in December 2019. In January 2021, the court
granted defendants’ motion to dismiss as to the majority of the claims. Specifically, the court dismissed all claims related to insurance reserves, as well
as all claims related to accounting for long-term service agreements, with the exception of certain claims about historic disclosures related to factoring
in the Power business that survive as to GE and its former CFO Jeffrey S. Bornstein. All other individual defendants have been dismissed from the
case. In April 2022, the court granted the plaintiffs' motion for class certification for shareholders who acquired stock between February 26, 2016 and
January 23, 2018, and granted the plaintiffs’ request to amend their complaint. In September 2022, GE filed a motion for summary judgment on the
plaintiffs' remaining claims.

Since February 2018, multiple shareholder derivative lawsuits have been filed against current and former GE executive officers and members of GE’s
Board of Directors and GE (as nominal defendant). These lawsuits have alleged violations of securities laws, breaches of fiduciary duties, unjust
enrichment, waste of corporate assets, abuse of control and gross mismanagement, although the specific matters underlying the allegations in the
lawsuits have varied. Two shareholder derivative lawsuits are currently pending: the Lindsey and Priest/Tola cases, which were filed in New York state
court. The allegations in these two cases relate to substantially the same facts as those underlying the Hachem case. The plaintiffs seek unspecified
damages and improvements in GE’s corporate governance and internal procedures. The Lindsey case has been stayed by agreement of the parties,
and GE filed a motion to dismiss the Priest/Tola complaint in March 2021.




2022 FORM 10-K 78
In July 2018, a putative class action (the Mahar case) was filed in New York state court naming as defendants GE, former GE executive officers, a
former member of GE’s Board of Directors and KPMG. It alleged violations of Sections 11, 12 and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933 based on alleged
misstatements related to insurance reserves and performance of GE’s business segments in GE Stock Direct Plan registration statements and
documents incorporated therein by reference and seeks damages on behalf of shareholders who acquired GE stock between July 20, 2015 and July
19, 2018 through the GE Stock Direct Plan. In February 2019, this case was dismissed. In March 2019, plaintiffs filed an amended derivative complaint
naming the same defendants. In April 2019, GE filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint. In October 2019, the court denied GE's motion to
dismiss and stayed the case pending the outcome of the Hachem case. In November 2019, the plaintiffs moved to re-argue to challenge the stay, and
GE cross-moved to re-argue the denial of the motion to dismiss and filed a notice of appeal. The court denied both motions for re-argument, and in
November 2020, the Appellate Division First Department affirmed the court's denial of GE's motion to dismiss. In January 2021, GE filed a motion for
leave to appeal to the New York Court of Appeals, and that motion was denied in March 2021.

In February 2019, a securities action (the Touchstone case) was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York naming as
defendants GE and current and former GE executive officers. It alleges violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
and Section 1707.43 of the Ohio Securities Act and common law fraud based on alleged misstatements regarding insurance reserves, GE Power’s
revenue recognition practices related to long term service agreements, GE’s acquisition of Alstom, and the goodwill recognized in connection with that
transaction. The lawsuit seeks damages on behalf of six institutional investors who purchased GE common stock between August 1, 2014 and October
30, 2018 and rescission of those purchases. In May 2021, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, and GE in June 2021 filed a motion to dismiss that
complaint. In September 2022, the court granted GE’s motion to the dismiss the plaintiffs’ case with no opportunity to replead their case. In January
2023, the plaintiffs filed an appeal of the court’s dismissal of their case with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.

As previously reported by Baker Hughes, in March 2019, two derivative lawsuits were filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery naming as defendants
GE, directors of Baker Hughes (including former members of GE’s Board of Directors and current and former GE executive officers) and Baker Hughes
(as nominal defendant), and the court issued an order consolidating these two actions (the Schippnick case). The complaint as amended in May 2019
alleges, among other things, that GE and the Baker Hughes directors breached their fiduciary duties, and that GE was unjustly enriched by entering
into transactions and agreements related to GE's sales of approximately 12% of its ownership interest in Baker Hughes in November 2018. The
complaint seeks declaratory relief, disgorgement of profits, an award of damages, pre- and post-judgment interest and attorneys’ fees and costs. In
May 2019, the plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed their claims against the directors who were members of the Baker Hughes Conflicts Committee and a
former Baker Hughes director. In October 2019, the Court denied the remaining defendants’ motions to dismiss, except with respect to the unjust
enrichment claim against GE, which has been dismissed. In November 2019, the defendants filed their answer to the complaint, and a special litigation
committee of the Baker Hughes Board of Directors moved for an order staying all proceedings in this action pending completion of the committee's
investigation of the allegations and claims asserted in the complaint. In October 2020, the special litigation committee filed a report with the Court
recommending that the derivative action be terminated. In January 2021, the special committee filed a motion to terminate the action.

GE Retirement Savings Plan class actions. Four putative class action lawsuits have been filed regarding the oversight of the GE RSP, and those
class actions have been consolidated into a single action in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts. The consolidated complaint names
as defendants GE, GE Asset Management, current and former GE and GE Asset Management executive officers and employees who served on
fiduciary bodies responsible for aspects of the GE RSP during the class period. Like similar lawsuits that have been brought against other companies
in recent years, this action alleges that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) in
their oversight of the GE RSP, principally by retaining five proprietary funds that plaintiffs allege were underperforming as investment options for plan
participants and by charging higher management fees than some alternative funds. The plaintiffs seek unspecified damages on behalf of a class of GE
RSP participants and beneficiaries from September 26, 2011 through the date of any judgment. In August and December 2018, the court issued orders
dismissing one count of the complaint and denying GE's motion to dismiss the remaining counts. In September 2022, both GE and the plaintiffs filed
motions for summary judgment on the remaining claims.

Bank BPH. As previously reported, Bank BPH, along with other Polish banks, has been subject to ongoing litigation in Poland related to its portfolio of
floating rate residential mortgage loans, with cases brought by individual borrowers seeking relief related to their foreign currency indexed or
denominated mortgage loans in various courts throughout Poland. At December 31, 2022, approximately 85% of the Bank BPH portfolio is indexed to
or denominated in foreign currencies (primarily Swiss francs), and the total portfolio had a carrying value, net of reserves, of $1,199 million. We
continue to observe an increase in the number of lawsuits being brought against Bank BPH and other banks in Poland, and we expect this to continue
in future reporting periods.




                                                                                                                                      2022 FORM 10-K 79
We estimate potential losses for Bank BPH in connection with borrower litigation cases that are pending by recording legal reserves, as well as in
connection with potential future cases or other adverse developments as part of our ongoing valuation of the Bank BPH portfolio, which we record at
the lower of cost or fair value, less cost to sell. The total amount of estimated losses was $1,359 million and $755 million at December 31, 2022 and
2021, respectively. We update our assumptions underlying the amount of estimated losses based primarily on the number of lawsuits filed and
estimated to be filed in the future, whether liability will be established in lawsuits and the nature of the remedy ordered by courts if liability is
established. The increase in the amount of estimated losses during 2022 was driven primarily by increases in the number of lawsuits filed and
estimated to be filed in the future and increased findings of liability. We expect the trends we have previously reported of an increasing number of
lawsuits being filed, more findings of liability and more severe remedies being ordered against Polish banks (including Bank BPH) to continue in future
reporting periods, although Bank BPH is unable at this time to develop a meaningful estimate of reasonably possible losses associated with active and
inactive Bank BPH mortgage loans beyond the amounts currently recorded. Additional factors may also affect our estimated losses over time,
including: potentially significant judicial decisions or binding resolutions by the European Court of Justice (ECJ) or the Polish Supreme Court; the
impact of any of these or other future or recent decisions or resolutions (including an expected ECJ ruling that could adversely impact the remedy cost
to Polish banks upon a finding of liability, and the Polish Supreme Court binding resolution delivered verbally in May 2021 with written reasoning issued
in July 2021) on how Polish courts will interpret and apply the law in particular cases and how borrower behavior may change in response, neither of
which are known immediately upon the issuance of a decision or resolution; financial, economic and other conditions in Poland that may adversely
affect borrowers; uncertainty related to a proposal by the Chairman of the Polish Financial Supervisory Authority in December 2020 that banks
voluntarily offer borrowers an opportunity to convert their foreign currency indexed or denominated mortgage loans to Polish zlotys using an exchange
rate applicable at the date of loan origination, and about the various settlement strategies or other approaches that Polish banks have increasingly
adopted or will adopt, or that Bank BPH may adopt in the future, in response to this proposal or other factors, the approaches that regulators and other
government authorities will adopt in response, the receptivity of borrowers to settlement offers; and the financial and capital impact on banks that adopt
settlement programs; and any potential legislation that may be passed in Poland relating to foreign exchange indexed or denominated mortgage loans.
In addition, there is continued uncertainty arising from investigations of the Polish Office of Competition and Consumer Protection (UOKiK), including
existing or anticipated UOKiK and court decisions resulting from those investigations, particularly UOKiK's investigation into the adequacy of disclosure
of foreign exchange risk by banks (including BPH) and the legality under Polish law of unlimited foreign exchange risk on customers. Future adverse
developments related to any of the foregoing, or other adverse developments such as actions by regulators, legislators or other governmental
authorities (including UOKiK), likely would have a material adverse effect on Bank BPH and the carrying value of its mortgage loan portfolio as well as
result in additional required capital contributions to Bank BPH or significant losses beyond the amounts that we currently estimate.


ENVIRONMENTAL, HEALTH AND SAFETY MATTERS. Our operations, like operations of other companies engaged in similar businesses, involve
the use, disposal and cleanup of substances regulated under environmental protection laws and nuclear decommissioning regulations. We have
obligations for ongoing and future environmental remediation activities, such as the Housatonic River cleanup described below, and may incur
additional liabilities in connection with previously remediated sites, such as natural resource damages for the Hudson River where GE completed
dredging in 2019. Additionally, like many other industrial companies, we and our subsidiaries are defendants in various lawsuits related to alleged
worker exposure to asbestos or other hazardous materials. Liabilities for environmental remediation, nuclear decommissioning and worker exposure
claims exclude possible insurance recoveries. It is reasonably possible that our exposure will exceed amounts accrued. However, due to uncertainties
about the status of laws, regulations, technology and information related to individual sites and lawsuits, such amounts are not reasonably estimable.
Total reserves related to environmental remediation, nuclear decommissioning and worker exposure claims were $2,686 million and $2,660 million at
December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

As previously reported, in 2000, GE and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) entered into a consent decree relating to PCB cleanup of the
Housatonic River in Massachusetts. In October 2016, EPA issued its final decision pursuant to the consent decree. In January 2018, the EPA’s
Environmental Appeals Board (EAB) remanded the decision back to the EPA with instruction to reissue a revised final remedy. After successful
mediation with key stakeholders (including EPA, GE, certain towns, and environmental groups), public comment and further review by the EAB, the
final revised permit (issued in January 2021) became effective in March 2022. In May 2022, two environmental advocacy groups petitioned the U.S.
Court of Appeals for the First Circuit to review the EPA’s final permit. As of December 31, 2022 and based on its assessment of current facts and
circumstances and its defenses, GE believes that it has recorded adequate reserves to cover future obligations associated with the proposed final
remedy.

Expenditures for site remediation, nuclear decommissioning and worker exposure claims amounted to approximately $231 million, $193 million and
$180 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. We presently expect that such expenditures will be approximately
$250 million and $300 million in 2023 and 2024, respectively.

REMAINING PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION. As of December 31, 2022, the aggregate amount of the contracted revenues allocated to our
unsatisfied (or partially unsatisfied) performance obligations was $250,997 million. We expect to recognize revenue as we satisfy our remaining
performance obligations as follows: 1) equipment-related remaining performance obligation of $48,936 million of which 59%, 81% and 98% is expected
to be recognized within 1, 2 and 5 years, respectively, and the remaining thereafter; and 2) services-related remaining performance obligations of
$202,061 million of which 13%, 46%, 70% and 84% is expected to be recognized within 1, 5, 10 and 15 years, respectively, and the remaining
thereafter. Contract modifications could affect both the timing to complete as well as the amount to be received as we fulfill the related remaining
performance obligations.

Total sales of equipment and services to agencies of the U.S. Government were 6%, 6% and 7% of total revenues for the years ended December 31,
2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Within our Aerospace segment, defense-related sales were 5%, 5% and 6% of total revenues for the years ended
December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

The decrease in continuing assets in 2022 was primarily driven by decreases in estimated fair value of our debt securities, depreciation and
amortization on property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, including the Steam asset sale impairment, and the effects of a stronger U.S.
dollar. Property, plant and equipment – net associated with operations based in the United States were $7,508 million and $8,411 million at December
31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Property, plant and equipment – net associated with operations based outside the United States were $6,970 million
and $7,198 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

NOTE 26. SUMMARIZED FINANCIAL INFORMATION. We account for our remaining interest in Baker Hughes (comprising 7 million shares
with approximately 1% ownership interest as of December 31, 2022) at fair value. As of November 3, 2021, our investment in BKR ownership reduced
below 20%, and as a result, we no longer have significant influence in BKR. The fair value of our interest in Baker Hughes at December 31, 2022 and
2021 was $207 million and $4,010 million, respectively. We recognized a realized and unrealized pre-tax gain of $912 million ($702 million after-tax)
based on a share price of $29.53, a realized and unrealized pre-tax gain of $938 million ($696 million after-tax) based on a share price of $24.06, and
a realized and unrealized pre-tax loss of $2,037 million ($1,562 million after-tax) based on a share price of $20.85 for the years ended December 31,
2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The 2022 gain, 2021 gain and 2020 loss included a $109 million pre-tax derivative gain, a $129 million pre-tax
derivative gain and a $54 million pre-tax derivative loss, respectively, associated with the forward sale of Baker Hughes shares pursuant to our
previously announced program to monetize our Baker Hughes position. During the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, we completed
forward sales of 160 million, 183 million and 28 million shares and received proceeds of $4,717 million, $4,145 million and $417 million, respectively. In
January 2023, we sold our remaining 7 million shares and received net proceeds of $216 million. See Notes 2, 3 and 19 for further information.
Summarized financial information of Baker Hughes is as follows.

partial consideration in conjunction with the GECAS transaction, for which we have adopted the fair value option. The fair value of our interest in
AerCap, including the note, at December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $7,403 million and $8,287 million, respectively. We recognized an unrealized pre-tax
loss of $865 million ($1,052 million after-tax) based on a share price of $58.32 and an unrealized pre-tax and after-tax gain of $711 million based on a
share price of $65.42 related to our interest in AerCap for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. See Notes 2, 3 and 19 for

Earnings-per-share amounts are computed independently each quarter for earnings (loss) from continuing operations, earnings (loss) from
discontinued operations and net earnings (loss). As a result, the sum of each quarter’s per-share amount may not equal the total per-share amount for
the respective year; and the sum of per-share amounts from continuing operations and discontinued operations may not equal the total per-share
amounts for net earnings (loss) for the respective quarters.

NOTE 28. SUBSEQUENT EVENT. On January 3, 2023 (the Distribution Date), GE completed the previously announced separation of its
HealthCare business, into a separate, independent publicly traded company, GE HealthCare Technologies, Inc. (GE HealthCare). The Separation was
structured as a tax-free spin-off, and was achieved through GE's pro-rata distribution of approximately 80.1% of the outstanding shares of GE
HealthCare to holders of GE common stock. On the Distribution Date, each holder of record of GE common stock received one share of GE
HealthCare common stock for every three shares of GE common stock held. As a result of the Separation, GE HealthCare became an independent
public company that trades under the symbol “GEHC” on The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC and we will no longer consolidate GE HealthCare into our
financial results.

In connection with the Separation, the historical results of GE HealthCare and certain assets and liabilities included in the Separation will be reported in
GE's consolidated financial statements as discontinued operations beginning in the first quarter of 2023. GE will prospectively measure its retained
ownership interest of approximately 19.9% in GE HealthCare common stock at fair value. This equity ownership interest and the related earnings
impact from subsequent changes in its fair value will be recognized in continuing operations. In addition, we expect to fully monetize our stake in GE
HealthCare over time.

Also in connection with the Separation, the Company entered into various agreements to effect the Separation and provide a framework for the
relationship between GE and GE HealthCare, including a Separation and Distribution Agreement (SDA), a Tax Matters Agreement and a Transition
Services Agreement (TSA).

In connection with the Separation and as a result of the legal split of certain plans as set forth in Note 13, net liabilities of approximately $4.0 billion
associated with GE's postretirement benefit plans, including a portion of the principal pension plans, the principal retiree benefit plans and other
pension plans were transferred to GE HealthCare. Deferred compensation arrangements and other compensation and benefits obligations of
approximately $0.7 billion were also transferred to GE HealthCare. The legal split and transfer of the plans and the related liabilities and obligations to
GE HealthCare will impact our assumptions and projections used to determine the funding and costs of GE’s remaining plans.

In connection with the Separation, GE received $1.5 billion of cash funded by GE HealthCare's additional $2.0 billion of indebtedness incurred on
January 3, 2023.




                                                                                                                                          2022 FORM 10-K 85
Following the Separation, GE has remaining performance and bank guarantees on behalf of its former HealthCare business. Under the SDA, GE
HealthCare is obligated to use reasonable best efforts to replace GE as the guarantor on or terminate all such credit support instruments. Until such
termination or replacement, in the event of non-fulfillment of contractual obligations by the relevant obligor(s), GE could be obligated to make payments
under the applicable instruments. Under the SDA, GE HealthCare is obligated to reimburse and indemnify GE for any such payments. As of January 3,
2023, GE’s maximum aggregate exposure under such credit support instruments is approximately $0.5 billion. Most of these guarantees are not
expected to remain in effect as of December 2023. In addition, GE also has an obligation under the TSA to indemnify GE HealthCare for certain of its
technology costs of approximately $0.1 billion, which are expected to be incurred by GE HealthCare within the first year following the Separation.

ITEM 1. BUSINESS

OVERVIEW

We were incorporated under the name Alazzio Entertainment Corp. on January 24, 2014, under the laws of the State of Nevada. Our original business
plan was to operate photo booth rentals.

On April 3, 2015, a change in control occurred by virtue of our company’s largest shareholder, Dmitri Kapsumun selling 900,000 shares (split
adjusted) of our common stock to Rise Fast Limited, a Hong Kong corporation. Such shares represented 71.77% of our total issued and outstanding
shares of common stock. As part of the sale of the shares, Rise Fast Limited arranged with the resigning member of our company’s Board of
Directors, to appoint Mr. Huang Yu as the sole officer and director of our company.

On April 16, 2015, we filed a Certificate of Amendment with the Nevada Secretary of State (the “Nevada SOS”) whereby we amended our Articles
of Incorporation by increasing our authorized number of shares of common stock from 75 million to 300 million (not adjusted for the one (1) for one
hundred (100) stock split) and increasing all of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock at a ratio of fifteen (15) shares for every one (1)
share held. Our Board of Directors approved this amendment on April 15, 2015 and shareholders holding 71.77% of our issued and outstanding
shares approved this amendment via a written consent executed on April 16, 2015.

Effective April 29, 2015 we changed our name to America Resources Exploration Inc. by way of a merger with our wholly-owned subsidiary,
incorporated solely for the purpose of the change of name.

On June 10, 2015, we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with Zheng Xiangwu, a resident of Guang Dong Province, China, whereby we
issued 40,000 million shares of its common stock in exchange for rights to certain oil and gas leases located in Frio and Atascosa Counties, Texas,
consisting of a total of 714 total acres of land, two (2) working wells and a total of seven (7) wells (the “Leases”). The acquisition of the Leases
pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement was completed on June 1, 2015. As a result of the completion of this acquisition, 40,000 shares of our
company’s common stock were issued to Mr. Zheng Xiangwu, who owns our company’s largest shareholder, Rise Fast Limited. The number of
shares issued to Mr. Zheng was determined by valuing the Leases at $160,000 and valuing our company’s stock at $0.04 per share. At the completion
of the Asset Purchase Agreement, we entered into the oil and gas industry.

On June 11, 2015, we entered into various assignment agreements with Mr. Zheng for the acquisition of multiple oil and gas leases and overriding
royalty interests (“ORR’s”) as set out in the table below. From July 6, 2015 through July 9, 2015, we completed the acquisition of such oil and gas
leases and ORR’s, whereby we issued a total of 6,500 shares of our common stock to Mr. Zheng.

On August 13, 2015 we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with Inceptus Resources, LLC whereby our company acquired a 78% net revenue
interest in 200 acres located in Callahan County, Texas, and a 78% net revenue interest in 522 acres also located in Callahan County, Texas.

On January 20, 2016, we changed our name to PetroGas Company, by way of a merger with our wholly-owned subsidiary, incorporated solely for the
purpose of the change of name. In addition, we amended our Articles of Incorporation for a reverse stock split by decreasing all of our issued and
outstanding shares of common stock at a ratio one (1) new for one hundred (100) old shares of common stock. The reverse stock split was approved
by our directors and shareholders holding 68.65% of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock on January 13, 2016 and the reverse stock
split became effective with FINRA on March 7, 2016. The change of name resulted in a change of trading symbol to “PTCO”.

On September 13, 2017, we filed a Certificate of Amendment with the Nevada Secretary of State whereby we amended our Articles of Incorporation
by decreasing all of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock at a ratio of one (1) share for every one hundred (100) shares held. Our
Board of Directors approved the Amendment on July 21, 2017 and Shareholders holding 75.95% of our company’s shares approved the Amendment
via written consent executed on July 21, 2017, with an effective date of October 5, 2017.

On February 20, 2019 a majority of our shareholders and our board of directors approved a resolution to effect a reverse stock split of our issued and
outstanding shares of common stock on a one (1) new for 100 old basis. The reverse split was approved by FINRA with an effective date of March
19, 2019. As a result of the reverse split, our issued and outstanding shares of common stock decreased from 30,099,230 to 300,993 shares of
common stock. Our authorized capital remained unchanged.

Our principal executive offices are located at 2800 Post Oak Boulevard, Suite 4100, Houston, Texas 77056. Our telephone number is (832) 899-8597.

We have never declared bankruptcy, been in receivership, or involved in any kind of legal proceeding.

We hold a 94% interest in Seabourn Oil Company, LLC, a Texas LLC.

CURRENT INVESTMENTS

On June 12, 2015, we acquired three (3) producing leases covering 714 acres situated in Atascosa and Frio Counties, Texas, located in the Eagle Ford
Shale formation - the Jane Burns “C” (“Burns”), the Theo Rogers “C”, and the Theo Rogers “A” & “D” (“Rogers”) Leases. We acquired a 99.5%
working interest (74.625% net revenue interest) in each lease.

The Burns and Rogers Leases provide exploration and production opportunities in the Kyote Field pay zone, very near the Eagle Ford Shale play
with access to available rig crews and other vendor-servicers, due to their close proximity to San Antonio, Texas.


                                                                          5

Table of Contents

The Burns and Rogers Leases hold collectively seven (7) oil wells, but none of which are operating wells. Although our company’s management and
industry professionals believed at the time that they were acquired that our company could double or triple previous production on these wells,
depressed oil prices indicate that the cost to bring these wells online an uneconomical venture.

On November 30, 2016, we acquired various royalty interests in Texas for $10,485. On December 14, 2016, we acquired two oil and gas leases in
Ohio for $2,705. On January 1, 2017, our company acquired the lease for three oil and gas properties for $4,975.

Future Operations

We are actively seeking to acquire producing and non-producing leases that will allow us to explore and drill in high-profile pay zones.
We intend to raise capital at a low cost from private placements so that we may acquire numerous additional leases, and to commence drilling, and
taking advantage of the inevitable uptick in oil prices to come.

In the current climate, our company believes that there are a very large number of oil & gas leases under distress due to the depressed gas prices and
that we can strategically position our company to acquire as many of these leases as possible at a discount to market value, hence creating
shareholder value.

We are planning an exploration strategy to drill new wells on the current Leases, as well as acquire deeper rights in order to drill some of the wells at
great depths. We expect that reservoirs at those depths could yield a very high daily output of oil.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

Risks Related to Our Oil and Gas Operations

If our exploration and development programs prove unsuccessful, we may not be able to continue operations.

An investment in our company should be considered highly speculative due to the nature of our involvement in the exploration, development and
production of oil and natural gas. Oil and gas exploration involves a high degree of risk, which even a combination of experience, knowledge and
careful evaluation may not be able to overcome. Exploratory drilling is subject to numerous risks, including the risk that no commercially productive
oil and natural gas reservoirs will be encountered. The cost to drill, complete and operate wells is often uncertain, and drilling operations may be
curtailed, delayed or cancelled as a result of a variety of factors including unexpected drilling conditions, abnormal pressures, equipment failures,
premature declines of reservoirs, blow-outs, sour gas releases, fires, spills or other accidents, as well as weather conditions, compliance with
governmental requirements, delays in receiving governmental approvals or permits, unexpected environmental issues and shortages or delays in the
delivery of equipment. Our inability to drill wells that produce commercial quantities of oil and natural gas would have a material adverse effect on
our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Future oil and gas acquisitions or exploration may involve unprofitable efforts, not only from dry wells, but from wells that are productive but do not
produce sufficient net revenues to return a profit after exploration, drilling, operating and other costs. Completion of wells does not ensure a profit on
the investment or recovery of exploration, drilling, completion and operating costs. Drilling hazards or environmental damage could greatly increase
the cost of operations, and various field operating conditions may adversely affect production. Adverse conditions include delays in obtaining
governmental approvals or consents, shut-ins of connected wells resulting from extreme weather conditions, insufficient storage or transportation
capacity or other geological and mechanical conditions.

Fluctuations in commodity prices could have a material impact on our revenues, which would affect our profitability.
Commodity price risk related to conventional crude oil prices could become our most significant market risk exposure if we achieve oil and natural
gas production. Crude oil prices are influenced by such worldwide factors as the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries actions, political
events and supply and demand fundamentals. At this time, we cannot accurately predict these fluctuations because we do not know when we will
commence generating revenues from our oil and gas operations. Furthermore, we cannot estimate, at this time, the impact of commodity price
fluctuations until we can predict the level of revenues.

Application, interpretation and enforcement of government tax and other legislation is inconsistent making it difficult for us to ensure that we are
compliant which could lead to penalties.

The tax environment in the United States is subject to change, inconsistent application, interpretation and enforcement. Non-compliance with US
laws and regulations can lead to the imposition of penalties and interest. We intend to make every effort to conform to these laws and regulations.
However, our interpretations and those of our advisors may not be the same as those of government officials, which could lead to penalties and
interest.

We face competition which could adversely affect our ability to significantly penetrate the oil and gas market in the U.S., which may make it
difficult to attain profitability.

The oil and gas market in the U.S. is highly competitive. Most of the competitors are major international energy industry operators. These
competitors have various advantages over us, including:

      -     Substantially greater financial resources, which gives them greater access to the types of distressed properties that we are targeting and
            flexibility when developing their exploration and drilling programs;
      -     greater recognition in the industry, which influences a potential partners’ decision to participate in programs;
      -     larger operations, which provides economies of scale and operating efficiencies not available to us;
      -     longer operating histories; and
      -     more established relationships with strategic partners.


                                                                           7

Table of Contents

We may be unable to successfully compete with these established competitors, which may adversely affect our ability to acquire additional properties
and thus impact our ability to generate revenue.

Compliance, interpretation and enforcement with evolving environmental laws and regulations may impact our expenses in a negative manner,
which would directly impact our profit margins.

Extensive national, regional and local environmental laws and regulations in the U.S. will affect our operations. These laws and regulations set
various standards regulating certain aspects of health and environmental quality which provide for user fees, penalties and other liabilities for the
violation of these standards and establish, in some circumstances, obligations to remediate current and former facilities and off-site locations. We
believe we are currently in compliance with all existing environmental laws and regulations. However, as new environmental laws and legislation are
enacted and the old laws are repealed, interpretation, application and enforcement of the laws may become inconsistent. Compliance in the future
could require significant expenditures, which would directly impact our profit margins.

Drilling, exploring for and producing oil is a high risk activity with many uncertainties that could adversely affect our business, financial
condition and results of operations.

Our future financial condition and results of operations will depend on the success of our drilling, exploration and production activities. These
activities are subject to numerous risks beyond our control, including the risk that drilling will not result in economic oil production or increases in
reserves. Many factors may curtail, delay or cancel our scheduled development projects, including:

      ·     decline in oil prices;
      ·     compliance with governmental regulations, which may include limitations on hydraulic fracturing, access to water or the discharge of
            greenhouse gases;
      ·     inadequate capital resources;
      ·     inability to attract and retain qualified personnel;
      ·     unavailability or high cost of drilling and completion equipment, services or materials;
      ·     unexpected drilling conditions, pressure or irregularities in formations, equipment failures or accidents;
      ·     adverse weather conditions;
      ·     surface access restrictions;
      ·     mechanical difficulties.

Oil prices are volatile, and a decline in oil prices could significantly affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and our
ability to meet our capital expenditure requirements and financial commitments.
Our revenues, profitability and cash flow will depend substantially upon the prices and demand for oil. The markets for this commodity are volatile,
and even relatively modest drops in prices can affect significantly our financial results and impede our growth. Prices for oil fluctuate widely in
response to relatively minor changes in the supply and demand for these commodities, market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors beyond
our control, such as:

      ·     domestic and foreign supply of oil;
      ·     domestic and foreign consumer demand for oil;
      ·     overall United States and global economic conditions;
      ·     price and availability of alternative fuels;
      ·     governmental regulations;
      ·     technological advances affecting oil consumption.

Further, oil prices continue to be volatile. Advanced drilling and completion technologies, such as horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing, have
resulted in increased investment by oil and gas producers in developing U.S. shale gas and, more recently, tight oil projects. The results of higher
investment in the exploration for and production of oil and gas and other factors, such as global economic and financial conditions discussed below,
may cause the price of oil to fall. Lower oil prices may not only cause our revenues to decrease but also may reduce the amount of oil that we can
produce economically. Continue depressed oil prices have resulted is us having to impair our estimated proved reserves and has had a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, if oil prices significantly decline for an extended period of time,
we may, among other things, be unable to have any borrowing capacity, repay future debt or obtain additional capital on attractive terms, all of which
can affect the value of our common stock.


                                                                            8

Future economic conditions in the U.S. and international markets could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and
results of operations.

The U.S. and other world economies continue to experience the after-effects of a global recession and credit market crisis. More volatility may occur
before a sustainable growth rate is achieved either domestically or globally. Even if such growth rate is achieved, such a rate may be lower than the
U.S. and international economies have experienced in the past. Global economic growth drives demand for energy from all sources, including fossil
fuels. A lower, future economic growth rate will result in decreased demand for our oil production and lower commodity prices, and consequently
reduce our revenues, cash flows from operations and our profitability.

We are subject to complex governmental laws and regulations that may adversely affect the cost, manner and feasibility of doing business.

Our oil drilling, production and gathering operations are subject to complex and stringent laws and regulations. To operate in compliance with these
laws and regulations, we must obtain and maintain numerous permits and approvals from various federal, state and local governmental authorities.
We may incur substantial costs to comply with these existing laws and regulations. In addition, our costs of compliance may increase if existing laws
and regulations are revised or reinterpreted, or if new laws and regulations apply to our operations. Such costs could have a material adverse effect on
our business, financial condition and results of operations. Failure to comply with laws and regulations applicable to our operations, including any
evolving interpretation and enforcement by government authorities, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and
results of operations.

Environmental laws and regulations may expose us to significant costs and liabilities.

There is inherent risk of incurring significant environmental costs and liabilities in our oil operations due to the handling of petroleum hydrocarbons
and generated wastes, the occurrence of air emissions and water discharges from work-related activities and the legacy of pollution from historical
industry operations and waste disposal practices. We may incur joint and several or strict liability under these environmental laws and regulations in
connection with spills, leaks or releases of petroleum hydrocarbons and wastes on, under or from our properties and facilities, some of which have
been used for exploration, production or development activities for many years and by third parties not under our control. In particular, the number of
private, civil lawsuits involving hydraulic fracturing has risen in recent years. Since late 2009, multiple private lawsuits alleging ground water
contamination have been filed in the U.S. against oil and gas companies, primarily by landowners who leased oil and gas rights to defendants, or by
landowners who live close to areas where hydraulic fracturing has taken place. In addition, changes in environmental laws and regulations occur
frequently, and any such changes that result in more stringent and costly waste handling, storage, transport, disposal or remediation requirements
could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may not be able to recover some or any of
these costs from insurance.

Our business requires significant capital expenditures and we may not be able to obtain needed capital or financing on satisfactory terms or at
all.

Our exploration, development and acquisition activities require substantial capital expenditures. We intend to fund our capital expenditures through a
combination of private or public equity financings. We may not be able to obtain equity financing on favorable terms or at all. The failure to obtain
financing could cause us to scale back our exploration and development operations, which in turn could lead to loss of properties.
                                                                           9

Table of Contents

Currently, all of our properties are located in eleven (11) counties, making us vulnerable to risks associated with having our production
concentrated in a small area.

All of our properties are concentrated in fourteen (14) counties comprised of seven (7) counties in Texas (Atascosa, Frio, Hemphill, Madison, Shelby,
Callahan and Roberts Counties), four (4) counties in Oklahoma (Ellis, Payne, Cleveland, and Harper Counties), one (1) county in Utah (Emergy
County), and two (2) counties in Ohio (Monroe and Washington Counties). As a result of this concentration, we are disproportionately exposed to the
natural decline of production from these fields as well as the impact of delays or interruptions of production from these wells, which could be caused
by significant governmental regulation, transportation capacity constraints, curtailments of production, service delays, natural disasters or other
events that impact this area.

Market conditions or transportation and infrastructure impediments may hinder our access to oil markets or delay our production or sales.

Market conditions or the unavailability of satisfactory oil processing and transportation services and infrastructure may hinder our access to oil
markets or delay our production or sales. The availability of a ready market for our oil production depends on a number of factors, including market
demand and the proximity of any producing wells that we may operate in the future to pipelines or trucking and rail terminal facilities. In addition,
the amount of oil that can be produced and sold is subject to curtailment in certain circumstances, such as pipeline interruptions due to maintenance,
physical damage to the gathering or transportation system or lack of contracted capacity on such systems. The curtailments arising from these and
similar circumstances may last from a few days to several months, and in many cases, we are provided with limited, if any, notice as to when these
circumstances will arise and their duration. As a result, we may not be able to sell, or may have to transport by more expensive means, the oil that we
produce, or we may be required to shut in oil wells or delay initial production until the necessary gathering and transportation systems are available.
Any significant curtailment in gathering system, transportation, pipeline capacity or significant delay in construction of necessary gathering and
transportation facilities, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

The unavailability or high cost of drilling rigs, equipment, materials, personnel and oilfield services could adversely affect our ability to execute
our drilling and development plans on a timely basis and within our budget.

Our industry is cyclical and, from time to time, there is a shortage of drilling rigs, equipment, supplies or qualified personnel. During these periods,
the costs and delivery times of equipment, oilfield services and supplies are substantially greater. In addition, the demand for, and wage rates of,
qualified drilling and completion crews rise as the number of active rigs in service increases. Increasing levels of exploration and production will
increase the demand for oilfield services, and the costs of these services may increase, while the quality of these services may suffer. If the
availability of equipment, crews, materials and services in counties in which our properties are located is particularly severe, our business, results of
operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected because our properties are located solely in those counties.

Competition in the oil and gas industry is intense, and most of our competitors have resources that are greater than ours.

We operate in a highly competitive environment for acquiring prospects and productive properties, marketing oil and securing equipment and skilled
personnel. Most of our competitors are major and large independent oil and gas companies that have financial, technical and personnel resources
substantially greater than ours. Those companies may be able to develop and acquire more prospects and productive properties than our financial or
personnel resources permit. Our ability to develop and operate our current projects, acquire additional prospects and discover reserves in the future
will depend on our ability to hire and retain qualified personnel, evaluate and select suitable properties and consummate transactions and in a highly
competitive environment. Also, there is substantial competition for capital available for investment in the oil and gas industry. Larger competitors
may be better able to withstand sustained periods of unsuccessful drilling and absorb the burden of changes in laws and regulations more easily than
we can, which would adversely affect our competitive position. We may not be able to compete successfully in the future in attracting and retaining
qualified personnel, acquiring prospective reserves, developing reserves, marketing oil and raising additional capital.


                                                                           10

Operating hazards or other interruptions of our operations could result in potential liabilities, for which we do not have insurance.

The oil and gas business involves certain operating hazards such as well blowouts, cratering, explosions, uncontrollable flows of gas, oil or well
fluids, fires, surface and subsurface pollution and contamination, and releases of toxic gas. The occurrence of one of the above may result in injury,
loss of life, suspension of operations, environmental damage and remediation and/or governmental investigations and penalties. We do not currently
have insurance and if we do acquire insurance at the commencement of operations, then consistent with insurance coverage generally available to the
industry, we expect that our insurance policies will provide limited coverage for losses or liabilities relating to pollution, with broader coverage for
sudden and accidental occurrences. Our insurance, when acquired, might be inadequate to cover our liabilities. The insurance market in general and
the energy insurance market in particular have been difficult markets over the past several years. Insurance costs are expected to continue to increase
over the next few years, and we may decrease coverage and retain more risk to mitigate future cost increases. If we incur substantial liability and the
damages are not covered by insurance or are in excess of policy limits, or if we incur liability at a time when we are not able to obtain liability
insurance, then our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.

Our results are subject to quarterly and seasonal fluctuations.

Our quarterly operating results may fluctuate and could be negatively impacted in the future as a result of a number of factors, including seasonal
variations in oil prices, variations in levels of production, if an when production commences, and the completion of development projects.

Risks Relating to an Investment in our Securities

If we fail to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting, the price of our common stock may be adversely affected.

We are required to establish and maintain appropriate internal controls over financial reporting. Failure to establish those controls, or any failure of
those controls once established, could adversely impact our public disclosures regarding our business, financial condition or results of operations.
Any failure of these controls could also prevent us from maintaining accurate accounting records and discovering accounting errors and financial
frauds. Rules adopted by the SEC pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 require annual assessment of our internal control over
financial reporting. The standards that must be met for management to assess the internal control over financial reporting as effective are complex,
and require significant documentation, testing and possible remediation to meet the detailed standards. We may encounter problems or delays in
completing activities necessary to make an assessment of our internal control over financial reporting. If we cannot assess our internal control over
financial reporting as effective, investor confidence and share value may be negatively impacted.

In addition, management’s assessment of internal controls over financial reporting may identify weaknesses and conditions that need to be addressed
in our internal controls over financial reporting or other matters that may raise concerns for investors. Any actual or perceived weaknesses and
conditions that need to be addressed in our internal control over financial reporting, disclosure of management’s assessment of our internal controls
over financial reporting, or disclosure of our public accounting firm’s attestation to or report on management’s assessment of our internal controls
over financial reporting may have an adverse impact on the price of our common stock.

Compliance with changing regulation of corporate governance and public disclosure will result in additional expenses.

Changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and
related SEC regulations, have created uncertainty for public companies and significantly increased the costs and risks associated with accessing the
public markets and public reporting. For example, on January 30, 2009, the SEC adopted rules requiring companies to provide their financial
statements in interactive data format using the eXtensible Business Reporting Language, or XBRL. We currently have to comply with these rules.
Our management team will need to invest significant management time and financial resources to comply with both existing and evolving standards
for public companies, which will lead to increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from
revenue generating activities to compliance activities.


                                                                           11

Because of the early stage of development and the nature of our business, our securities are considered highly speculative.

Our securities must be considered highly speculative, generally because of the nature of our business and the early stage of its development. We have
not generated any revenues nor have we realized a profit from our -operations to date and there is little likelihood that we will generate any revenues
or realize any profits in the short term. Any profitability in the future from our business will be dependent upon our ability to market the products
developed under our licensing agreement and to source other acquisitions in the industry we have chosen either additional technologies or exploration
projects. Since we have not generated any revenues, we will have to raise additional monies through the sale of our equity securities or debt in order
to continue our business operations.

We may, in the future, issue additional common shares that would reduce investors’ percent of ownership and may dilute our share value.

The future issuance of common shares may result in substantial dilution in the percentage of our common shares held by our then existing
stockholders. We may value any common shares issued in the future on an arbitrary basis. The issuance of common shares for future services or
acquisitions or other corporate actions may have the effect of diluting the value of the common shares held by our investors, and might have an
adverse effect on any trading market for our common shares.

Broker-dealers may be discouraged from effecting transactions in our shares because they are considered penny stocks and are subject to the
penny stock rules thereby potentially limiting the liquidity of our shares.

Rules 15g-1 through 15g-9 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, impose sales practice and disclosure requirements
on NASD broker-dealers who make a market in “penny stocks”. A penny stock generally includes any non-NASDAQ equity security that has a
market price of less than $5.00 per share. Our shares are quoted on the OTC Pink Marketplace. NASD broker-dealers who act as market makers for
our shares generally facilitate purchases and sales of our shares. The additional sales practice and disclosure requirements imposed upon broker-
dealers may discourage broker-dealers from effecting transactions in our shares, which could severely limit the market liquidity of the shares and
impede the sale of our shares in the secondary market.

Under the penny stock regulations, a broker-dealer selling penny stock to anyone other than an established customer or “accredited investor”
(generally, an individual with net worth in excess of $1,000,000 or an annual income exceeding $200,000, or $300,000 together with his or her
spouse) must make a special suitability determination for the purchaser and must receive the purchaser’s written consent to the transaction prior to
sale, unless the broker-dealer or the transaction is otherwise exempt.

In addition, the penny stock regulations require the broker-dealer to deliver, prior to any transaction involving a penny stock, a disclosure schedule
prepared by the SEC relating to the penny stock market, unless the broker-dealer or the transaction is otherwise exempt. A broker-dealer is also
required to disclose commissions payable to the broker-dealer and the registered representative and current quotations for the securities. Finally, a
broker-dealer is required to send monthly statements disclosing recent price information with respect to the penny stock held in a customer’s account
and information with respect to the limited market in penny stocks.

Our common stock may experience extreme rises or declines in price, and you may not be able to sell your shares at or above the price paid.

Our common stock may be highly volatile and could be subject to extreme fluctuations in response to various factors, many of which are beyond our
control, including (but not necessarily limited to): (i) the trading volume of our shares; (ii) the number of securities analysts, market-makers and
brokers following our common stock; (iii) changes in, or failure to achieve, financial estimates by securities analysts; (iv) actual or anticipated
variations in quarterly operating results; (v) conditions or trends in our business industries; (vi) announcements by us of significant contracts,
acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments; (vii) additions or departures of key personnel; (viii) sales of our common
stock; and (ix) general stock market price and volume fluctuations of publicly-trading and particularly, microcap companies.

Investors may have difficulty reselling shares of our common stock, either at or above the price they paid for our stock, or even at fair market value.
The stock markets often experience significant price and volume changes that are not related to the operating performance of individual companies,
and because our common stock is thinly traded it is particularly susceptible to such changes. These broad market changes may cause the market price
of our common stock to decline regardless of how well we perform as a company. In addition, there is a history of securities class action litigation
following periods of volatility in the market price of a company’s securities. Although there is no such shareholder litigation currently pending or
threatened against the Company, such a suit against us could result in the incursion of substantial legal fees, potential liabilities and the diversion of
management’s attention and resources from our business. Moreover, and as noted below, our shares are currently traded on the OTC Pink
Marketplace and, further, are subject to the penny stock regulations. Price fluctuations in such shares are particularly volatile and subject to
manipulation by market-makers, short-sellers and option traders.

A decline in the price of our common stock could affect our ability to raise further working capital, it may adversely impact our ability to continue
operations and we may go out of business.

A prolonged decline in the price of our common stock could result in a reduction in the liquidity of our common stock and a reduction in our ability
to raise capital. Because we may attempt to acquire a significant portion of the funds we need in order to conduct our planned operations through the
sale of equity securities, or convertible debt instruments, a decline in the price of our common stock could be detrimental to our liquidity and our
operations because the decline may cause investors to not choose to invest in our stock. If we are unable to raise the funds we require for all our
planned operations, we may be forced to reallocate funds from other planned uses and may suffer a significant negative effect on our business plan
and operations, including our ability to develop new products and continue our current operations. As a result, our business may suffer, and not be
successful and we may go out of business. We also might not be able to meet our financial obligations if we cannot raise enough funds through the
sale of our common stock and we may be forced to go out of business.

ITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES
OF EQUITY SECURITIES

Market Information

There is a limited public market for our common shares. Our common shares are listed for quotation on the Pink sheets of the OTC Markets under the
trading symbol “PTCO”. Trading in stocks quoted on the Pink Sheets is often thin and is characterized by wide fluctuations in trading prices due to
many factors that may be unrelated to a company’s operations or business prospects.

Pink Sheet securities are not listed or traded on the floor of an organized national or regional stock exchange. Instead, OTC Pink Sheet securities
transactions are conducted through a telephone and computer network connecting dealers in stocks. Pink Sheet issuers are traditionally smaller
companies that do not meet the financial and other listing requirements of a regional or national stock exchange.

Holders

As of June 23, 2022, we had 8 shareholders of record of our common stock with 21,048,440 shares of common stock outstanding.

Dividends

We have not paid any cash dividends to our shareholders. The declaration of any future cash dividends is at the discretion of our board of directors
and depends upon our earnings, if any, our capital requirements and financial position, our general economic conditions, and other pertinent
conditions. It is our present intention not to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future, but rather to reinvest earnings, if any, in our business
operations.

Equity Compensation Plans

Our company has not adopted any equity compensation plans and does not anticipate adopting any equity compensation plans in the near future.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, because the company has limited cash resources at this time, it may issue shares or options to or enter into obligations
that are convertible into shares of common stock with its employees and consultants as payment for services or as discretionary bonuses.

This annual report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These include statements
about our expectations, beliefs, intentions or strategies for the future, which we indicate by words or phrases such as “anticipate,” “expect,”
“intend,” “plan,” “will,” “we believe,” “management believes” and similar language. Except for the historical information contained herein, the
matters discussed in this “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” and elsewhere in this current
report on Form 10-K are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. The factors listed in the section captioned “Risk Factors,”
as well as any cautionary language in this current report on Form 10-K, provide examples of risks, uncertainties and events that may cause our
actual results to differ materially from those projected. Except as may be required by law, we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking
statement to reflect events after the date of this current report on Form 10-K.

Overview

We intend for this discussion to provide information that will assist in understanding our financial statements, the changes in certain key items in
those financial statements, and the primary factors that accounted for those changes, as well as how certain accounting principles affect our financial
statements.

Our company has experienced net losses to date, and it has not generated revenue from operations, we will need additional working capital to service
debt and for ongoing operations, which raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Management of our company has
developed a strategy to meet operational shortfalls which may include equity funding, short term or long term financing or debt financing, to enable
our company to reach profitable operations. If we fail to generate positive cash flow or obtain additional financing, when required, we may have to
modify, delay, or abandon some or all of our business and expansion plans

We did not recognize any revenue during the year ended March 31, 2022 and 2021.

Our net loss for the year ended March 31, 2022 increased to $140,091,315 from $116,541 for the year ended March 31, 2021 due to the increase in
operating expenses. During the year ended March 31, 2022, our company incurred stock based compensation of $140,000,000 for issuance of
common shares to our Director for management services.

Plan of Operation

Management is considering plans to reactive its inactive wells through a rework program on the Leases. Additional rights may be leased out from
mineral owner to deeper zones near 5,000 feet and below. However, such plans are subject to raising financing of $500,000 to pay for such rework
plans and an analysis of potential income based on projected oil prices in the future.
Our company is actively seeking to acquire producing and non-producing leases that will allow us to explore and drill in high-profile pay zones.

We intend to raise capital at a low cost from private placements so that we may acquire numerous additional leases, and to commence drilling, and
taking advantage of the inevitable uptick in oil prices to come.

In the current climate, our company believes that there are a very large number of oil & gas leases under distress due to the depressed gas prices and
that we can strategically position our company to acquire as many of these leases as possible at a discount to market value, hence creating
shareholder value.

On the Burns and Rogers Leases, we intend to rework all current wells and bring them back to production once oil prices are in a suitable range. We
are planning an exploration strategy to drill new wells on the current Leases, as well as acquire deeper rights in order to drill some of the wells at
great depths. We expect that reservoirs at those depths could yield a very high daily output of oil.

To the shareholders and the board of directors of PetroGas Company

Opinion on the Financial Statements

We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of PetroGas Company (the "Company") as of March 31, 2022 and 2021, the related statements of
operations, stockholders' equity (deficit), and cash flows for the years then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "financial
statements"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of March 31,
2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States.

Substantial Doubt about the Company’s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern

The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2 to
the financial statements, the Company’s minimal activities raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. The financial
statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

Basis for Opinion

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's
financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
States) ("PCAOB") and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the
applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not
required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to
obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
Our audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and
performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our
opinion.

                                                     NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                                                             MARCH 31, 2021

NOTE 1 – DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND BASIS OF PERSENTATION

Organization and nature of business

PetroGas Company (Formerly America Resources Exploration Inc. (the “Company”)), was incorporated in the State of Nevada on January 24, 2014.
The Company was incorporated under the name Alazzio Entertainment Corp. and changed its name to America Resources Exploration Inc. on April
17, 2015. Subsequently, on January 20, 2016, the Company changed its name to PetroGas Company. On June 12, 2015, the Company completed an
acquisition of working interests in certain oil & gas properties. All share amounts in these financial statements have been adjusted to reflect this stock
split.

NOTE 2 – GOING CONCERN

The Company had no significant revenues from the inception through March 31, 2022. As of March 31, 2022, the Company has an accumulated
deficit of $142,099,010. We will need additional working capital to service debt and for ongoing operations, which raises substantial doubt about its
ability to continue as a going concern. Management of the Company has developed a strategy to meet operational shortfalls which may include equity
funding, short term or long term financing or debt financing, to enable the Company to reach profitable operations.

The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern.
If we fail to generate positive cash flow or obtain additional financing, when required, we may have to modify, delay, or abandon some or all of our
business and expansion plans.

NOTE 3 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis of Presentation

The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”).
Because a precise determination of many assets and liabilities is dependent upon future events, the preparation of financial statements for a period
necessarily involves the use of estimates, which have been made using careful judgment. Actual results may vary from these estimates.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to
make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the
date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
estimates. These estimates are reviewed periodically, and, as adjustments become necessary, they are reported in earnings in the period in which they
become known. The estimates on depreciation were based on the estimated useful lives of the Company’s assets. Any estimates during the period
have had an immaterial effect on earnings.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents consist of commercial accounts and interest-bearing bank deposits and are carried at cost, which approximates current
value. Items are considered to be cash equivalents if the original maturity is three months or less.


                                                                            F-7

Oil and Gas Properties – Full Cost Method

The Company follows the full cost accounting method to account for oil and natural gas properties, whereby costs incurred in the acquisition,
exploration and development of oil and gas reserves are capitalized. Such costs include lease acquisition, geological and geophysical activities,
rentals on nonproducing leases, drilling, completing and equipping of oil and gas wells and administrative costs directly attributable to those
activities and asset retirement costs. Disposition of oil and gas properties are accounted for as a reduction of capitalized costs, with no gain or loss
recognized unless such adjustment would significantly alter the relationship between capital costs and proved reserves of oil and gas, in which case
the gain or loss is recognized to operations.

The capitalized costs of oil and gas properties, excluding unevaluated and unproved properties, are amortized as depreciation, depletion and
amortization expense using the units-of-production method based on estimated proved recoverable oil and gas reserves.

The costs associated with unevaluated and unproved properties, initially excluded from the amortization base, relate to unproved leasehold acreage,
wells and production facilities in progress and wells pending determination of the existence of proved reserves, together with capitalized interest
costs for these projects. Unproved leasehold costs are transferred to the amortization base with the costs of drilling the related well once a
determination of the existence of proved reserves has been made or upon impairment of a lease. Costs associated with wells in progress and
completed wells that have yet to be evaluated are transferred to the amortization base once a determination is made whether or not proved reserves
can be assigned to the property. Costs of dry wells are transferred to the amortization base immediately upon determination that the well is
unsuccessful.

All items classified as unproved property are assessed on a quarterly basis for possible impairment or reduction in value. Properties are assessed on
an individual basis or as a group if properties are individually insignificant. The assessment includes consideration of various factors, including, but
not limited to, the following: intent to drill; remaining lease term; geological and geophysical evaluations; drilling results and activity; assignment of
proved reserves; and economic viability of development if proved reserves are assigned. During any period in which these factors indicate an
impairment, the cumulative drilling costs incurred to date for such property and all or a portion of the associated leasehold costs are transferred to the
full cost pool and become subject to amortization.

Under full cost accounting rules for each cost center, capitalized costs of evaluated oil and gas properties, including asset retirement costs, less
accumulated amortization and related deferred income taxes, may not exceed an amount (the “cost ceiling”) equal to the sum of (a) the present value
of future net cash flows from estimated production of proved oil and gas reserves, based on current prices and operating conditions, discounted at ten
percent (10%), plus (b) the cost of properties not being amortized, plus (c) the lower of cost or estimated fair value of any unproved properties
included in the costs being amortized, less (d) any income tax effects related to differences between the book and tax basis of the properties involved.
If capitalized costs exceed this limit, the excess is charged to operations. For purposes of the ceiling test calculation, current prices are defined as the
unweighted arithmetic average of the first day of the month price for each month within the 12-month period prior to the end of the reporting period.
Prices are adjusted for basis or location differentials. Unless sales contracts specify otherwise, prices are held constant for the productive life of each
well. Similarly, current costs are assumed to remain constant over the entire calculation period.

Revenue Recognition

Oil and gas sales result from undivided interests held by the Company in oil and gas properties and royalty revenues. Sales of oil and gas produced
from oil and gas operations are recognized when the product is delivered to the purchaser and title transfers to the purchaser. Charges for gathering
and transportation are included in production expenses.

Revenue from royalties is recognized as they are earned, when collection is reasonably assured. Royalty revenue is recorded in the same period as the
sales that generate the royalty payment.

Asset Retirement Obligations

The Company records a liability for asset retirement obligations (“ARO”) associated with its oil and gas wells when those assets are placed in
service. The corresponding cost is capitalized as an asset and included in the carrying amount of oil and gas properties and is depleted over the useful
life of the properties. Subsequently, the ARO liability is accreted to its then-present value.


                                                                           F-8

Table of Contents

Inherent in the fair value calculation of an ARO are numerous assumptions and judgments including the ultimate settlement amounts, inflation
factors, credit adjusted discount rates, timing of settlement, and changes in the legal, regulatory, environmental and political environments. To the
extent future revisions to these assumptions impact the fair value of the existing ARO liability, a corresponding adjustment is made to the oil and gas
property balance. Settlements greater than or less than amounts accrued as ARO are recorded as a gain or loss upon settlement.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

The Company measures its financial assets and liabilities in accordance with the requirements of ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and
Disclosures. ASC 820 clarifies the definition of fair value, prescribes methods for measuring fair value, and establishes a fair value hierarchy to
classify the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows:

Level 1 - Inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities available at the measurement date.

Level 2 - Inputs are unadjusted quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets and
liabilities in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable, and inputs derived from or corroborated by observable
market data.

Level 3 - Inputs are unobservable inputs which reflect the reporting entity’s own assumptions on what assumptions the market participants would use
in pricing the asset or liability based on the best available information,

The carrying value of all assets and liabilities approximated their fair values as March 31, 2022 and March 31, 2021, respectively.

Stock-Based Compensation

The Company follows the guidance included in ASC 718 Compensation-Stock Compensation (“ASC 718”) using the modified prospective transition
method. The Company recognizes compensation expense in the financial statements for share-based awards based on the grant date fair value of
those awards. For the year ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company incurred stock based compensation of $105,000,000 and $0 recorded under
salaries and wages, respectively.

Income Taxes

The Company accounts for income taxes pursuant to ASC 740, Income Taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for differences between
the financial statements and tax basis of the assets and liabilities that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future based on enacted tax
laws and rates. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. Income tax
expense is recorded for the amount of income tax payable or refundable for the period increased or decreased by the change in deferred tax assets and
liabilities during the period.

Earnings or Loss Per Share

In accordance with ASC Topic 280 – “Earnings Per Share”, the basic loss per common share is computed by dividing net loss available to common
stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted loss per common share is computed similar to basic loss per
common share except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the
potential common shares had been issued and if the additional common shares were dilutive.

For the years ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, net loss per shares as the result of the computation was anti-dilutive:

                                                                                                                         March 31,        March 31,

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In December 2019, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standard Update No. 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740):
Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes (ASU 2019-12), which simplifies the accounting for income taxes. This guidance will be effective for
entities for the fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2020 on a prospective basis, with early
adoption permitted. For the Company, the new standard was effective on January 1, 2021 and we do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have
a material impact on our financial statements.

Management has considered all other recent accounting pronouncements issued. The Company’s management believes that these recent
pronouncements will not have a material effect on the Company’s financial statements.

NOTE 4 – ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS

The Company has asset retirement obligations for any wells that are permanently removed from service. The primary obligations involve the removal
and disposal of surface equipment, plugging and abandoning the wells and site restoration. For the purpose of determining the fair value of ARO
incurred during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016, the Company used the following assumptions.

           Inflation Rate                                                                                                                 3%
           Estimated asset life                                                                                                    20 years
           Credit adjusted risk free interest rate                                                                                      18%

As at March 31, 2016, the Company determined to fully impair its shut in wells given a lack of production over a period in excess of two years, and
the uncertainty in returning the wells to production in the future. As a result, the Company has recorded a long term liability equal to the full value of
the ARO.

As at March 31, 2022 and 2021, a total of $83,580 is recorded as asset retirement obligations, respectively

NOTE 5 – PROMISSORY NOTE – RELATED PARTY

On December 31, 2016, the Company entered into a promissory note with a majority shareholder, Rise Fast Limited, for an amount of $240,683. The
promissory note bears interest at a rate of 2% per annum, and is payable on December 31, 2019.

The Company provides for income taxes under ASC 740, “Income Taxes.” Under the asset and liability method of ASC 740, deferred tax assets and
liabilities are recorded based on the differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities and the tax rates in effect when
these differences are expected to reverse. A valuation allowance is provided for certain deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that the
Company will not realize tax assets through future operations.

The components of the Company’s deferred tax asset and reconciliation of income taxes computed at the statutory rate to the income tax amount
recorded as of March 31, 2022 and 2021, are as follows:

NOTE 11 – RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES

In early 2020, the World Health Organization declared the rapidly spreading coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak a pandemic. This pandemic
has resulted in governments worldwide enacting emergency measures to combat the spread of the virus. The Company considered the impact of
COVID-19 on the assumptions and estimates used and determined that there were no material adverse impacts on the Company’s results of
operations and financial position at March 31, 2022. The full extent of the future impacts of COVID-19 on the Company’s operations is uncertain. A
prolonged outbreak could have a material adverse impact on financial results and business operations of the Company in the future. The Company
is not aware of any specific event or circumstance that would require an update to its estimates or judgments or a revision of the carrying value of its
assets or liabilities as of the date of issuance of these financial statements. These estimates may change, as new events occur and additional
information is obtained.

ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE

Not Applicable.

ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended)
that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the Company’s Securities Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to
the Company’s management, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Our company’s management, with the participation of our principal executive and principal financial officer evaluated the effectiveness of our
company’s disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon that evaluation, our principal executive
and principal financial officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, our company’s disclosure controls and procedures
were not effective.

Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and
15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Management has employed a framework consistent with Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(c), to evaluate internal
control over financial reporting described below. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Management, including our principal executive officer Mr. Huang Yu who is also our principal financial officer, conducted an evaluation of the
design and operation of our internal control over financial reporting as of and for the year ended March 31, 2022. In making this assessment,
management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission 2013 Internal Control-Integrated
Framework (“COSO”). As a result of this assessment, Mr. Huang Yu concluded that, as of and for the year ended March 31, 2022, our internal
control over financial reporting was not effective in providing reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation
of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles as of the year ended March 31, 2022.

The matters involving internal controls and procedures that our company’s management considered to be material weaknesses under COSO and SEC
rules were: (1) lack of a majority of independent directors on the Company’s board of directors, resulting in ineffective oversight in the establishment
and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures; (2) limited number of staff, not allowing for complete segregation of incompatible
duties; and (3) insufficient written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting with respect to the requirements and application of
GAAP and SEC disclosure requirements. The aforementioned material weaknesses were identified by the Company’s management in connection
with the preparation of our financial statements as of March 31, 2022.

Management believes that the appointment of one or more independent directors, will remedy the lack of a majority of outside directors on our
company’s Board. In addition, management believes that preparing and implementing sufficient written policies and checklists will remedy the
insufficient written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting with respect to the requirements and application of IFRS and SEC
disclosure requirements. Further, management believes that the hiring of additional personnel who have the technical expertise and knowledge will
result in proper segregation of duties.

Any effort to increase the size of the Board of Directors, appoint independent directors or personnel is conditional upon our company raising
additional capital.

We will continue to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of our internal controls and procedures and our internal controls over financial reporting
on an ongoing basis and are committed to taking further action and implementing additional enhancements or improvements, as necessary and as
funds allow.
This annual report does not include an attestation report of the company’s registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial
reporting. Management’s report was not subject to attestation by our company’s registered public accounting firm pursuant to temporary rules of the
Securities and Exchange Commission that permit the company to provide only management’s report in this annual report.

During the Company’s last fiscal quarter there were no changes in internal control over financial reporting that materially affected, or are reasonably
likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 _______________
(1) A beneficial owner of a security includes any person who, directly or indirectly, through any contract, arrangement, understanding, relationship,
      or otherwise has or shares: (i) voting power, which includes the power to vote, or to direct the voting of shares; and (ii) investment power,
      which includes the power to dispose or direct the disposition of shares. Certain shares may be deemed to be beneficially owned by more than
      one person (if, for example, persons share the power to vote or the power to dispose of the shares). In addition, shares are deemed to be
      beneficially owned by a person if the person has the right to acquire the shares (for example, upon exercise of an option) within 60 days of the
      date as of which the information is provided. In computing the percentage ownership of any person, the amount of shares outstanding is
      deemed to include the amount of shares beneficially owned by such person (and only such person) by reason of these acquisition rights. As a
      result, the percentage of outstanding shares of any person as shown in this table does not necessarily reflect the person’s actual ownership or
      voting power with respect to the number of shares of common stock actually outstanding on June 23, 2022. As of June 23, 2022, there were
      21,048,440 shares of our common stock issued and outstanding.

Our company has not adopted any equity compensation plans and does not anticipate adopting any equity compensation plans in the near future.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, because the company has limited cash resources at this time, it may issue shares or options to or enter into obligations
that are convertible into shares of common stock with its employees and consultants as payment for services or as discretionary bonuses. The
company does not have any arrangements for such issuances or arrangements at this time.

ITEM 13. CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS, AND DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE

Other than as described below, our company has not engaged in any transactions with any of its related persons.

During the year ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, the Director of the Company made advancement of $32,533 and $6,500 for operation expenses on
behalf of the Company, respectively. The loan is non-interest bearing and due on demand.

Greater Prudhoe Area
The Greater Prudhoe Area includes the Prudhoe Bay Unit, which consists of the Prudhoe Bay Field and five satellite fields, as well as
the Greater Point McIntyre Area fields. Prudhoe Bay, the largest conventional oil field in North America, is the site of a large waterflood
and enhanced oil recovery operation, supported by a large gas and water processing operation. Prudhoe Bay’s western satellite fields
are Aurora, Borealis, Polaris, Midnight Sun and Orion, while the Point McIntyre, Niakuk, Raven, Lisburne and North Prudhoe Bay State
fields are part of the Greater Point McIntyre Area. Field installations include seven production facilities, two gas plants, two seawater
plants and a central power station. Activity in 2022 consisted of rotary and coil tubing drilling throughout the year.

Greater Kuparuk Area
We operate the Greater Kuparuk Area, which includes the Kuparuk River Unit, consisting of the Kuparuk Field and four satellite fields:
Tarn, Tabasco, Meltwater and West Sak. Kuparuk is located 40 miles west of the Prudhoe Bay Field. Field installations include three
central production facilities which separate oil, natural gas and water as well as a seawater treatment plant. Development drilling at
Kuparuk consists of rotary-drilled wells and horizontal multi-laterals from existing wellbores utilizing coiled-tubing drilling.

Western North Slope
On the Western North Slope, we operate the Colville River Unit and the Greater Mooses Tooth Unit.

The Colville River Unit includes the Alpine Field and three satellite fields: Nanuq, Fiord and Qannik, which are located approximately 34
miles west of the Kuparuk Field. Field installations include one central production facility which separates oil, natural gas and water. In
May 2022, Fiord West Kuparuk achieved first production.

The Greater Mooses Tooth Unit is the first unit established entirely within the National Petroleum Reserve Alaska (NPR-A). In 2017, we
began construction in the unit with two phases: Greater Mooses Tooth #1 (GMT1) and Greater Mooses Tooth #2 (GMT2). GMT1
achieved first oil in 2018 and completed drilling in 2019. First oil for GMT2 was achieved in late 2021.

2022 activity on the Western North Slope consisted of rotary and extended reach drilling throughout the year.

Exploration
Appraisal activities of the Willow Discovery in the Bear Tooth Unit in the NPR-A concluded in 2020. A Final Supplemental
Environmental Impact Statement was released on February 1, 2023 and published in the Federal Register on February 3, 2023, with a
record of decision to follow no sooner than 30 days afterwards.

We continued evaluating the Narwhal trend throughout 2022, purchasing additional seismic data and drilling a second injector well to
allow a fully supported production test. We are planning future Narwhal development from the existing Alpine CD4 infrastructure to help
inform the design and optimization of the future CD8 pad.

We plan to drill the Bear-1 exploration well at a location 30 miles south of the Kuparuk River Unit and east of the Colville River on state
lands in early 2023. The well will test the Brookian topset play.

In late 2021, the Coyote Brookian topset exploration prospect in the Kuparuk River Unit was tested with a near vertical sidetrack from
an existing wellbore. The well was fracture stimulated and tested in early 2022. We are planning further appraisal drilling in 2023.

Transportation
We transport the petroleum liquids produced on the North Slope to Valdez, Alaska through an 800-mile pipeline that is part of Trans-
Alaska Pipeline System (TAPS). We have a 29.5 percent ownership interest in TAPS, and we also have ownership interests in and
operate the Alpine, Kuparuk and Oliktok pipelines on the North Slope.

Our wholly owned subsidiary, Polar Tankers, Inc., manages the marine transportation of our North Slope production, using five
company-owned, double-hulled tankers, and charters third-party vessels, as necessary. The tankers deliver oil from Valdez, Alaska,
primarily to refineries on the west coast of the U.S.

Surmont
Our bitumen resources in Canada are produced via an enhanced thermal oil recovery method called SAGD, whereby steam is injected
into the reservoir, effectively liquefying the heavy bitumen, which is recovered and pumped to the surface for further processing.
Operations include two central processing facilities for treatment and blending of bitumen. At December 31, 2022, we held
approximately 600,000 net acres of land in the Athabasca Region of northeastern Alberta.

The Surmont oil sands leases are located approximately 35 miles south of Fort McMurray, Alberta. Surmont is a 50/50 joint venture with
Total Energies SE that offers long-lived, sustained production. We are focused on keeping facilities full, structurally lowering costs,
reducing GHG intensity and optimizing asset performance.

In 2022, we began construction on the asset's next pad (Pad 267), which included the drilling of 24 well pairs. First production on Pad
267 is expected in early 2024.

In 2021, we began processing a portion of Surmont’s blended bitumen at the Diluent Recovery Unit constructed in Alberta, unlocking
additional value for the asset by providing additional market access to our heavy crude oil. In 2019, Surmont implemented the use of
condensate for bitumen blending through the central processing facility 2; enabling the asset to lower blend ratio and diluent supply
costs, gain protection from synthetic crude oil supply disruptions and gain optionality on sales products. The alternative blend project
was completed in 2021 at central processing facility 1. Full Surmont Heavy Dilbit (condensate bitumen blend) was first produced across
both facilities in the fourth quarter of 2021.

Montney
The Montney is an unconventional resource play located in northeastern British Columbia. At December 31, 2022, we held
approximately 300,000 acres of land with 100 percent working interest in the liquids-rich section of the Montney.

In 2022, development activity consisted of drilling 17 horizontal wells and bringing 12 wells online. In addition, we are progressing
development of additional pads along with construction on the second phase of our processing facility with start-up scheduled for the
third quarter of 2023.

Exploration
Our primary exploration focus is assessing our Montney acreage. In 2023, appraisal drilling and completions activity within the Montney
will continue to explore the area’s resource potential.

Australia Pacific LNG Pty Ltd. (APLNG), our joint venture with Origin Energy Limited and China Petrochemical Corporation (Sinopec), is
focused on producing CBM from the Bowen and Surat basins in Queensland, Australia, to supply the domestic gas market and convert
the CBM into LNG for export. Origin operates APLNG’s upstream production and pipeline system, and we operate the downstream
LNG facility, located on Curtis Island near Gladstone, Queensland, as well as the LNG export sales business.

We operate two fully subscribed 4.5 million metric tonnes per year LNG trains. Approximately 3,500 net wells are ultimately expected to
supply both the LNG sales contracts and domestic gas market. The wells are supported by gathering systems, central gas processing
and compression stations, water treatment facilities and an export pipeline connecting the gas fields to the LNG facilities. The LNG is
being sold to Sinopec under 20-year sales agreements for 7.6 million metric tonnes of LNG per year, and Japan-based Kansai Electric
Power Co., Inc. under a 20-year sales agreement for approximately 1 million metric tonnes of LNG per year.

In February 2022, we completed the acquisition of an additional 10 percent interest in APLNG from Origin Energy, increasing our
ownership to 47.5 percent, with Origin and Sinopec retaining 27.5 percent and 25 percent interests, respectively.

November 2021.

Exploration
In 2017, we were awarded operatorship and a 50 percent working interest in Block WL4-00, which included the existing Salam-1 oil
discovery and encompassed 0.6 million gross acres. In 2018 and 2019, we drilled exploration and appraisal wells, resulting in oil
discoveries under evaluation at Salam and Benum Fields. In 2022, we drilled two additional appraisal wells and one exploration well to
evaluate the oil discoveries. The Gagau-1 exploration well made a sub-commercial gas discovery and was expensed as a dry hole. The
information from the well results will help optimize future development plans.

In 2018, we were awarded a 50 percent working interest and operatorship of Block SK304 encompassing 2.1 million gross acres off the
coast of Sarawak, offshore Malaysia. We acquired 3D seismic over the acreage and completed processing of this data in 2019. The
Mersing-1 exploration well was drilled in 2022, did not encounter any significant hydrocarbons and was expensed as a dry hole. SK304
is a block that we are continuing to evaluate.

In 2021, we were awarded operatorship and an 85 percent working interest in Block SB405 encompassing 1.4 million gross acres off
the coast of Sabah, offshore Malaysia. A 3D seismic survey was acquired in 2022, and processing and evaluation of this data will be
ongoing through 2023.

Other International

The Other International segment includes interests in Colombia as well as contingencies associated with prior operations in other
countries.

Colombia
We have an 80 percent operated interest in the Middle Magdalena Basin Block VMM-3 extending over approximately 67,000 net acres.
In addition, we have an 80 percent working interest in the VMM-2 Block which extends over approximately 58,000 net acres and is
contiguous to the VMM-3 Block. The blocks are currently in Force Majeure due to the lack of a defined Environmental Licensing
process.

Other
Marketing Activities
Our Commercial organization manages our worldwide commodity portfolio, which mainly includes natural gas, crude oil, bitumen, NGLs
and LNG. Marketing activities are performed through offices in the U.S., Canada, Europe and Asia. In marketing our production, we
attempt to minimize flow disruptions, maximize realized prices and manage credit-risk exposure. Commodity sales are generally made
at prevailing market prices at the time of sale. We also purchase and sell third-party commodity volumes to better position the company
to satisfy customer demand while fully utilizing transportation and storage capacity.

Natural Gas
Our natural gas production, along with third-party purchased gas, is primarily marketed in the U.S., Canada and Europe. Our natural
gas is sold to a diverse client portfolio which includes local distribution companies; gas and power utilities; large industrials;
independent, integrated or state-owned oil and gas companies; as well as marketing companies. To reduce our market exposure and
credit risk, we also transport natural gas via firm and interruptible transportation agreements to major market hubs.

Crude Oil, Bitumen and Natural Gas Liquids
Our crude oil, bitumen and NGL revenues are derived from production in the U.S., Canada, Asia, Africa and Europe. These
commodities are primarily sold under contracts with prices based on market indices, adjusted for location, quality and transportation.

LNG
LNG marketing efforts are focused on equity LNG production facilities located in Australia and Qatar. LNG is primarily sold under long-
term contracts with prices based on market indices. In 2022, we entered into several agreements with Sempra entities in connection
with the Port Arthur LNG (PALNG) facility, including a 20-year sale and purchase agreement for 5 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) of
LNG offtake at the start-up of Phase 1 of the PALNG facility. In addition, we will acquire 30 percent of the equity in Phase 1 of PALNG.
Development of PALNG is subject to completing required commercial agreements and resolving a number of risks and uncertainties,
obtaining financing and reaching a final investment decision, among other factors. In addition, we secured regasification capacity at the
German LNG terminal in Brunsbuttel that will provide access to the German natural gas market.

Energy Partnerships
Marine Well Containment Company (MWCC)
We are a founding member of the MWCC, a non-profit organization formed in 2010, which provides well containment equipment and
technology in the deepwater U.S. Gulf of Mexico. MWCC’s containment system meets the U.S. Bureau of Safety and Environmental
Enforcement requirements for a subsea well containment system that can respond to a deepwater well control incident in the U.S. Gulf

Low-Carbon Technologies
In 2021, we established a multi-disciplinary Low-Carbon Technologies organization, with the remit to support our net-zero ambition,
understand the alternative energy landscape and prioritize opportunities for future competitive investment.

Throughout 2022, we continued our focus on implementing emissions reduction projects across our global portfolio, including
production efficiency measures and methane and flaring reductions. In September 2021, we strengthened our 2030 GHG emissions
intensity reduction target to 40-50 percent from a 2016 baseline and expanded the target to apply on both a gross operated and net
equity basis. To help achieve this goal, the Low-Carbon Technologies organization worked with the company's business units to begin
developing and implementing region-specific net-zero scenarios identifying potential technology solutions for hard-to-abate emissions,
and piloting new methods to reduce and accelerate Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions reduction. Potential projects evaluated included
CCS and electrification studies, zero/low emission equipment design enhancements, installations to continuously monitor and detect
methane emissions, and operational changes to reduce flaring and methane venting volumes.

Within the low-carbon opportunities landscape, the company has prioritized opportunities in CCS and hydrogen. In 2022, we evaluated
carbon dioxide storage sites along the U.S. Gulf Coast, progressed land acquisition efforts and business development work, initiated
permitting activities for a potential appraisal well for carbon sequestration and advanced engineering studies for multiple opportunities.
In Europe, we continued evaluation of a carbon capture solution to reduce emissions at the operated Teesside Oil Terminal with
engineering studies and a due diligence phase with the United Kingdom's Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy.

Delivery Commitments
We sell crude oil and natural gas from our producing operations under a variety of contractual arrangements, some of which specify the
delivery of a fixed and determinable quantity. Our commercial organization also enters into natural gas sales contracts where the
source of the natural gas used to fulfill the contract can be the spot market or a combination of our reserves and the spot market.
Worldwide, we are contractually committed to deliver approximately 578 billion cubic feet of natural gas, 345 million barrels of crude oil
and 12.9 million megawatt hours of electricity in the future. These contracts have various expiration dates through the year 2030. We
expect to fulfill these delivery commitments with third-party purchases, as supported by our gas management and power supply
agreements; proved developed reserves; and PUDs. See the disclosure on “Proved Undeveloped Reserves” in the “Supplementary
Data - Oil and Gas Operations” section following the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for information on the development of
PUDs.

Human Capital Management
Values, Principles and Governance
At ConocoPhillips, our human capital management (HCM) approach starts with a foundation in our core SPIRIT Values – Safety,
People, Integrity, Responsibility, Innovation, and Teamwork. These SPIRIT Values set the tone for how we interact with all of our
internal and external stakeholders. We believe a safe organization is a successful organization, and therefore, we prioritize personal
and process safety across the company. Our SPIRIT Values are a source of pride. Our day-to-day work is guided by the principles of
accountability and performance, which means the way we do our work is as important as the results we deliver. We believe these core
values and principles set us apart, align our workforce and provide a foundation for our culture.

Our Executive Leadership Team (ELT) and our Board of Directors play a key role in setting our HCM strategy and driving accountability
for meaningful progress. The ELT and Board of Directors engage often on workforce-related topics. Our HCM programs are overseen
and administered by our human resources function with support from business leaders across the company.

We depend on our workforce to successfully execute our company’s strategy and we recognize the importance of creating a workplace
where our people feel valued. Our HCM programs are built around three pillars that we believe are necessary for success: a compelling
culture, a world-class workforce and strong external engagement. Each of these pillars is described in more detail below.

A Compelling Culture
How we do our work is what sets us apart and drives our performance. We’re experts in what we do and continuously find ways to do
our jobs better. We value diversity and create an inclusive culture of belonging. Together, we deliver strong performance, but not at all
costs. We embrace our core cultural attributes that are shared by everyone, everywhere.

Health, Safety and Environment
Our HSE organization sets expectations and provides tools and assurance to our workforce to promote and achieve HSE excellence.
We manage and assure ConocoPhillips HSE policies, standards and practices, to help ensure business activities are consistently safe,
healthy and conducted in an environmentally and socially responsible manner across the globe. Each business unit manages its local
operational risks with particular attention to process safety, occupational safety and environmental and emergency preparedness risk.
Objectives, targets and deadlines are set and tracked annually to drive strong HSE performance. Progress is tracked and reported to
our ELT and the Board of Directors. HSE audits are conducted on business units and staff groups to ensure conformance with
ConocoPhillips HSE policies, standards and practices where improvement actions are identified and tracked to completion.

We continuously look for ways to operate more safely, efficiently and responsibly. We focus on reducing human error by emphasizing
interaction among people, equipment and work processes. By being curious about how work is done, recognizing error-likely situations
and applying safeguards, we can reduce the likelihood and severity of unexpected incidents. We conduct thorough investigations of all
serious incidents to understand the root cause and share lessons learned globally to improve our procedures, training, maintenance
programs and designs. As we integrate various assets through acquisitions, it is important that we drive this culture of continuous
learning and improvement, refine our existing HSE processes and tools and enhance our commitment to safe, efficient and responsible
operations.

COVID-19 Response
In 2022, the number of COVID-19 cases across the company was significantly less than the prior two years. With less risk to our
operations, the Crisis Management Support Team that had been in place since the beginning of the pandemic, was disbanded in
August; however, our Health Services organization continues to monitor the situation and support business units and functions as
needed to minimize any potential for business interruption.

Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
At ConocoPhillips, we believe our unique differences power the future of energy. Our DEI vision is to foster an inclusive culture that
values the rich mixture of backgrounds, identities and workstyles of our people, built on equitable practices that support all employees
in unlocking their full potential. Our commitment to DEI is foundational to our SPIRIT Values and to achieving our business objectives.
All employees play a part in creating and sustaining an inclusive work environment because everyone benefits from DEI.

The ELT has ultimate accountability for advancing our DEI commitments through a governance structure that includes a Chief Diversity
Officer (CDO), a dedicated DEI organization and a global DEI Council consisting of senior leaders from across the company. The
company sets goals and measures progress based on a transparent DEI strategy with four pillars that guide our focus and approach:
people, programs and processes, culture and our external brand and reputation. All company leaders are accountable for setting
personal DEI goals and advancing DEI through local efforts. Our DEI efforts and progress are regularly reviewed with the Board of
Directors.

In 2022, we welcomed our new CDO. Over the course of the year, the CDO established the DEI organization and embarked on a global
listening tour to understand the impact of current efforts, areas for improvement and the overall employee experience. Based on the
insights and perspectives from employees, the company’s DEI strategy was refreshed. Highlights from our 2022 DEI accomplishments
include:
     • Reviewing the results of the 2022 Perspectives survey and continuing to integrate the insights into our DEI efforts;
     • Staffing the newly established DEI organization;
     • Launching our DEI Dashboards 2.0 internally, which feature expanded global and U.S. workforce metrics and industry
         benchmark data; and
     • Hosting our inaugural Black Leadership Symposium to support future leadership diversity in the company.

We continue to actively monitor diversity metrics on a global basis. We are committed to being transparent as we build a more diverse,
equitable and inclusive workplace. Tables of 2022 employee demographics by gender and ethnicity, and by country, are shown below:

Recruitment
Our continued success requires a strong global workforce that can contribute the right skills, in the right places, to achieve our strategic
objectives. We offer university internships across multiple disciplines to attract the best early-career talent. We partner with top diversity
organizations and universities, including Hispanic-serving organizations and Historically Black Colleges and Universities. We also
recruit extensively for external experienced hires to supplement our university and internal pipeline. These individuals bring critical skills
and help us to maintain a broad range of expertise and experience. We have taken significant steps to embed inclusion into each step
of our recruiting practices, including adapting the way we construct job descriptions to using intentionally diverse interview panels. We
conduct routine talent assessments with leaders to ensure we have the organizational capacity and capabilities to execute our business
plans.

We closely monitor recruitment metrics through our internal university and experienced hire dashboards and track voluntary turnover
metrics to guide our retention activities.

Employee Engagement and Development
We focus on the engagement and development of our workforce and encourage our employees to build diverse and fulfilling careers
with ConocoPhillips. We develop our workforce through a combination of on-the-job learning, formal training, regular feedback,
coaching and mentoring. Skills-based Talent Management Teams (TMTs) guide targeted employee development and career
progression by skills, discipline and location. The TMTs help identify our workforce planning needs and assess the availability of critical
skill sets within the company. We use a performance management program focused on objectivity, credibility and transparency. The
program includes broad stakeholder feedback, real-time monetary and non-monetary recognition and a formal “how” rating to assess
behaviors to ensure they align with our SPIRIT Values.

We empower our employees to grow their careers through personal and professional development opportunities, including individual
development plans, annual career development conversations with supervisors, a voluntary 360-feedback tool and training on a broad
range of technical and professional skills. Succession planning is a top priority for management and the Board of Directors. This work
ensures we have the talent available for future leadership roles and serves to inspire employees to reach their ultimate potential and
limit business interruption.

Taking steps to measure and assess employee satisfaction and engagement is at the heart of long-term business success and creating
a great place to work for our global workforce. Since 2019, the ConocoPhillips Perspectives Survey has become our primary listening
platform for gathering feedback on employee sentiment and promoting our “Who We Are” culture. Our leadership reviews the survey
feedback to guide priorities and goals. Our employee feedback strategy is delivered through this annual engagement survey and as
needed; shorter ad hoc pulse surveys are leveraged to unlock targeted insights in support of our human capital priorities.

Compensation, Benefits and Well-Being
We offer competitive, performance-based compensation packages and have global equitable pay practices. Our compensation
programs are generally comprised of a base pay, the annual Variable Cash Incentive Program (VCIP) and, for eligible employees, the
Restricted Stock Unit (RSU) program. From the CEO to the frontline worker, every employee participates in VCIP, our annual incentive
program, which aligns employee compensation with ConocoPhillips’ success on critical performance metrics and also recognizes
individual performance. Our RSU program is designed to attract and retain employees, reward performance and align employee
interest with stockholders by encouraging stock ownership. Our retirement and savings plans are intended to support the financial
futures of our employees and are competitive within local markets.

We routinely benchmark our global compensation and benefits programs to ensure they are competitive, inclusive, aligned with
company culture and allow our employees to meet their individual needs and the needs of their families. We provide flexible work
schedules and competitive time off, including parental leave policies in many locations. We also offer employees flexibility through the
Hybrid Office Work (HOW) program in all of our global locations, which provides eligible employees a combination of work from both
office and home. We also provide coverage for families requiring disability support, elder care and childcare, including onsite childcare,
where access locally is a challenge.

Our global wellness programs include biometric screenings and fitness challenges designed to educate and promote a healthy lifestyle.
All employees have access to our employee assistance program, and many of our locations offer custom programs to support mental
well-being.

Compensation Risk Mitigation
We have considered the risks associated with each of our executive and broad-based compensation programs and policies. As part of
the analysis, we considered the performance measures we use as well as the different types of compensation, varied performance
measurement periods and extended vesting schedules that we utilize under each incentive compensation program. As a result of this
review, management concluded that the risks arising from our compensation policies and practices are not reasonably likely to have a
material adverse effect on the company. As part of the Board of Directors’ oversight of our risk management programs, the Human
Resources Compensation Committee (HRCC) conducts a similar review with the assistance of its independent compensation
consultant. The HRCC agrees with management’s conclusion that the risks arising from our compensation policies and practices are
not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the company.

External Engagement
We care about our neighbors in the communities in which we operate. We actively support and participate in leadership conferences,
trade associations and minority nonprofit organizations.

Our employees make our communities stronger. We are proud to support their generous involvement in local charitable activities
through employee volunteerism and giving programs that include United Way campaigns, matching gift contributions and volunteer
grants.

While we have been recognized for our ESG and DEI efforts, we know that it takes ongoing commitment to make sustainable progress.

Item 1A. Risk Factors
You should carefully consider the following risk factors in addition to the other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
These risk factors are not the only risks we face. Our business could also be affected by additional risks and uncertainties not currently
known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial. If any of these risks or other risks that are yet unknown or currently
considered immaterial were to occur, our business, operating results and financial condition, as well as the value of an investment in
our common stock, could be materially and adversely affected.

Risks Related to Our Industry

Our operating results, our ability to execute on our strategy and the carrying value of our assets are exposed to the effects of
changing commodity prices.

Among the most significant factors impacting the Company’s revenues, operating results and future rate of growth are the sales prices
for crude oil, bitumen, LNG, natural gas and NGL. These prices can fluctuate widely, and many of the factors influencing the prices are
beyond our control. Between January 2020 and December 2022, WTI crude oil prices ranged from a low of a negative $38 per barrel in
April 2020 to a high of $124 per barrel in March 2022. Given the volatility in commodity price drivers and the worldwide political and
economic environment, including potential economic slowdowns or recessions, as well as increased uncertainty generated by recent
(and potential future) armed hostilities in various oil-producing regions around the globe, prices for crude oil, bitumen, LNG, natural gas
and NGLs may continue to be volatile.

Low commodity prices could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, operating income, cash flows and liquidity, and may also
affect the amount of dividends we elect to declare and pay on our common stock and the amount of shares we elect to acquire as part
of the share repurchase program and the timing of such acquisitions. Lower prices may also limit the amount of reserves we can
produce economically, thus adversely affecting our proved reserves and reserve replacement ratio and accelerating the reduction in our
existing reserve levels as we continue production from upstream fields. Prolonged depressed prices may affect strategic decisions
related to our operations, including decisions to reduce capital investments or curtail operated production.

Significant reductions in crude oil, bitumen, LNG, natural gas and NGL prices could also require us to reduce our capital expenditures,
impair the carrying value of our assets or discontinue the classification of certain assets as proved reserves. Although it is not
reasonably practicable to quantify the impact of any future impairments or estimated change to our unit-of-production rates at this time,
our results of operations could be adversely affected as a result.

Unless we successfully develop resources, the scope of our business will decline, resulting in an adverse impact to our
business.

As we produce crude oil, bitumen, natural gas and NGLs from our existing portfolio, the amount of our remaining reserves declines. If
we are not successful in replacing the resources we produce with good prospects for future organic development or through
acquisitions, our business will decline. In addition, our ability to successfully develop our reserves is dependent on a number of factors,
including our ability to successfully navigate political and regulatory challenges to obtain and renew rights to develop and produce
hydrocarbons; our success at reservoir optimization; our ability to bring long-lead time, capital intensive projects to completion on
budget and on schedule; and our ability to efficiently and profitably operate mature properties. If we are not successful in developing the
resources in our portfolio, our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.

The exploration and production of oil and gas is a highly competitive industry.

The exploration and production of crude oil, bitumen, natural gas and NGLs is a highly competitive business. We compete with private,
public and state-owned companies in all facets of the exploration and production business, including to locate and obtain new sources
of supply and to produce crude oil, bitumen, natural gas and NGLs in an efficient, cost-effective manner. In addition, as the energy
transition progresses, we anticipate the oil and gas industry will face additional competition from alternative fuels. We must compete for
the materials, equipment, services, employees and other personnel (including geologists, geophysicists, engineers and other
specialists) necessary to conduct our business. If we are not successful in our competition, our financial condition and results of
operations may be adversely affected.

Our ability to successfully execute on our energy transition plans is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties and may
be costly to achieve.

In 2020, we announced our Paris-aligned climate risk framework, including an ambition to achieve net-zero emissions on operational
emissions by 2050. In 2022, we published our Plan for the Net-Zero Energy Transition (the “Plan”) and continued to set increasingly
ambitious targets around emissions and flaring. Our ability to achieve stated targets, goals and ambitions is subject to a number of risks
and uncertainties out of our control, including the pace of development of currently undeveloped technologies, policies and markets, as
well as potential regulations that may impair our ability to execute on current or future plans. Furthermore, we are still in the planning
stages, and execution could be costly and have unforeseen obstacles. We may be required to purchase emission credits, and there
may be insufficient offsets to achieve our goals. As advanced technologies are developed to accurately measure emissions, we may be
required to revise our emissions estimates and reduction goals. We may be adversely affected and potentially need to reduce economic
end-of-field life of certain assets and impair associated net book value due to the emissions intensity of some of our assets. Even if we
meet our goals, our efforts may be characterized as insufficient.

In 2021, we established our Low-Carbon Technologies organization to identify and evaluate business opportunities that address end-
use emissions and early-stage low-carbon technology opportunities that would leverage our existing expertise and adjacencies. While
we perform a thorough analysis on these investments, the related technologies and markets are at early stages of development and we
do not yet know what rate of return we will achieve. The success of our low-carbon strategy will in part be dependent upon the
cooperation of agencies, the support of stakeholders, the success of our investments, and our ability to apply our existing strengths and
expertise.

Any material change in the factors and assumptions underlying our estimates of crude oil, bitumen, natural gas and NGL
reserves could impair the quantity and value of those reserves.

Our proved reserve information included in this annual report represents management’s best estimates based on assumptions, as of a
specified date, of the volumes to be recovered from underground accumulations of crude oil, bitumen, natural gas and NGLs. Such
volumes cannot be directly measured and the estimates and underlying assumptions used by management are subject to substantial
risk and uncertainty. Any material changes in the factors and assumptions underlying our estimates of these items could result in a
material negative impact to the volume of reserves reported or could cause us to incur impairment expenses on property associated
with the production of those reserves. Future reserve revisions could also result from changes in, among other things, governmental
regulation and commodity prices.

Our business may be adversely affected by price controls, government-imposed limitations on production or exports of crude
oil, bitumen, LNG, natural gas and NGLs, or the unavailability of adequate gathering, processing, compression,
transportation, and pipeline facilities and equipment for our production of crude oil, bitumen, natural gas and NGLs.

As discussed herein, our operations are subject to extensive governmental regulations. From time to time, regulatory agencies have
imposed price controls and limitations on production by restricting the rate of flow of crude oil, bitumen, natural gas and NGL wells
below actual production capacity. Similarly, in response to increased domestic energy costs, circumstances determined to be in the
economic interest of the country, or a declared national emergency, governments could restrict the export or import of our products
which would adversely impact our business. Because legal requirements are frequently changed and subject to interpretation, we
cannot predict whether future restrictions on our business may be enacted or become applicable to us.

Our ability to sell and deliver the crude oil, bitumen, LNG, natural gas and NGLs that we produce also depends on the availability,
proximity, and capacity of gathering, processing, compression, transportation and pipeline facilities and equipment, as well as any
necessary diluents to prepare our crude oil, bitumen, LNG, natural gas and NGLs for transport. Furthermore, we rely on there being
sufficient facilities and takeaway capacity to support our commitment to reduce routine flaring. The facilities, equipment and diluents we
rely on may be temporarily unavailable to us due to market conditions, extreme weather events, regulatory reasons, mechanical
reasons or other factors or conditions, many of which are beyond our control. In addition, in certain newer plays, the capacity of
necessary facilities, equipment and diluents may not be sufficient to accommodate production from existing and new wells, and
construction and permitting delays, permitting costs and regulatory or other constraints could limit or delay the construction,
manufacture or other acquisition of new facilities and equipment. If any facilities, equipment or diluents, or any of the transportation
methods and channels that we rely on become unavailable for any period of time, we may incur increased costs to transport our crude
oil, bitumen, LNG, natural gas and NGLs for sale, or we may be forced to curtail our production of crude oil, bitumen, natural gas or
NGLs.

Our ability to manage risk or influence outcomes in joint ventures may be constrained.

We conduct many of our operations through joint ventures in which another joint venture partner is operator or we may not have
majority control. In these cases, the economic, business, or legal interests or goals of the operator or the voting majority may be
inconsistent with ours, and we may not be able to influence the decision making or outcomes to align with our interests or goals. Failure
by an operator or a majority, with whom we have a joint venture interest, to adequately manage the risks associated with any operations
could have an adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations of our joint ventures and, in turn, our business and
operations.

Our operations present hazards and risks that require significant and continuous oversight.

The scope and nature of our operations present a variety of significant hazards and risks, including operational hazards and risks such
as explosions, fires, product spills, severe weather, geological events, global health crises, such as epidemics and pandemics, labor
disputes, geopolitical tensions, armed hostilities, terrorist or piracy attacks, sabotage, civil unrest or cyberattacks. Our operations are
subject to the additional hazards of pollution, toxic substances and other environmental hazards and risks. Offshore activities may pose
incrementally greater risks because of complex subsurface conditions such as higher reservoir pressures, water depths and metocean
conditions. All such hazards could result in loss of human life, significant property and equipment damage, environmental pollution,
impairment of operations, substantial losses to us and damage to our reputation. Our business and operations may be disrupted if we
do not respond, or are perceived not to respond, in an appropriate manner to any of these hazards and risks or any other major crisis or
if we are unable to efficiently restore or replace affected operational components and capacity. Further, our insurance may not be
adequate to compensate us for all resulting losses, and the cost to obtain adequate coverage may increase for us in the future or may
not be available.

In addition, although we design and operate our business operations to accommodate expected climatic conditions, to the extent there
are significant changes in the earth's climate, such as more severe or frequent weather conditions in the markets where we operate or
the areas where our assets reside, we could incur increased expenses, our operations and supply chain could be adversely impacted
and demand for our products could fall.

Our business has been, and may continue to be, adversely affected by the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.

The COVID-19 pandemic and the measures put in place to address it negatively impacted the global economy, disrupted global supply
chains, reduced global demand for oil and gas and created significant volatility and disruption of financial and commodity markets.

Our business was adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and may be impacted again in the future depending on the scope
and severity of current or future outbreaks. Potential impacts to our business could include, but are not limited to, reduced demand for
our products, disruptions to our supply chain, disruptions in our contractual arrangements with our service providers, suppliers and
other counterparties, failures by our suppliers, contract manufacturers, contractors, joint venture partners and external business
partners, to meet their obligations to us, reduced workforce productivity, and voluntary or involuntary curtailments to support oil prices or
alleviate storage shortages for our products.

Any of these factors, or other cascading effects of the COVID-19 pandemic that are not currently foreseeable, could materially increase
our costs, negatively impact our revenues and damage our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity position.
The full extent and duration of any such impacts cannot be predicted at this time because of the lack of certainty surrounding the
pandemic.

Legal and Regulatory Risks

We expect to continue to incur substantial capital expenditures and operating costs as a result of our compliance with
existing and future environmental laws and regulations.

Our business is subject to numerous laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, which are expected to continue
to have an increasing impact on our operations. For a description of the most significant of these environmental laws and regulations,
see the “Contingencies—Environmental” and “Contingencies—Climate Change” sections of Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations. These laws and regulations continue to increase in both number and complexity and
affect our operations with respect to, among other things:
    • Permits required in connection with exploration, drilling, production and other activities, including those issued by national,
         subnational, and local authorities;
    • The discharge of pollutants into the environment;
    • Emissions into the atmosphere, such as nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, mercury and GHG emissions, including methane;
    • Carbon taxes;
    • The handling, use, storage, transportation, disposal and cleanup of hazardous materials and hazardous and nonhazardous
         wastes;
    • The dismantlement, abandonment and restoration of historic properties and facilities at the end of their useful lives; and
    • Exploration and production activities in certain areas, such as offshore environments, arctic fields, oil sands reservoirs and
         unconventional plays.

We have incurred and will continue to incur substantial capital, operating and maintenance, and remediation expenditures as a result of
these laws and regulations. In addition, to the extent these expenditures are assumed by a buyer as a result of a disposition, it may
result in our incurring substantial costs if the buyer is unable to satisfy these obligations. Any failure by us to comply with existing or
future laws, regulations and other requirements could result in administrative or civil penalties, criminal fines, other enforcement actions
or third-party litigation against us. To the extent these expenditures, as with all costs, are not ultimately reflected in the prices of our
products, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows in future periods could be adversely affected.

Existing and future laws, regulations and internal initiatives relating to global climate change, such as limitations on GHG
emissions, may impact or limit our business plans, result in significant expenditures, promote alternative uses of energy or
reduce demand for our products.

Continuing political and societal attention to the issue of global climate change has resulted in both existing and pending international
agreements and national, regional or local legislation and regulatory measures to limit GHG emissions, such as cap and trade regimes,
specific emission standards, carbon taxes, restrictive permitting, increased fuel efficiency standards, and incentives or mandates for
renewable and alternative energy. Although we may support the intent of legislative and regulatory measures aimed at addressing
climate-related risks, the specifics of how and when they are enacted could result in a material adverse effect to our business, financial
condition, results of operations and cash flows in future periods.

For example, in November 2021, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency published a Proposed Rule (revised and republished as a
Supplemental Proposal in November 2022) that would revise the regulations governing the emission of GHG and volatile organic
compounds from new oil and gas production facilities, and emission guidelines for states to use when revising Clean Air Act
implementation plans to limit GHG emissions from existing oil and gas facilities. While the form and substance of the regulation is not
yet final, the new regulation could result in additional capital expenditures and compliance, operating and maintenance costs, any of
which may have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.

Additionally, in 2022, the U.S. joined the international community at the 27th Conference of the Parties (COP27). At the conclusion of
COP27, the U.S. and nearly 200 other countries, including most of the other countries in which we operate, renewed solidarity to deliver
on the outstanding elements of the Paris Agreement and the Glasgow Climate Pact agreed to at the 26th Conference of the Parties in
2021. The implementation of current agreements and regulatory measures, as well as any future agreements or measures addressing
climate change and GHG emissions, may adversely increase our capital and operating expenses, impact the demand for our products,
impose taxes on our products or operations, or

require us to purchase emission credits or reduce emissions of GHGs from our operations. For example, in August 2022, the U.S.
enacted the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which includes a charge on methane emissions from selected facilities in the oil and gas
industry, including many of the facilities operated by ConocoPhillips. As a result, we may experience declines in commodity prices or
incur substantial capital expenditures and compliance, operating, maintenance and remediation costs, any of which may have an
adverse effect on our business and results of operations.

For more information on legislation or precursors for possible regulation relating to global climate change that affect or could affect our
operations and a description of the company's response, see the "Contingencies—Climate Change” sections of Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

Broader investor and societal attention to and efforts to address global climate change may limit who can do business with
us or our access to capital and could subject us to litigation.

Increasing attention to global climate change has also resulted in pressure from and upon stockholders, financial institutions and other
market participants to modify their relationships with oil and gas companies and to limit or discontinue investments, insurance and
funding to such companies. For example, a significant number of financial institutions are now members of the Glasgow Financial
Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ), thereby pledging to the goal of net zero by 2050 on scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions, as well as setting
interim targets for 2030 or earlier. While GFANZ members are not prohibited from having relationships with oil and gas companies, they
are facing intense scrutiny for providing any sort of financial support to such companies, which may lead to greater restrictions on
GFANZ members in the future. Conversely, we also face pressure from some in the investment community and certain public interest
groups to limit the focus on ESG in our decision-making. As public pressure continues to mount, our access to capital on terms we find
favorable (if it is available at all) may be limited, and our costs may increase, our reputation could be damaged, and our business and
results of operations may be otherwise adversely affected.

Furthermore, increasing attention to global climate change has resulted in an increased likelihood of governmental investigations and
private litigation, which could increase our costs or otherwise adversely affect our business. Beginning in 2017, cities, counties,
governments and other entities in several states/territories in the U.S. have filed lawsuits against oil and gas companies, including
ConocoPhillips, seeking compensatory damages and equitable relief to abate alleged climate change impacts. Additional lawsuits with
similar allegations are expected to be filed. The amounts claimed by plaintiffs are unspecified and the legal and factual issues involved
in these cases are unprecedented. ConocoPhillips believes these lawsuits are factually and legally meritless, and are an inappropriate
vehicle to address the challenges associated with climate change and will vigorously defend against such lawsuits. The ultimate
outcome and impact to us cannot be predicted with certainty, and we could incur substantial legal costs associated with defending
these and similar lawsuits in the future. We could also receive lawsuits alleging a failure or lack of diligence to meet our publicly stated
ESG goals, or alleging misrepresentation related to our ESG activity.

Political and economic developments could damage our operations and materially reduce our profitability and cash flows.

Actions of the U.S., state, local and foreign governments, through sanctions, tax and other legislation, executive orders and commercial
restrictions, could reduce our operating profitability both in the U.S. and abroad. In certain locations, restrictions on our operations;
leasing restrictions; special taxes or tax assessments; and payment transparency regulations that could require us to disclose
competitively sensitive information or might cause us to violate non-disclosure laws of other countries have been imposed or proposed
by governments or certain interest groups. In addition, we may face regulatory changes in the U.S. including, but not limited to, the
enactment of tax law changes that adversely affect the fossil fuel industry, new methane emissions standards, restrictive flaring
requirements, and more stringent environmental impact studies and reviews. We also cannot rule out the possibility of similar regulatory
shifts and attendant cost and market access implications in other international jurisdictions.

One area subject to significant political and regulatory activity is the use of hydraulic fracturing, an essential completion technique that
facilitates production of oil and natural gas otherwise trapped in lower permeability rock formations. A range of local, state, federal and
national laws and regulations currently govern or, in some hydraulic fracturing operations, prohibit hydraulic fracturing in some
jurisdictions. Although hydraulic fracturing has been conducted safely for many decades, a number of new laws, regulations and
permitting requirements are under consideration which could result in increased costs, operating restrictions, operational delays or
could limit the ability to develop oil and natural gas resources. Certain jurisdictions in which we operate have adopted or are considering
regulations that could impose new or more stringent permitting, disclosure or other regulatory requirements on hydraulic fracturing or
other oil and natural gas operations, including subsurface water disposal.

In addition, certain interest groups have also proposed ballot initiatives and constitutional amendments designed to restrict oil and
natural gas development generally and hydraulic fracturing in particular. In the event that ballot initiatives, local, state, or national
restrictions or prohibitions are adopted and result in more stringent limitations on the production and development of oil and natural gas
in areas where we conduct operations, we may incur significant costs to comply with such requirements or may experience delays or
curtailment in the permitting or pursuit of exploration, development or production activities. Such compliance costs and delays,
curtailments, limitations or prohibitions could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations, financial
condition and liquidity.

Local political and economic factors in international markets could have a material adverse effect on us.

Approximately 32 percent of our hydrocarbon production was derived from production outside the U.S. in 2022, and 32 percent of our
proved reserves, as of December 31, 2022, were located outside the U.S. We are subject to risks associated with our operations in
foreign jurisdictions and international markets, including changes in foreign governmental policies relating to crude oil, bitumen, LNG,
natural gas or NGL pricing and taxation, other political, economic or diplomatic developments (including the macro effects of
international trade policies and disputes), potentially disruptive geopolitical conditions, and international monetary and currency rate
fluctuations. For example, in response to higher energy prices resulting from the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, in December
2022, Australia’s Parliament passed legislation setting a one-year price cap on natural gas. Restrictions on production of oil and gas
could increase to the extent governments view such measures as a viable approach for pursuing national and global energy and
climate policies. In addition, some countries where we operate lack a fully independent judiciary system. This, coupled with changes in
foreign law or policy, results in a lack of legal certainty that exposes our operations to increased risks, including increased difficulty in
enforcing our agreements in those jurisdictions and increased risks of adverse actions by local government authorities, such as
expropriations. Actions by host governments, such as the expropriation of our oil assets by the Venezuelan government, have affected
operations significantly in the past and may continue to do so in the future.

In addition, the U.S. government has the authority to prevent or restrict us from doing business in foreign jurisdictions or with certain
parties. These restrictions and similar restrictions imposed by foreign governments have in the past limited our ability to operate in, or
gain access to, opportunities in various jurisdictions. Changes in domestic and international policies and regulations may also restrict
our ability to obtain or maintain licenses or permits necessary to operate in foreign jurisdictions, including those necessary for drilling
and development of wells. Similarly, the declaration of a “climate emergency” could result in actions to limit exports of our products and
other restrictions.

Any of these actions could adversely affect our business or operating results.

Other Risk Factors Facing our Business or Operations

We may need additional capital in the future, and it may not be available on acceptable terms or at all.

We have historically relied primarily upon cash generated by our business to fund our operations and strategy; however, we have also
relied from time to time on access to the capital markets for funding. There can be no assurance that additional financing will be
available in the future on acceptable terms or at all. In addition, although we anticipate we will be able to repay our existing
indebtedness when it matures or in accordance with our stated plans, there can be no assurance we will be able to do so. Our ability to
obtain additional financing or refinance our existing indebtedness when it matures or in accordance with our plans, will be subject to a
number of factors, including market conditions, our operating performance, investor sentiment and financial institution policies regarding
the oil and gas industry. If we are unable to generate sufficient funds from operations or raise additional capital for any reason, our
business could be adversely affected.

In addition, we are regularly evaluated by the major rating agencies based on a number of factors, including our financial strength and
conditions affecting the oil and gas industry generally. We and other industry companies have had our ratings reduced in the past due
to negative commodity price outlooks. Any downgrade in our credit rating or announcement that our credit rating is under review for
possible downgrade could increase the cost associated with any additional indebtedness we incur.

Our business may be adversely affected by deterioration in the credit quality of, or defaults under our contracts with, third-
parties with whom we do business.

The operation of our business requires us to engage in transactions with numerous counterparties operating in a variety of industries,
including other companies operating in the oil and gas industry. These counterparties may default on their obligations to us as a result
of operational failures or a lack of liquidity, or for other reasons, including bankruptcy. Market speculation about the credit quality of
these counterparties, or their ability to continue performing on their existing obligations, may also exacerbate any operational difficulties
or liquidity issues they are experiencing. Any default by any of our counterparties may result in our inability to perform our obligations
under agreements we have made with third-parties or may otherwise adversely affect our business or results of operations. In addition,
our rights against any of our counterparties as a result of a default may not be adequate to compensate us for the resulting harm
caused or may not be enforceable at all in some circumstances. We may also be forced to incur additional costs as we attempt to
enforce any rights we have against a defaulting counterparty, which could further adversely impact our results of operations.

Our ability to execute our capital return program is subject to certain considerations.

In December 2021, we initiated a three-tier capital return program that consists of our ordinary dividend, share repurchases and a
variable return of cash (VROC).

Ordinary dividends are authorized and determined by our Board of Directors in its sole discretion and depend upon a number of factors,
including:
     • Cash available for distribution;
     • Our results of operations and anticipated future results of operations;
     • Our financial condition, especially in relation to the anticipated future capital needs of our properties;
     • The level of distributions paid by comparable companies;
     • Our operating expenses; and
     • Other factors our Board of Directors deems relevant.

VROC distributions are also authorized and determined by our Board of Directors in its sole discretion and depend upon a number of
factors, including:
    • The anticipated level of distributions required to meet our capital returns commitment;
    • Forward prices;
    • The amount of cash we hold;
    • Total yield; and
    • Other factors our Board of Directors deems relevant.

We expect to continue to pay a quarterly ordinary dividend to our stockholders. In addition, based on the current environment, we
anticipate also paying a quarterly VROC to our shareholders staggered from the ordinary dividend payment, resulting in up to eight
cash distributions to shareholders throughout the year; however, the amount of dividends and VROC is variable and will depend upon
the above factors, and our Board of Directors may determine not to pay a dividend or VROC in a quarter or may cease declaring a
dividend or VROC at any time. For example, in October 2022, we paid a VROC of $1.40 per share, and in January 2023, we paid a
VROC of $0.70 per share.

Additionally, as of December 31, 2022, $21.6 billion of repurchase authority remained of the $45 billion share repurchase program our
Board of Directors had authorized. Our share repurchase program does not obligate us to acquire a specific number of shares during
any period, and our decision to commence, discontinue or resume repurchases in any period will depend on the same factors that our
Board of Directors may consider when declaring dividends, among other factors. In the past we have suspended our share repurchase
program in response to market downturns, including as a result of the oil market downturn that began in early 2020, and we may do so
again in the future.

Any downward revision in the amount of our ordinary dividend or VROC or the volume of shares we purchase under our share
repurchase program could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.

There are substantial risks with any acquisitions or divestitures we have completed or that we may choose to undertake.

We regularly review our portfolio and pursue growth through acquisitions and seek to divest noncore assets or businesses. We may not
be able to complete these transactions on favorable terms, on a timely basis, or at all. Even if we do complete such transactions, our
cash flow from operations may be adversely impacted or otherwise the transactions may not result in the benefits anticipated due to
various risks, including, but not limited to (i) the failure of the acquired assets or businesses to meet or exceed expected returns,
including risk of impairment; (ii) the inability to dispose of noncore assets and businesses on satisfactory terms and conditions; and (iii)
the discovery of unknown and unforeseen liabilities or other issues related to any acquisition for which contractual protections are
inadequate or we lack insurance or indemnities, including environmental liabilities, or with regard to divested assets or businesses,
claims by purchasers to whom we have provided contractual indemnification. In addition, we may face difficulties in integrating the
operations, technologies, products and personnel of any acquired assets or businesses.

Our technologies, systems and networks may be subject to cybersecurity threats.

Our business, like others within the oil and gas industry, is faced with growing cybersecurity threats as we increasingly rely on digital
technologies across our business, some of which are managed by third-party service providers on whom we rely to help us collect, host
or process information. As a result, we face various cybersecurity threats, both internal and external, such as attempts to gain
unauthorized access to, or control of, sensitive information about our operations and our employees, attempts to render our data or
systems (or those of third-parties with whom we do business, including third-party cloud and IT service providers) corrupted or
unusable, threats to the security of our facilities and infrastructure as well as those of third-parties with whom we do business, including
third-party cloud and IT service providers, and attempted cyber terrorism.

Cybersecurity threats could affect the security of our data and proprietary information housed internally and on third-party IT systems,
including the cloud. A successful attack may result in gaining unauthorized access to, or control of, and disclosure of sensitive
information about our operations and our employees and/or partners; attempts to corrupt, sabotage, or render our data or systems (or
those of third parties with whom we do business, including third-party cloud and IT service providers) unusable; theft or manipulation of
our proprietary business information, whether from insiders or external threat actors; and cyberextortion for the return of data. The
impact to our data could subject our company to potential reputational damage, legal liability, regulatory fines and penalties, and
increased compliance costs.

In addition, cybersecurity threats could also disrupt our oil and gas operations both domestically and abroad given that computers aid to
control production, our equipment and monitor our distribution systems globally and are necessary to deliver our production to market.
A disruption, failure, or a cyberattack of these operating systems, or of the networks, software and infrastructure on which they rely,
many of which are not owned or operated by us, could damage production, distribution or storage assets, delay or prevent delivery to
markets, make it difficult or impossible to accurately account for production and settle transactions, or negatively impact public health or
safety, economic security, or national security.

Although we have experienced occasional cybersecurity threats, none have currently had a material effect on our business, operations
or reputation. We will comply with government-imposed security requirements to implement specific mitigation measures to protect
against cybersecurity threats to our information and operational technology. In addition, we must continually expend additional
resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any vulnerabilities detected. We
maintain an extensive network of technical security procedures and controls, training, and policy enforcement mechanisms to monitor
and mitigate security threats and to increase security for our information, facilities and infrastructure. Despite our ongoing investments
in security resources, talent and business practices, we are unable to assure that any security measures, or measures implemented by
third parties, will be completely effective.

If our systems and infrastructure were to be breached, damaged or disrupted, we could be subject to serious negative consequences,
including disruption of our operations, damage to our reputation, a loss of employee and/or third party trust, reimbursement or other
costs, increased compliance costs, litigation exposure and legal liability or regulatory fines, penalties or intervention. In addition, we
have exposure to cybersecurity incidents and the negative impacts of such incidents related to our data and proprietary information
housed on third-party IT systems, including the cloud. Any of these could materially and adversely affect our business, results of
operations or financial condition, and any of the foregoing can be exacerbated by a delay or failure to detect a cybersecurity incident or
the full extent of such incident notwithstanding reasonable security procedures and controls. The prevalence of remote work has
introduced additional

cybersecurity risk. Although we have business continuity plans in place, our operations may be adversely affected by significant and
widespread disruption to our systems and infrastructure that support our business. While we continue to evolve and modify our
business continuity plans, there can be no assurance that they will be completely effective in avoiding disruption and business impacts.
Further, our insurance may not be adequate to compensate us for all resulting losses, and the cost to obtain adequate coverage may
increase for us in the future.


Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments
None.

Item 3. Legal Proceedings
We are a defendant in a number of legal and administrative proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business, including those
involving governmental authorities under federal, state and local laws regulating the discharge of materials into the environment. While
it is not possible to accurately predict the final outcome of these pending proceedings, if any one or more of such proceedings were to
be decided adversely to ConocoPhillips, we expect there would not be a material effect to our consolidated financial position.

ConocoPhillips has elected to use a $1 million threshold for disclosing certain proceedings arising under federal, state or local
environmental laws when a governmental authority is a party. ConocoPhillips believes proceedings under this threshold are not material
to ConocoPhillips' business and financial condition. Applying this threshold, there are no such proceedings to disclose for the year
ended December 31, 2022. See Note 11 for information regarding other legal and administrative proceedings.

authorization from $25 billion to $45 billion of common stock to support our plan for future share repurchases. As of December 31,
2022, we had repurchased $23.4 billion of shares. Repurchases are made at management’s discretion, at prevailing prices, subject to
market conditions and other factors. Except as limited by applicable legal requirements, repurchases may be increased, decreased or
discontinued at any time without prior notice. Shares of stock repurchased under the plan are held as treasury shares. For more

Stock Performance Graph
The following graph shows the cumulative TSR for ConocoPhillips’ common stock in each of the five years from December 31, 2017 to
December 31, 2022. The graph also compares the cumulative total returns for the same five-year period with the S&P 500 Index and
our performance peer group consisting of Chevron, ExxonMobil, Apache, Marathon Oil Corporation, Devon, Occidental, Hess, and
EOG weighted according to the respective peer’s stock market capitalization at the beginning of each annual period.

The comparison assumes $100 was invested on December 31, 2017, in ConocoPhillips stock, the S&P 500 Index and ConocoPhillips’
peer group and assumes that all dividends were reinvested. The cumulative total returns of the peer group companies' common stock
do not include the cumulative total return of ConocoPhillips’ common stock. The stock price performance included in this graph is not
necessarily indicative of future stock price performance.

Business Environment and Executive Overview
ConocoPhillips is one of the world’s leading E&P companies based on both production and reserves with operations and activities in 13
countries. Our diverse, low cost of supply portfolio includes resource-rich unconventional plays in North America; conventional assets in
North America, Europe, Africa and Asia; LNG developments; oil sands assets in Canada; and an inventory of global conventional and
unconventional exploration prospects. Headquartered in Houston, Texas, at December 31, 2022, we employed approximately 9,500
people worldwide and had total assets of $94 billion.

Overview
In 2022, the energy landscape continued to improve with commodity prices ultimately reaching a 10-year high before decreasing in the
second half of the year due to macroeconomic concerns. We expect prices will continue to be cyclical and volatile. Our view is that a
successful business strategy in the E&P industry must be resilient in lower price environments while also retaining upside during
periods of higher prices. As such, we are unhedged, remain highly disciplined in our investment decisions and continually monitor
market fundamentals, including the impacts associated with the conflict in Ukraine, OPEC Plus supply updates, global demand for our
products, oil and gas inventory levels, governmental policies, inflation, supply chain disruptions and the fluctuating global COVID-19
impacts.

The macro-environment, including the energy transition, continues to evolve. We believe ConocoPhillips will continue to play an
essential role by executing on three objectives: responsibly meeting energy transition pathway demand, delivering competitive returns
on and of capital and achieving our net-zero operational emissions ambition. We call this our Triple Mandate, and it represents our
commitment to create long-term value for our stakeholders.

Our value proposition to deliver competitive returns to stockholders through price cycles is guided by foundational principles that
support our Triple Mandate. Our foundational principles consist of maintaining balance sheet strength, providing peer-leading
distributions, making disciplined investments, and demonstrating responsible and reliable ESG performance.

Our actions throughout 2022 reinforced our differential value proposition. Demonstrating our commitment to maintaining and enhancing
balance sheet strength, in 2022, we executed several activities focused on debt reduction, including early retiring and refinancing some
of our debt. In aggregate, these transactions along with naturally maturing debt reduced the company's total debt by $3.3 billion. These
activities facilitate our ability to achieve our previously announced $5 billion debt reduction target by the end of 2026, while also
reducing the company's annual cash interest expense. See Note 9.

Total company production in 2022 was 1,738 MBOED, yielding cash provided by operating activities of $28.3 billion. We invested $10.2
billion into the business in the form of capital expenditures and investments and provided returns of capital to shareholders of
approximately $15.0 billion through our ordinary dividend, share repurchases and our VROC. For 2022, we returned $2.4 billion from
our ordinary dividend, which included an increase from 46 cents per share to 51 cents per share, effective in December. We also
returned $3.3 billion to shareholders from the VROC in 2022. In the first quarter of 2022, we completed the paced monetization program
of our Cenovus Energy (CVE) common shares and used the proceeds for a portion of our share repurchase program. See Note 5. In
total for 2022, we returned $9.3 billion to shareholders through share repurchases. In October 2022, our Board of Directors approved
an increase to our share repurchase authorization, increasing it from $25 billion to $45 billion to support our plan for future share
repurchases. As of December 31, 2022, we have repurchased $23.4 billion of the $45 billion authorized share repurchase program.

In February 2023, we announced our 2023 planned return of capital to shareholders of $11 billion through our three-tier return of capital
framework. We also declared a first quarter ordinary dividend of $0.51 cents per share and a VROC of $0.60 cents per share.

In 2022, we took several steps to expand our global LNG business. In the first quarter, we increased our equity share in Australia
Pacific LNG (APLNG) by 10 percent to 47.5 percent. See Note 3. We were also awarded a 25 percent interest in each of two new joint
ventures with QatarEnergy that will participate in the North Field East (NFE) and North Field South (NFS) LNG projects. Formation of
the NFE joint venture (QG8) closed in December 2022 and we anticipate that the formation of the NFS joint venture (QG12) will close in
early 2023. Also, in 2022, we executed a 15-year regasification agreement at the recently announced German LNG Terminal at
Brunsbuttel.

Domestically, in November 2022, we entered into several agreements with Sempra entities in connection with the Port Arthur LNG
(PALNG) facility, including a Sales and Purchase Agreement for 5 MTPA of LNG offtake at the start-up of Phase 1 of the PALNG facility,
and an Equity Sale and Purchase Agreement, whereby we will acquire 30 percent of the equity in Phase 1 of Port Arthur LNG.
Development of the PALNG facility is subject to completing required commercial agreements and resolving a number of risks and
uncertainties, obtaining financing and reaching a final investment decision, among other factors.

As part of our ongoing portfolio high-grading and optimization efforts, in the first quarter of 2022, we completed two transactions in our
Asia Pacific segment, including the above-mentioned acquisition of additional interest in APLNG as well as the sale of our interests in
Indonesia. In addition to those transactions, throughout 2022, we completed the sale of certain noncore assets in our Lower 48
segment. For more information on APLNG, see Note 4 and for more information on dispositions, see Note 3.

In 2022, we reaffirmed and improved upon our commitment to demonstrate responsible and reliable ESG performance by publishing
our Plan for the Net-Zero Energy Transition (the 'Plan'), which is built upon our Triple Mandate. In addition, we continue to expand upon
our Paris-aligned climate risk framework that we adopted in 2020. In July 2022, we joined the Oil and Gas Methane Partnership
(OGMP) 2.0 initiative. In October 2022, we demonstrated further evidence of our commitment by setting a new 2030 methane
emissions intensity target of approximately 0.15 percent of gas produced, consistent with our commitment to OGMP 2.0. For more
information on our commitment to ESG and the Plan, see "Contingencies—Company Response to Climate-Related Risks" section of
Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation.

Operationally, we remain focused on safely executing the business. Production increased 171 MBOED or 11 percent in 2022, compared
to 2021. Production for 2022 was 1,738 MBOED. After adjusting for closed acquisitions and dispositions, the conversion of previously
acquired Concho-contracted volumes from a two-stream to a three-stream basis and 2021 Winter Storm Uri impacts, production
decreased by 16 MBOED or 1 percent. Organic growth from Lower 48 and other development programs more than offset decline;
however, production was lower overall, primarily due to fourth quarter weather impacts and downtime in Lower 48.

Business Environment
WTI crude oil prices averaged $94 per barrel in 2022, compared with $68 per barrel in 2021. The energy industry has periodically
experienced this type of volatility due to fluctuating supply-and-demand conditions and such volatility may persist in the future.
Commodity prices are the most significant factor impacting our profitability, reinvestment of operating cash flows into our business and
distributions to shareholders. We are guided by our Triple Mandate and our foundational principles to deliver on our differential value
proposition to create value through price cycles. Our foundational principles include maintaining balance sheet strength, peer leading
distributions, disciplined investments and demonstrating responsible and reliable ESG performance, all of which support strong financial
returns.

    •   Balance sheet strength. A strong balance sheet is a strategic asset that provides flexibility through price cycles. We strive to
        maintain our ‘A’-rating, and in 2021 committed to reducing gross debt by $5 billion by the end of 2026. In 2022 we executed
        several activities focused on debt reduction and, combined with naturally maturing debt, reduced the company's total debt by
        $3.3 billion. This will reduce interest expense and provide resilience in periods of volatility. We ended the year with cash and
        cash equivalents and restricted cash of $6.7 billion and short-term investments of $2.8 billion, maintaining balance sheet
        strength.

    •   Peer leading distributions. We believe in delivering value to our shareholders via our three-tiered return of capital framework,
        which consists of a growing, sustainable ordinary dividend, share repurchases and our VROC. This framework is how we plan
        to return greater than 30 percent of our net cash provided by operating activities to shareholders. In 2022, we returned $5.7
        billion to shareholders through our ordinary dividend and VROC and $9.3 billion through share repurchases partially sourced
        from monetization of our CVE common shares. See Note 5. Our combined dividends and share repurchases of $15 billion
        represented over 50 percent of our net cash provided by operating activities. In October 2022, our Board of Directors approved
        an increase to our share repurchase authorization from $25 billion to $45 billion to support our plan for future share
        repurchases. In February 2023, we announced our 2023 planned return of capital to shareholders of $11 billion through our
        three-tier return of capital framework. See “Item 1A—Risk Factors Our ability to execute our capital return program is subject to
        certain considerations.”

    •   Disciplined investments. Our goal is to achieve strong free cash flow by exercising capital discipline, controlling our costs, and
        safely and reliably delivering production. We expect to make capital investments sufficient to sustain production throughout the
        price cycles. Free cash flow provides funds that are available to return to shareholders, strengthen the balance sheet or
        reinvest back into the business for future cash flow expansion.


                                                                                                       ConocoPhillips 2022 10-K        34
Management’s Discussion and Analysis                                                                                    Table of Contents




          ◦   Exercise capital discipline. We participate in a commodity price-driven and capital-intensive industry, with varying
              lead times from when an investment decision is made to when an asset is operational and generates cash flow. As a
              result, we must invest significant capital dollars to develop newly discovered fields, maintain existing fields, and
              construct pipelines and LNG facilities. We allocate capital across a geographically diverse, low cost of supply resource
              base, which combined with legacy assets results in low overall production decline. Cost of supply is the WTI equivalent
              price that generates a 10 percent after-tax return on a point-forward and fully burdened basis. Fully burdened includes
              capital infrastructure, foreign exchange, cost of carbon, price-related inflation and G&A. In setting our capital plans, we
              exercise a rigorous approach that evaluates projects using these cost of supply criteria, which we believe will lead to
              value maximization and cash flow expansion using an optimized investment pace, not production growth for growth’s
              sake. Our cash allocation priorities call for the investment of sufficient capital to sustain production and provide returns
              of capital to shareholders.

          ◦   Control our costs. Controlling operating and overhead costs, without compromising safety or environmental
              stewardship, is a high priority. Using various methodologies, we monitor these costs monthly, on an absolute-dollar
              basis and a per-unit basis and report to management. Managing operating and overhead costs is critical to maintaining
              a competitive position in our industry, particularly in a low commodity price environment. The ability to control our
              operating and overhead costs positively impacts our ability to deliver strong cash from operations.

          ◦   Optimize our portfolio. In 2022, we expanded upon our global LNG business by increasing our ownership in APLNG
              by 10 percent to 47.5 percent. In addition, we were also awarded interests in the NFE and NFS LNG projects in Qatar,
              signed agreements to purchase an interest in Port Arthur LNG in the U.S., and signed a 15-year regasification
              agreement with the German LNG Terminal at Brunsbuttel. See Note 4.

              We continue to evaluate our assets to determine whether they compete for capital within our portfolio and optimize as
              necessary, directing capital towards the most competitive investments and disposing of assets that do not compete. As
              such, in 2022 we completed the sale of Indonesia and certain noncore assets in the Lower 48 segment. See Note 3.

          ◦   Add to our proved reserve base. We primarily add to our proved reserve base in three ways:
                 ▪   Acquire interest in existing or new fields.
                 ▪   Apply new technologies and processes to improve recovery from existing fields.
                 ▪   Successfully explore, develop and exploit new and existing fields.

              As required by current authoritative guidelines, the estimated future date when an asset will reach the end of its
              economic life is based on historical 12-month first-of-month average prices and current costs. This date estimates when
              production will end and affects the amount of estimated reserves. Therefore, as prices and cost levels change from
              year to year, the estimate of proved reserves also changes. Generally, our proved reserves decrease as prices decline
              and increase as prices rise.

              Reserve replacement represents the net change in proved reserves, net of production, divided by our current year
              production, as shown in our supplemental reserve table disclosures. Our reserve replacement was 176 percent in
              2022, reflecting a net increase from development drilling activity as well as higher prices. Our organic reserve
              replacement, which excludes a net decrease of 6 MMBOE from sales and purchases, was 177 percent in 2022.

              In the three years ended December 31, 2022, our reserve replacement was 180 percent. Our organic reserve
              replacement during the three years ended December 31, 2022, which excludes a net increase of 1,103 MMBOE
              related to sales and purchases, was 114 percent. See "Supplementary Data - Oil and Gas Operations" for more
              information.

              Access to additional resources may become increasingly difficult as lower commodity price cycles can make projects
              uneconomic or unattractive. In addition, prohibition of direct investment in some nations, national fiscal terms, political
              instability, competition from national oil companies, and lack of access to high-potential areas due to environmental or
              other regulation may negatively impact our ability to increase our reserve base. As such, the timing and level at which
              we add to our reserve base may, or may not, allow us to fully replace our production over subsequent years.

    •   Environmental Social and Governance. ConocoPhillips seeks to fulfill our mission of delivering energy to the world through
        an integrated management system approach that assesses sustainability-related business risks and opportunities as part of our
        decision-making process. Recognizing the importance of ESG performance to our stakeholders and company success, we
        have a governance structure that extends from the board of directors through to executive leadership and business unit
        managers.

        In October 2020, we became the first U.S.-based oil and natural gas company to adopt a Paris-aligned climate risk framework
        that includes an ambition to achieve net-zero Scope 1 and 2 emissions on a gross operated and net equity basis by 2050. We
        believe that this framework, combined with our success in meeting the business objectives set by our Triple Mandate,
        represents the most effective way for us to sustainably contribute to society’s transition to a low-carbon economy. In early 2022,
        we reaffirmed and improved our commitment to demonstrate responsible and reliable ESG performance and address climate-
        related risks by publishing our Plan for the Net Zero Energy Transition, which outlines our approach and progress to address
        risks specific to the energy transition.

        ConocoPhillips believes that natural gas and oil will remain essential to the energy mix throughout the energy transition, and we
        also recognize the need for continuous reduction in the greenhouse gas intensity of production operations. The energy
        transition will likely be complex, evolving over multiple decades with many possible pathways and uncertainties. By following
        our Triple Mandate, we intend to meet this challenge in an economically viable, accountable and actionable way that creates
        long-term value for our stakeholders. For more information on our commitment to responsible and reliable ESG performance
        through the energy transition, see "Contingencies—Company Response to Climate-Related Risks" section of Management's
        Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation.

Commodity Prices
Our earnings and operating cash flows generally correlate with crude oil and natural gas commodity prices. Commodity price levels are
subject to factors external to the company and over which we have no control, including but not limited to global economic health,
supply disruptions or fears thereof caused by civil unrest or military conflicts, actions taken by OPEC Plus and other producing
countries, environmental laws, tax regulations, governmental policies, global health crises and weather-related disruptions. The
following graph depicts the average benchmark prices for WTI crude oil, Brent crude oil and U.S. Henry Hub natural gas over the past
three years:




Brent crude oil prices averaged $101.19 per barrel in 2022, an increase of 43 percent compared with $70.73 per barrel in 2021.
Similarly, average WTI crude oil prices increased 39 percent from $67.92 per barrel in 2021 to $94.23 per barrel in 2022. Prices were
higher through 2022 due to ongoing global economic recovery following 2020's COVID impacts, supply disruptions caused by Russia's
invasion of Ukraine and resulting sanctions, OPEC supply restraint and supply chain bottlenecks limiting U.S. production growth.


                                                                                                       ConocoPhillips 2022 10-K        36
Management’s Discussion and Analysis                                                                                   Table of Contents




Henry Hub natural gas prices increased 73 percent from an average of $3.85 per MMBTU in 2021 to $6.65 per MMBTU in 2022.
Natural gas prices increased due to modest growth in domestic production, healthy domestic demand and strong levels of feedgas
demand for LNG exports to Europe and Asia.

Our realized bitumen price increased 48 percent from an average of $37.52 per barrel in 2021 to $55.56 per barrel in 2022. The
increase was largely driven by strength in WTI, reflective of increasing global demand and sanctions on Russian exports. The
weakness of WCS to WTI differential at Hardisty was primarily caused by U.S. strategic petroleum reserve release, discounted Russian
crude oil and weak heavy fuel pricing. We continue to optimize bitumen price realizations through optimizing diluent recover unit
operation, blending and transportation strategies.

Our worldwide annual average realized price increased 46 percent from $54.63 per BOE in 2021 to $79.82 per BOE in 2022 primarily
due to higher commodity prices.

Outlook
Production and Capital
2023 operating plan capital expenditure guidance is $10.7 to $11.3 billion, which includes $1.6 to $2.0 billion for anticipated major
project spending at NFE, NFS, PALNG and Willow and $9.1 to $9.3 billion for ongoing development drilling programs; exploration and
appraisal activities; base maintenance; and projects to reduce the company's Scope 1 and 2 emissions intensity and fund investments
in several early-stage low-carbon opportunities that address end-use emissions.

Production guidance is 1.76 to 1.80 MMBOED in 2023. First quarter 2023 production is expected to be 1.72 MMBOED to 1.76
MMBOED, which includes 35 MBOED of turnaround and stabilizer expansion in Eagle Ford.

Operating Segments
We manage our operations through six operating segments, which are primarily defined by geographic region: Alaska; Lower 48;
Canada; Europe, Middle East and North Africa; Asia Pacific; and Other International.

Corporate and Other represents income and costs not directly associated with an operating segment, such as most interest expense,

Net Income (loss) attributable to ConocoPhillips increased $10,601 million in 2022. Earnings were positively impacted by:
    • Higher realized commodity prices.
    • Higher sales volumes primarily due to our Shell Permian acquisition, partly offset by assets divested. See Note 3.
    • Higher equity in earnings of affiliates, primarily due to higher LNG sales prices and volumes as well as the additional 10 percent
        interest in APLNG we acquired in the first quarter of 2022. See Note 3.
    • Absence of a $682 million after-tax impairment of our APLNG investment included within our Asia Pacific segment. See Note 7.
    • Recognition of a $515 million tax benefit related to the closing of an IRS audit. See Note 17.
    • Gain on dispositions primarily due to a $462 million after-tax gain related to the divestiture of our Indonesia assets, higher
        contingent payments related to prior dispositions in our Canada and Lower 48 segments and the absence of a $137 million
        after-tax loss related to the divestiture of noncore assets in our Other International segment from 2021. See Note 3.
    • Absence of restructuring and transaction expenses of $341 million after-tax related to our Concho and Shell Permian
        acquisitions.
    • Absence of realized losses on hedges of $233 million after-tax related to derivative positions acquired in our Concho
        acquisition. See Note 12.
    • Lower other expenses primarily related to an after-tax gain of $62 million associated with the extinguishment of debt from the
        first quarter of 2022. See Note 9.

These increases in net income (loss) were partly offset by:
   • Higher income tax provision.
   • Higher taxes other than income taxes, production and operating expenses and DD&A expenses due to higher prices,
        production volumes, primarily from our Shell Permian acquisition, and inflation. Partially offsetting the increase in DD&A
        expenses were lower rates from reserve revisions.
   • A gain of $251 million after-tax on our Cenovus Energy (CVE) common shares in 2022, as compared to a $1,040 million after-
        tax gain on those shares in 2021. See Note 5.
   • Absence of an after-tax gain of $194 million recognized for a final investment decision (FID) bonus associated with our
        Australia-West divestiture in 2020. See Note 11.
   • Higher exploration expenses primarily related to the impairment of certain aged, suspended wells in our Canada segment and
        increased dry hole expenses in our Europe, Middle East and North Africa segment. See Note 6.

Equity in earnings of affiliates increased $1,249 million in 2022, primarily due to higher earnings driven by higher LNG and crude prices
as well as the additional 10 percent interest in APLNG which was acquired in the first quarter of 2022. See Note 3.

Gain on dispositions increased $591 million in 2022, primarily due to the recognition of a gain of $534 million from our Indonesia
divestiture, the absence of a $179 million loss associated with the sale of noncore assets in our Other International segment and higher
contingent payments in our Canada and Lower 48 segments than in 2021. These increases were partially offset by the absence of a
$200 million gain for a FID bonus associated with our Australia-West divestiture recognized in the first quarter of 2021. See Note 3.

Other income (loss) decreased $699 million in 2022, primarily due to the absence of mark-to-market gains associated with our CVE
common shares which were fully divested in the first quarter of 2022. See Note 5. The decrease was partially offset by higher interest
income earned due to rising rates and investments.

Purchased commodities increased $15,813 million in 2022, primarily in line with higher gas and crude prices and volumes.

Production and operating expenses increased $1,312 million in 2022, due to higher volumes, primarily due to our Shell Permian
acquisition, inflation and commodity price impacts.

Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $96 million in 2022, primarily due to the absence of transaction and
restructuring expenses associated with our Concho and Shell Permian acquisitions, partially offset by higher compensation and benefits
costs, including mark-to-market impacts of certain key employee compensation programs.

Exploration expenses increased $220 million in 2022, primarily due to the impairment of certain aged, suspended wells in our Canada
segment as well as increased dry hole expenses related to our 2022 exploration and appraisal campaign in Norway.

DD&A increased $296 million in 2022 mainly due to higher overall production volumes primarily due to our Shell Permian acquisition,
partially offset by lower rates from reserve additions from development drilling and higher prices and the absence of DD&A from
divested assets.

Impairments decreased $686 million in 2022, primarily due to the absence of an impairment of our APLNG investment included within
our Asia Pacific segment in 2021. For additional information, see Note 7 and Note 13.

Taxes other than income taxes increased $1,730 million in 2022, caused primarily by higher commodity prices and higher sales
volumes.

Other Expenses decreased $149 million primarily related to a gain of $127 million associated with the extinguishment of debt from the
first quarter of 2022. See Note 9.

See Note 17—Income Taxes for information regarding our income tax provision and effective tax rate.

We explore for, produce, transport and market crude oil, bitumen, LNG, natural gas and NGLs on a worldwide basis. At December 31,
2022, our operations were producing in the U.S., Norway, Canada, Australia, China, Malaysia, Qatar and Libya.

Total production of 1,738 MBOED increased 171 MBOED or 11 percent in 2022 compared with 2021, primarily due to:
    • New wells online in the Lower 48, Alaska, Australia, China, Malaysia and Canada.
    • Acquisitions including Shell Permian in the Lower 48 and additional working interest at APLNG in our Asia Pacific segment. See
         Note 3.
    • Conversion of previously acquired Concho contracted volumes from a two-stream to a three-stream basis.

The increase in production during 2022 was partly offset by:
   • Normal field decline.
   • Divestiture of our Indonesia assets and noncore assets in the Lower 48 segment. See Note 3.

Production for 2022 was 1,738 MBOED. After adjusting for closed acquisitions and dispositions, the conversion of previously acquired
Concho-contracted volumes from a two-stream to a three-stream basis and 2021 Winter Storm Uri impacts, production decreased by
16 MBOED or 1 percent. Organic growth from Lower 48 and other development programs more than offset decline; however,
production was lower overall, primarily due to fourth quarter weather impacts and downtime in Lower 48.

The Alaska segment primarily explores for, produces, transports and markets crude oil, NGLs and natural gas. In 2022, Alaska
contributed 16 percent of our consolidated liquids production and two percent of our consolidated natural gas production.

Net Income (Loss) Attributable to ConocoPhillips
Alaska reported earnings of $2,352 million in 2022, compared with earnings of $1,386 million in 2021. Earnings were positively
impacted by higher realized commodity prices.

Earnings were negatively impacted by:
   • Higher taxes other than income taxes associated with higher realized commodity prices and higher production volumes.
   • Higher production and operating expenses driven primarily by response costs associated with a first quarter subsurface gas
       release at Alpine drill site CD1 and higher activity comprised of well workovers and gas injections.

Production
Average production increased 3 MBOED in 2022 compared with 2021, primarily due to:
   • New wells online at our Western North Slope assets.
   • Increased development activity at Greater Prudhoe Area and Greater Kuparuk Area assets.
   • Higher produced gas volumes in our Greater Prudhoe Area.

The production increase was partly offset by normal field decline.

The Lower 48 segment consists of operations located in the contiguous U.S. and the Gulf of Mexico and commercial operations. During
2022, the Lower 48 contributed 64 percent of our consolidated liquids production and 72 percent of our consolidated natural gas
production.

Net Income (Loss) Attributable to ConocoPhillips
Lower 48 reported earnings of $11,015 million in 2022, compared with earnings of $4,932 million in 2021. Earnings were positively
impacted by:
   • Higher realized prices.
   • Higher sales volumes primarily related to our Shell Permian Acquisition. See Note 3.
   • Absence of one-time impacts from our Concho and Shell Permian acquisitions including realized losses on hedges related to
       derivative positions acquired in our Concho acquisition and higher selling, general and administrative expenses for transaction
       and restructuring charges. See Note 12.

Earnings were negatively impacted by:
   • Higher production and operating expenses, DD&A expenses and taxes other than income taxes primarily due to higher
       production volumes, primarily from our Shell Permian acquisition, realized commodity prices and inflation. Partially offsetting the
       increase in DD&A expenses were lower rates from reserve additions, primarily from additional development drilling in our
       unconventional plays and certain technical revisions.

Production
Total average production increased 209 MBOED in 2022 compared with 2021, primarily due to:
    • New wells online from our development programs in Delaware Basin, Eagle Ford, Midland Basin and Bakken.
    • Higher volumes due to our Shell Permian acquisition, partially offset by assets divested. See Note 3.
    • Conversion of previously acquired Concho contracted volumes from a two-stream to a three-stream basis.

These production increases were partly offset by normal field decline.

Asset Acquisitions and Dispositions
We completed multiple divestitures of noncore oil and gas assets during 2022 totaling approximately $680 million in proceeds after
customary adjustments. These divested assets averaged approximately 18 MBOED. We also cored up strategic positions through
acquisitions of approximately $250 million after customary adjustments. See Note 3.

Our Canadian operations consist of the Surmont oil sands development in Alberta and the liquids-rich Montney unconventional play in
British Columbia and commercial operations. In 2022, Canada contributed six percent of our consolidated liquids production and three
percent of our consolidated natural gas production.

Net Income (Loss) Attributable to ConocoPhillips
Canada operations reported earnings of $714 million in 2022 compared with earnings of $458 million in 2021. Earnings were positively
impacted by:
   • Higher realized prices.
   • Contingent payments of $282 million in 2022 associated with the sale of certain assets to CVE in 2017 compared with $246
       million in 2021.

Earnings were negatively impacted by:
   • Higher exploration expenses primarily related to the impairment of certain aged, suspended wells. See Note 6.
   • Lower sales volumes.
   • Higher production and operating expenses primarily due to higher fuel gas and electricity prices at Surmont.

Production
Total average production decreased 9 MBOED in 2022 compared with 2021. The production decrease was primarily due to:
    • Normal field decline.
    • Higher royalty rates across the segment due to higher commodity prices.
    • Planned turnarounds in our Montney assets and at the Surmont Central Processing Facility 1.

These production decreases were partly offset by new wells online in our Montney asset.

The Europe, Middle East and North Africa segment consists of operations principally located in the Norwegian sector of the North Sea;
the Norwegian Sea; Qatar; Libya; and commercial and terminalling operations in the U.K. In 2022, our Europe, Middle East and North
Africa operations contributed nine percent of our consolidated liquids production and 17 percent of our consolidated natural gas
production.

Net Income (Loss) Attributable to ConocoPhillips
The Europe, Middle East and North Africa segment reported earnings of $2,244 million in 2022 compared with earnings of $1,167
million in 2021. Earnings were positively impacted by:
     • Higher realized prices.
     • Higher equity in earnings of affiliates primarily due to higher LNG sale prices.
     • Foreign exchange gains as the USD strengthened against the Norwegian Kroner.

Earnings were negatively impacted by:
   • Lower sales volumes.
Consolidated Production
Average consolidated production decreased 10 MBOED in 2022, compared with 2021. The consolidated production decrease was
primarily due to:
    • Normal field decline.
    • Field-wide turnarounds in the Greater Ekofisk Area of Norway.
    • Unplanned downtime across our Norway assets.

These production decreases were partly offset by:
   • New wells online, improved performance and higher gas exports in Norway.

Qatar Interest
During 2022, we were awarded a 25 percent interest in a new joint venture with QatarEnergy that will participate in the NFE LNG
project. Formation of the NFE joint venture (QG8) closed in December 2022. Once complete, the NFE project will have the capacity to
produce 32 MTPA. See Note 3 and Note 4.

Libya Acquisition
In November 2022, we, along with TotalEnergies completed the joint acquisition of Hess Libya Waha Ltd, which increased our interest
in the Waha Concession by 4.1 percent to 20.4 percent.

Exploration Activity
In 2022, we drilled four operated wells and participated in one partner operated well, all of which were determined to be dry holes,
including the Slagugle appraisal well which effectively delineated the 2020 discovery. Slagugle is a discovery that we are continuing to
evaluate.

At December 31, 2022, the Asia Pacific segment had operations in China, Malaysia, and Australia, and commercial operations in
China, Singapore and Japan. During 2022, Asia Pacific contributed five percent of our consolidated liquids production and six percent
of our consolidated natural gas production.

Net Income (Loss) Attributable to ConocoPhillips
Asia Pacific reported earnings of $2,736 million in 2022, compared with $453 million in 2021. The increase in earnings was mainly due
to:
    • Higher equity in earnings of affiliates reflecting higher LNG sales prices as well as our increased interest in APLNG.
    • Absence of a $688 million after-tax impairment on our APLNG investment. See Note 4 and Note 13.
    • Higher realized crude prices.
    • After-tax gain of $534 million associated with the divestiture of our Indonesian assets. See Note 3.
    • Lower DD&A expenses driven by the divestiture of our Indonesia assets.
    • Lower production and operating expenses primarily associated with the divestiture of our Indonesia assets and lower production
       costs in China.

Earnings were negatively impacted by:
   • Absence of an after-tax gain of $200 million recognized in the first quarter of 2021 related to a contingent payment from our
       Australia-West divestiture in 2020. See Note 3 and Note 11.
   • Lower sales volumes primarily due to the divestiture of our Indonesia assets.
   • Higher taxes other than income taxes primarily due to higher realized crude oil prices.

Consolidated Production
Average consolidated production decreased 45 MBOED in 2022, compared with 2021. The decrease was primarily due to:
   • The divestiture of our Indonesia assets in the first quarter of 2022.
   • Normal field decline.

These production decreases were partly offset by development activity at Bohai Bay in China and new wells online in Malaysia.

Asset Acquisitions and Dispositions
In the first quarter of 2022, we completed the acquisition of an additional 10 percent interest in APLNG increasing our ownership to 47.5
percent. Also in the first quarter, we completed the divestiture of our subsidiaries that held our Indonesia assets and operations.
Production from the disposed assets averaged approximately 33 MBOED in the three-months ended March 31, 2022. See Note 3.

Net interest consists of interest and financing expense, net of interest income and capitalized interest. Net interest expense improved
$201 million in 2022, compared with 2021, primarily due to higher interest income as well as lower interest expenses as a result of our
debt reduction transactions. See Note 9.

Corporate G&A expenses include compensation programs and staff costs. These expenses decreased by $73 million in 2022
compared with 2021, primarily due to the absence of restructuring expenses associated with our Concho acquisition, partially offset by
mark-to-market adjustments associated with certain compensation programs. See Note 16.

Technology includes our investment in new technologies or businesses, as well as licensing revenues. Activities are focused on both
conventional and tight oil reservoirs, shale gas, heavy oil, oil sands, enhanced oil recovery as well as LNG.

Other income (expense) ("Other") includes certain corporate tax-related items, foreign currency transaction gains and losses,
environmental costs associated with sites no longer in operation, other costs not directly associated with an operating segment, gains
or losses on early retirement of debt, holding gains or losses on equity securities and pension settlement expense. Earnings in “Other”
decreased by $401 million in 2022 compared with 2021. This was primarily due to a gain of $251 million on our CVE common shares in
2022, compared with a $1,040 million gain in 2021. Earnings in "Other" also decreased due to a $101 million tax impact associated with
the disposition of our Indonesia assets and higher legal accruals of $81 million. Offsetting the decreases to earnings in "Other" include
a $474 million federal tax benefit associated with the closing of the 2017 audit of our U.S. federal income tax return, the absence of a
release of a $92 million deferred tax asset associated with prior dispositions and recognizing an after-tax gain of $62 million associated
with the debt restructuring transactions.

*Capital includes total debt and total equity.

To meet our short- and long-term liquidity requirements, we look to a variety of funding sources, including cash generated from
operating activities, proceeds from asset sales, our commercial paper and credit facility programs and our ability to sell securities using
our shelf registration statement. In 2022, the primary uses of our available cash were $10.2 billion to support our ongoing capital
expenditures and investments program, $9.3 billion to repurchase common stock, $5.7 billion to pay the ordinary dividend and VROC,
$3.4 billion to reduce debt through refinancing transactions and retirements and $2.6 billion net purchases of investments. In 2022,
cash and cash equivalents increased by over $1.4 billion to $6.5 billion.

At December 31, 2022, we had cash and cash equivalents of $6.5 billion, short-term investments of $2.8 billion, and available
borrowing capacity under our credit facility of $5.5 billion, totaling approximately $14.8 billion of liquidity. We believe current cash
balances and cash generated by operations, together with access to external sources of funds as described below in the “Significant
Changes in Capital” section, will be sufficient to meet our funding requirements in the near- and long-term, including our capital
spending program, dividend payments and required debt payments.


Significant Changes in Capital
Operating Activities
Cash provided by operating activities continued to increase in 2022 totaling $28.3 billion, compared with $17.0 billion for 2021, and $4.8
billion for 2020. The increase in cash provided by operating activities from 2021 is primarily due to higher realized commodity prices,
higher sales volumes mostly due to our acquisition of Shell Permian assets and the absence of the 2021 settlement of oil and gas
hedging positions acquired from Concho. The increase in cash provided by operating activities was partly offset by foreign tax and
royalty payments in Libya and foreign tax payments in Norway in addition to U.S. tax payments.

The increase in cash from 2021 compared to 2020 is primarily due to higher realized commodity prices and higher sales volumes,
mostly resulting from our acquisition of Concho. The increase was partly offset by the $0.8 billion in settlement of oil and gas hedging
positions acquired from Concho and approximately $0.4 billion of transaction and restructuring costs.

Our short- and long-term operating cash flows are highly dependent upon prices for crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, LNG and NGLs.
Prices and margins in our industry have historically been volatile and are driven by market conditions over which we have no control.
Absent other mitigating factors, as these prices and margins fluctuate, we would expect a corresponding change in our operating cash
flows.

The level of absolute production volumes, as well as product and location mix, impacts our cash flows. Full-year production averaged
1,738 MBOED in 2022, an increase of 171 MBOED or 11 percent compared to 2021. First quarter 2023 production is expected to be
1.72 MMBOED to 1.76 MMBOED. Future production is subject to numerous uncertainties, including, among others, the volatile crude
oil and natural gas price environment, which may impact investment decisions; the effects of price changes on production sharing and
variable-royalty contracts; acquisition and disposition of fields; field production decline rates; new technologies; operating efficiencies;
timing of startups and major turnarounds; political instability; weather-related disruptions; and the addition of proved reserves through
exploratory success and their timely and cost-effective development. While we actively manage these factors, production levels can
cause variability in cash flows, although generally this variability has not been as significant as that caused by commodity prices.

To maintain or grow our production volumes on an ongoing basis, we must continue to add to our proved reserve base. Our proved
reserves generally increase as prices rise and decrease as prices decline. Reserve replacement represents the net change in proved
reserves, net of production, divided by our current year production. For information on proved reserves, including both developed and
undeveloped reserves, see the reserve table disclosures contained in “Supplementary Data – Oil and Gas Operations.” See “Item 1A—
Risk Factors – Unless we successfully develop resources, the scope of our business will decline, resulting in an adverse impact to our
business.”

As discussed in the “Critical Accounting Estimates” section, engineering estimates of proved reserves are imprecise; therefore,
reserves may be revised upward or downward each year due to the impact of changes in commodity prices or as more technical data
becomes available on reservoirs. It is not possible to reliably predict how revisions will impact future reserve quantities.

Investing Activities
In 2022, we invested $10.2 billion in capital expenditures and investments; $2.1 billion of which was acquisition capital for the additional
10 percent interest in APLNG, certain Lower 48 assets and the payments toward our investment in QG8. The remaining $8.1 billion
funded our operating capital program inclusive of growth in the Lower 48 segment through the integration of Concho and Shell Permian
assets. Capital expenditures invested in 2021 and 2020 were $5.3 billion and $4.7 billion, respectively. See the “Capital Expenditures
and Investments” section.

In 2022, we completed the monetization of our investment in CVE common shares that we began in May 2021. By the end of the first
quarter of 2022, we fully divested of our investment, recognizing proceeds of $1.4 billion and directing proceeds toward our existing
share repurchase program. Since inception, we generated total proceeds of $2.5 billion. See Note 5. Other proceeds from dispositions
received in the current year include our divestitures in Asia Pacific and Lower 48 segments for approximately $1.5 billion after
customary adjustments and $500 million in contingent payments associated with prior divestitures. See Note 3.

In December 2021, we completed our acquisition of Shell’s assets in the Delaware Basin for cash consideration of approximately $8.7
billion after customary adjustments. We funded this transaction with cash on hand. We completed our acquisition of Concho on January
15, 2021 in an all-stock transaction. The assets acquired in the transaction included $382 million of cash. The net impact of these items
is recognized within “Acquisition of businesses, net of cash acquired” on our consolidated statement of cash flows. See Note 3.

In 2021, total proceeds from asset dispositions were $1.7 billion. We received cash proceeds of $250 million from the sale of noncore
assets in our Lower 48 segment and $1.1 billion from sales of our investment in CVE common shares and $244 million of contingent
payments related to dispositions completed before 2021. See Note 3 and Note 5.

In 2020, proceeds from asset sales were $1.3 billion. We received cash proceeds of $765 million for the divestiture of our Australia-
West assets and operations. We also received proceeds of $359 million and $184 million from the sale of our Niobrara interests and
Waddell Ranch interests in the Lower 48, respectively. See Note 3.

We invest in short-term investments as part of our cash investment strategy, the primary objective of which is to protect principal,
maintain liquidity and provide yield and total returns; these investments include time deposits, commercial paper, as well as debt
securities classified as available for sale. Funds for short-term needs to support our operating plan and provide resiliency to react to
short-term price volatility are invested in highly liquid instruments with maturities within the year. Funds we consider available to
maintain resiliency in longer term price downturns and to capture opportunities outside a given operating plan may be invested in
instruments with maturities greater than one year. See Note 12 and Note 19.

Financing Activities
In February 2022, we refinanced our revolving credit facility from a total aggregate principal amount of $6.0 billion to $5.5 billion with an
expiration date of February 2027. Our revolving credit facility may be used for direct bank borrowings, the issuance of letters of credit
totaling up to $500 million, or as support for our commercial paper program. The revolving credit facility is broadly syndicated among
financial institutions and does not contain any material adverse change provisions or any covenants requiring maintenance of specified
financial ratios or credit ratings. The facility agreement contains a cross-default provision relating to the failure to pay principal or
interest on other debt obligations of $200 million or more by ConocoPhillips, or any of its consolidated subsidiaries. The amount of the
facility is not subject to the redetermination prior to its expiration date.

Credit facility borrowings may bear interest at a margin above the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR). The agreement calls for
commitment fees on available, but unused, amounts. The agreement also contains early termination rights if our current directors or
their approved successors cease to be a majority of the Board of Directors.

The revolving credit facility supports ConocoPhillips Company’s ability to issue up to $5.5 billion of commercial paper, which is primarily
a funding source for short-term working capital needs. Commercial paper maturities are generally limited to 90 days. With no
commercial paper outstanding and no direct borrowings or letters of credit, we had access to $5.5 billion in available borrowing capacity
under our revolving credit facility at December 31, 2022.

Our debt balance at December 31, 2022 was $16.6 billion compared with $19.9 billion at December 31, 2021. The current portion of
debt, including payments for finance leases, is $0.4 billion. In 2022, we repurchased notes, retired floating rate debt, and executed a
debt refinancing comprised of concurrent transactions including new debt issuances, a cash tender offer and debt exchange offers. In
aggregate, these transactions along with naturally maturing debt, reduced the company's total debt by $3.3 billion. The refinancing
facilitates our ability to achieve our previously announced $5 billion debt reduction target by the end of 2026 while also reducing the
company's annual cash interest expense.

The current credit ratings on our long-term debt are:
   • Fitch: “A” with a “stable” outlook
   • S&P: “A-” with a “stable” outlook
   • Moody's: "A2" with a "stable" outlook

See Note 9 for additional information on debt, revolving credit facility and credit ratings.

We do not have any ratings triggers on any of our corporate debt that would cause an automatic default, and thereby impact our access
to liquidity, upon downgrade of our credit ratings. If our credit ratings are downgraded from their current levels, it could increase the cost
of corporate debt available to us and restrict our access to the commercial paper markets. If our credit rating were to deteriorate to a
level prohibiting us from accessing the commercial paper market, we would still be able to access funds under our revolving credit
facility.

Certain of our project-related contracts, commercial contracts and derivative instruments contain provisions requiring us to post
collateral. Many of these contracts and instruments permit us to post either cash or letters of credit as collateral. At December 31, 2022
and December 31, 2021, we had direct bank letters of credit of $368 million and $337 million, respectively, which secured performance
obligations related to various purchase commitments incident to the ordinary conduct of business. In the event of a credit rating
downgrade, we may be required to post additional letters of credit.

Shelf Registration
We have a universal shelf registration statement on file with the SEC under which we have the ability to issue and sell an indeterminate
amount of various types of debt and equity securities.

Capital Requirements
For information about our capital expenditures and investments, see the “Capital Expenditures and Investments” section.

Our debt balance at December 31, 2022, was $16.6 billion, a decrease of $3.3 billion from the balance at December 31, 2021 of $19.9
billion. As part of our objective to maintain a strong balance sheet, we announced in 2021 our intention to reduce our total debt by
$5 billion by the end of 2026. In 2022, we executed concurrent debt refinancing transactions, repurchased existing notes and retired
floating rate notes upon natural maturity, that in aggregate reduced the company's total debt by $3.3 billion and progressed the
achievement of our debt reduction target while also lowering our annual cash interest expense and extending the weighted average
maturity of our debt portfolio. See Note 9.

In February 2023, we announced our 2023 planned return of capital to shareholders of $11 billion through our three-tier return of capital
framework. We plan to deliver a compelling, growing ordinary dividend, through-cycle share repurchases and a VROC payment. The
VROC provides a flexible tool for meeting our commitment of returning greater than 30 percent of cash from operating activities during
periods where commodity prices are meaningfully higher than our planning price range. Our 2022 total capital returned was $15 billion.

Consistent with our commitment to deliver value to shareholders, in 2022, we paid ordinary dividends of $1.89 per common share and
VROC payments of $2.60 per common share. This was an increase over 2021 and 2020, when we paid only ordinary dividends of
$1.75 and $1.69 per common share, respectively. In February 2023, we declared a first quarter ordinary dividend of $0.51 cents per
share and a VROC of $0.60 cents per share. The ordinary dividend of $0.51 cents per share is payable March 1, 2023, to shareholders
of record on February 14, 2023. The VROC of $0.60 cents per share is payable April 14, 2023, to shareholders of record on March 29,
2023.

The ordinary dividend and VROC are subject to numerous considerations and will be determined and approved each quarter by the
Board of Directors. If approved, we expect to announce the VROC when we announce our ordinary dividend, but the quarterly payouts
will be staggered from the ordinary dividend and paid in the subsequent quarter, resulting in up to eight cash distributions throughout
the year.

In late 2016, we initiated our current share repurchase program. In October 2022, our Board of Directors approved an increase to our
authorization from $25 billion to $45 billion of our common stock to support our plan for future share repurchases. Share repurchases
were $9.3 billion, $3.6 billion, and $0.9 billion in 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. As of December 31, 2022, share repurchases
since the inception of our current program totaled 334.8 million shares and $23.4 billion. Repurchases are made at management’s
discretion, at prevailing prices, subject to market conditions and other factors.

For more information on factors considered when determining the levels of returns of capital see “Item 1A—Risk Factors – Our ability to
execute our capital return program is subject to certain considerations.”

As of December 31, 2022, in addition to the priorities described above, we have contractual obligations to purchase goods and services
of approximately $19.2 billion. We expect to fulfill $8.8 billion of these obligations in 2023. These figures exclude purchase
commitments for jointly owned fields and facilities where we are not the operator. Purchase obligations of $5.0 billion are related to
agreements to access and utilize the capacity of third-party equipment and facilities, including pipelines and LNG product terminals, to
transport, process, treat and store commodities. Purchase obligations of $12.7 billion are related to market-based contracts for
commodity product purchases with third parties. The remainder is primarily our net share of purchase commitments for materials and
services for jointly owned fields and facilities where we are the operator.

Our capital expenditures and investments for the three-year period ended December 31, 2022, totaled $20.2 billion. The 2022 capital
expenditures and investments supported key operating activities and acquisitions, primarily:

    •   Development activities in the Lower 48, primarily in the Delaware Basin, Eagle Ford, Midland Basin and Bakken.
    •   Appraisal and development activities in Alaska related to the Western North Slope and development activities in the Greater
        Kuparuk Area.
    •   Appraisal and development activities at Montney as well as optimization and development of oil sands in Canada.
    •   Development, exploration and appraisal activities across assets in Norway.
    •   Continued development and exploration activities in Malaysia and China.
    •   Acquisition capital associated with additional interest in APLNG and certain Lower 48 assets as well as the payment for our
        investment in QG8.


2023 Capital Budget
In February 2023, we announced our 2023 operating plan capital is expected to be between $10.7 to $11.3 billion. The plan includes
funding for ongoing development drilling programs, major projects, exploration and appraisal activities and base maintenance.

Contingencies
We are subject to legal proceedings, claims, and liabilities that arise in the ordinary course of business. We accrue for losses
associated with legal claims when such losses are considered probable and the amounts can be reasonably estimated. See “Critical
Accounting Estimates” and Note 11 for information on contingencies.

Legal and Tax Matters
We are subject to various lawsuits and claims, including but not limited to matters involving oil and gas royalty and severance tax
payments, gas measurement and valuation methods, contract disputes, environmental damages, climate change, personal injury, and
property damage. Our primary exposures for such matters relate to alleged royalty and tax underpayments on certain federal, state and
privately owned properties, claims of alleged environmental contamination and damages from historic operations, and climate change.
We will continue to defend ourselves vigorously in these matters.

Our legal organization applies its knowledge, experience, and professional judgment to the specific characteristics of our cases,
employing a litigation management process to manage and monitor the legal proceedings against us. Our process facilitates the early
evaluation and quantification of potential exposures in individual cases. This process also enables us to track those cases that have
been scheduled for trial and/or mediation. Based on professional judgment and experience in using these litigation management tools
and available information about current developments in all our cases, our legal organization regularly assesses the adequacy of
current accruals and determines if adjustment of existing accruals, or establishment of new accruals, is required. See Note 17.

Environmental
We are subject to the same numerous international, federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations as other companies in
our industry. The most significant of these environmental laws and regulations include, among others, the:
    • U.S. Federal Clean Air Act, which governs air emissions.
    • U.S. Federal Clean Water Act, which governs discharges to water bodies.
    • European Union Regulation for Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH).
    • U.S. Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA or Superfund), which
        imposes liability on generators, transporters and arrangers of hazardous substances at sites where hazardous substance
        releases have occurred or are threatening to occur.
    • U.S. Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), which governs the treatment, storage, and disposal of solid
        waste.
    • U.S. Federal Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA90), under which owners and operators of onshore facilities and pipelines, lessees
        or permittees of an area in which an offshore facility is located, and owners and operators of vessels are liable for removal
        costs and damages that result from a discharge of oil into navigable waters of the U.S.
    • U.S. Federal Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA), which requires facilities to report toxic chemical
        inventories with local emergency planning committees and response departments.
    • U.S. Federal Safe Drinking Water Act, which governs the disposal of wastewater in underground injection wells.
    • U.S. Department of the Interior regulations, which relate to offshore oil and gas operations in U.S. waters and impose liability for
        the cost of pollution cleanup resulting from operations, as well as potential liability for pollution damages.
    • European Union Trading Directive resulting in European Emissions Trading Scheme.

These laws and their implementing regulations set limits on emissions and, in the case of discharges to water, establish water quality
limits. They also establish standards and impose obligations for the remediation of releases of hazardous substances and hazardous
wastes. In most cases, these regulations require permits in association with new or modified operations. These permits can require an
applicant to collect substantial information in connection with the application process, which can be expensive and time-consuming. In
addition, there can be delays associated with notice and comment periods and the agency’s processing of the application. Many of the
delays associated with the permitting process are beyond the control of the applicant.

Many states and foreign countries where we operate also have or are developing, similar environmental laws and regulations governing
these same types of activities. While similar, in some cases these regulations may impose additional, or more stringent, requirements
that can add to the cost and difficulty of marketing or transporting products across state and international borders.

The ultimate financial impact arising from environmental laws and regulations is neither clearly known nor easily determinable as new
standards, such as air emission standards and water quality standards, continue to evolve. However, environmental laws and
regulations, including those that may arise to address concerns about global climate change, are expected to continue to have an
increasing impact on our operations in the U.S. and in other countries in which we operate. Notable areas of potential impacts include
air emission compliance and remediation obligations in the U.S. and Canada.

An example is the use of hydraulic fracturing, an essential completion technique that facilitates production of oil and natural gas
otherwise trapped in lower permeability rock formations. A range of local, state, federal, or national laws and regulations currently
govern hydraulic fracturing operations, with hydraulic fracturing currently prohibited in some jurisdictions. Although hydraulic fracturing
has been conducted for many decades, potential new laws, regulations and permitting requirements from various state environmental
agencies, and others could result in increased costs, operating restrictions, operational delays and/or limit the ability to develop oil and
natural gas resources. Governmental restrictions on hydraulic fracturing could impact the overall profitability or viability of certain of our
oil and natural gas investments. We have adopted operating principles that incorporate established industry standards designed to
meet or exceed government requirements. Our practices continually evolve as technology improves and regulations change.

We also are subject to certain laws and regulations relating to environmental remediation obligations associated with current and past
operations. Such laws and regulations include CERCLA and RCRA and their state equivalents. Longer-term expenditures are subject to
considerable uncertainty and may fluctuate significantly.

We occasionally receive requests for information or notices of potential liability from the EPA and state environmental agencies alleging
that we are a potentially responsible party under CERCLA or an equivalent state statute. On occasion, we also have been made a party
to cost recovery litigation by those agencies or by private parties. These requests, notices and lawsuits assert potential liability for
remediation costs at various sites that typically are not owned by us, but allegedly contain waste attributable to our past operations. As
of December 31, 2022, there were 15 sites around the U.S. in which we were identified as a potentially responsible party under
CERCLA and comparable state laws.

For most Superfund sites, our potential liability will be significantly less than the total site remediation costs because the percentage of
waste attributable to us, versus that attributable to all other potentially responsible parties, is relatively low. Although liability of those
potentially responsible is generally joint and several for federal sites and frequently so for state sites, other potentially responsible
parties at sites where we are a party typically have had the financial strength to meet their obligations, and where they have not, or
where potentially responsible parties could not be located, our share of liability has not increased materially. Many of the sites at which
we are potentially responsible are still under investigation by the EPA or the state agencies concerned. Prior to actual cleanup, those
potentially responsible normally assess site conditions, apportion responsibility and determine the appropriate remediation. In some
instances, we may have no liability or attain a settlement of liability. Actual cleanup costs generally occur after the parties obtain EPA or
equivalent state agency approval. There are relatively few sites where we are a major participant, and given the timing and amounts of
anticipated expenditures, neither the cost of remediation at those sites nor such costs at all CERCLA sites, in the aggregate, is
expected to have a material adverse effect on our competitive or financial condition.

Expensed environmental costs were $705 million in 2022 and are expected to be approximately $669 million and $727 million in 2023
and 2024, respectively. Capitalized environmental costs were $239 million in 2022 and are expected to be about $276 million and $314
million in 2023 and 2024, respectively.

Accrued liabilities for remediation activities are not reduced for potential recoveries from insurers or other third parties and are not
discounted (except those assumed in a purchase business combination, which we do record on a discounted basis).

Many of these liabilities result from CERCLA, RCRA, and similar state or international laws that require us to undertake certain
investigative and remedial activities at sites where we conduct or once conducted operations or at sites where ConocoPhillips-
generated waste was disposed. The accrual also includes a number of sites we identified that may require environmental remediation
but which are not currently the subject of CERCLA, RCRA, or other agency enforcement activities. The laws that require or address
environmental remediation may apply retroactively and regardless of fault, the legality of the original activities or the current ownership
or control of sites. If applicable, we accrue receivables for probable insurance or other third-party recoveries. In the future, we may incur
significant costs under both CERCLA and RCRA.

Remediation activities vary substantially in duration and cost from site to site, depending on the mix of unique site characteristics,
evolving remediation technologies, diverse regulatory agencies and enforcement policies, and the presence or absence of potentially
liable third parties. Therefore, it is difficult to develop reasonable estimates of future site remediation costs.

At December 31, 2022, our balance sheet included total accrued environmental costs of $182 million, compared with $187 million at
December 31, 2021, for remediation activities in the U.S. and Canada. We expect to incur a substantial amount of these expenditures
within the next 30 years.

Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, and as with other companies engaged in similar businesses, environmental costs and liabilities
are inherent concerns in our operations and products, and there can be no assurance that material costs and liabilities will not be
incurred. However, we currently do not expect any material adverse effect upon our results of operations or financial position as a result
of compliance with current environmental laws and regulations.

See Item 1A—Risk Factors – We expect to continue to incur substantial capital expenditures and operating costs as a result of our
compliance with existing and future environmental laws and regulations and Note 11 for information on environmental litigation.

Climate Change
Continuing political and social attention to the issue of global climate change has resulted in a broad range of proposed or promulgated
state, national and international laws focusing on GHG emissions reduction. These proposed or promulgated laws apply or could apply
in countries where we have interests or may have interests in the future. Laws in this field continue to evolve, and while it is not possible
to accurately estimate either a timetable for implementation or our future compliance costs relating to implementation, such laws, if
enacted, could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition. Examples of legislation and precursors for
possible regulation that do or could affect our operations include:
    • European Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS), the program through which many of the EU member states are implementing the
         Kyoto Protocol. Our cost of compliance with the EU ETS in 2022 was approximately $22 million (net share before-tax).
    • U.K. Emissions Trading Scheme, the program with which the U.K. has replaced the ETS. Our cost of compliance with the U.K.
         ETS in 2022 was approximately $0.6 million (net share before-tax).
    • The Alberta Technology Innovation and Emissions Reduction (TIER) regulation requires any existing facility with emissions
         equal to or greater than 100,000 metric tonnes of carbon dioxide, or equivalent, per year to meet a facility benchmark intensity.
         We did not incur costs related to this regulation in 2022.
    • The U.S. Supreme Court decision in Massachusetts v. EPA, 549 U.S. 497, 127 S.Ct. 1438 (2007), confirmed that the EPA has
         the authority to regulate carbon dioxide as an “air pollutant” under the Federal Clean Air Act.
    • The U.S. EPA’s announcement on March 29, 2010 (published as “Interpretation of Regulations that Determine Pollutants
         Covered by Clean Air Act Permitting Programs,” 75 Fed. Reg. 17004 (April 2, 2010)), and the EPA’s and U.S. Department of
         Transportation’s joint promulgation of a Final Rule on April 1, 2010, that triggers regulation of GHGs under the Clean Air Act,
         may trigger more climate-based claims for damages, and may result in longer agency review time for development projects.
    • The U.S. EPA’s announcement on January 14, 2015, outlining a series of steps it plans to take to address methane and smog-
         forming volatile organic compound emissions from the oil and gas industry.
    • The U.S. government has announced on September 17, 2021 the Global Methane Pledge, a global initiative to reduce global
         methane emissions by at least 30 percent from 2020 levels by 2030.
    • Carbon taxes in certain jurisdictions. Our cost of compliance with Norwegian carbon legislation in 2022 were fees of
         approximately $36 million (net share before-tax). We also incur a carbon tax for emissions from fossil fuel combustion in our
         British Columbia and Alberta operations in Canada, totaling approximately $6 million (net share before-tax).
    • The agreement reached in Paris in December 2015 at the 21st Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework
         Convention on Climate Change, setting out a process for achieving global emissions reductions. The new administration has
         recommitted the United States to the Paris Agreement, and a significant number of U.S. state and local governments and major
         corporations headquartered in the U.S. have also announced related commitments. Accordingly, the U.S. administration set a
         new target on April 22, 2021 of a 50 to 52 percent reduction in GHG emissions from 2005 levels in 2030.

In the U.S., the Council on Environmental Quality's April 19, 2022 revised regulations and January 9, 2023 National Environmental
Policy Act Guidance on Consideration of Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Climate Change for implementing the National Environmental
Policy Act (NEPA) require federal agencies to evaluate, among other things, the direct, indirect, and cumulative effects of proposed
projects subject to federal authorization, including a project's GHG emissions and potential climate change impact. The new NEPA
regulations may result in longer agency review time or difficulty obtaining federal approval for development projects in our industry.
Furthermore, additional regulations are forthcoming at the federal and state levels with respect to GHG emissions, including EPA’s
November 2022 supplemental proposal to strengthen methane emissions standards for new oil and gas facilities and establishing first-
time presumptive standards for existing oil and gas facilities, as well as BLM’s November 2022 proposed regulations to reduce the
waste of natural gas from venting, flaring, and leaks during oil and gas production activities on Federal and Indian leases. Such
regulations, when finalized, may result in the creation of additional costs in the form of taxes, royalty payments, the restriction of output,
investments of capital to maintain compliance with laws and regulations, or required acquisition or trading of emission allowances. We
are working to continuously improve operational and energy efficiency through resource and energy conservation throughout our
operations.

Compliance with changes in laws and regulations that create a GHG tax, emission trading scheme or GHG reduction policies could
significantly increase our costs, reduce demand for fossil energy derived products, impact the cost and availability of capital and
increase our exposure to litigation. Such laws and regulations could also increase demand for less carbon intensive energy sources,
including natural gas. The ultimate impact on our financial performance, either positive or negative, will depend on a number of factors,
including but not limited to:
     • Whether and to what extent legislation or regulation is enacted.
     • The timing of the introduction of such legislation or regulation.
     • The nature of the legislation (such as a cap and trade system or a tax on emissions) or regulation.
     • The price placed on GHG emissions (either by the market or through a tax).
     • The GHG reductions required.
     • The price and availability of offsets.
     • The amount and allocation of allowances.
     • Technological and scientific developments leading to new products or services.
     • Any potential significant physical effects of climate change (such as increased severe weather events, changes in sea levels
         and changes in temperature).
     • Whether, and the extent to which, increased compliance costs are ultimately reflected in the prices of our products and services.

See Item 1A—Risk Factors – Existing and future laws, regulations and internal initiatives relating to global climate changes, such as
limitations on GHG emissions may impact or limit our business plans, result in significant expenditures, promote alternative uses of
energy or reduce demand for our products and Note 11 for information on climate change litigation.

Company Response to Climate-Related Risks
Our current Climate Risk Strategy and actions for our oil and gas operations are aligned with the aims of the Paris Agreement while
being responsive to shareholder interests for long-term value and competitive returns and is also aligned with our Triple Mandate to
responsibly meet energy transition pathway demand, deliver competitive returns on and of capital and achieve our net-zero operational
emissions ambition.

In 2020 we became the first U.S.-based oil and gas company to adopt a Paris-aligned climate-risk strategy with an ambition to become
a net-zero company for operational (Scope 1 and 2) emissions by 2050. The objective of our Climate Risk Strategy is to manage
climate-related risk, optimize opportunities and equip the company to respond to changes in key uncertainties, including government
policies around the world, technologies for emissions reduction, alternative energy technologies and changes in consumer trends. The
strategy sets out our choices around portfolio composition, emissions reductions, targets and incentives, emissions-related technology
development, and our climate-related policy and finance sector engagement.

In early 2022, we published our plan for the Net-Zero Energy Transition (the 'Plan'), to outline how we intend to apply our strategic
capabilities and resources to meet the challenges posed by climate change in an economically viable, accountable and actionable way
that balances the interests of our stakeholders.

Key elements of our plan include:
   • Maintaining a resilient asset portfolio focused on resources with the low cost of supply and low greenhouse gas intensity
       needed to remain viable in any scenario.
   • Setting emissions-reduction targets over the near, medium and long terms for Scope 1 and 2 operational emissions, methane
       emissions intensity and flaring.
   • Expanding policy advocacy beyond carbon pricing to include demand-side policy and regulatory action such as direct federal
       regulation of methane, advocating for alternative transportation and power generation, and national policy recommendations on
       natural gas across the value chain.
   • Leveraging our assets and capabilities to develop low-carbon technologies and identify emerging business opportunities.
   • Tracking and responding to the transition through use of scenario planning to understand alternative pathways and test the
       resilience of our strategy.
   • Continuing capital discipline by incorporating scenario planning and a cost of carbon into our capital allocation decisions.

Our Plan also recognizes the importance of reducing society’s end-use emissions to meet global climate goals. As an upstream
producer, we do not control how the commodities we sell into global markets are converted into different energy products or selected for
use by consumers. This is why we have consistently taken a prominent role in advocating for a well-designed, economy wide price on
carbon and engaged in development of other policies or legislation that could address end-use emissions from high-carbon intensity
energy use. We have also expanded policy advocacy beyond carbon pricing to include regulatory action, such as support for the direct
regulation of methane.

In support of addressing our Scope 1 and 2 emissions, in 2022, we made progress in several key areas. We continued to refine our
Paris-aligned climate risk strategy, joined the Oil and Gas Methane Partnership (OGMP) 2.0 Initiative and set a new near-zero 2030

Critical Accounting Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to select appropriate accounting policies and to
make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. See Note 1 for
descriptions of our major accounting policies. Certain of these accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties to such an
extent there is a reasonable likelihood materially different amounts would have been reported under different conditions, or if different
assumptions had been used. These critical accounting estimates are discussed with the Audit and Finance Committee of the Board of
Directors at least annually. We believe the following discussions of critical accounting estimates address all important accounting areas
where the nature of accounting estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to
account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change.

Oil and Gas Accounting
Accounting for oil and gas activity is subject to special accounting rules unique to the oil and gas industry. The acquisition of G&G
seismic information, prior to the discovery of proved reserves, is expensed as incurred, similar to accounting for research and
development costs. However, leasehold acquisition costs and exploratory well costs are capitalized on the balance sheet pending
determination of whether proved oil and gas reserves have been recognized.

Property Acquisition Costs
For individually significant leaseholds, management periodically assesses for impairment based on exploration and drilling efforts to
date. For insignificant individual leasehold acquisition costs, management exercises judgment and determines a percentage probability
that the prospect ultimately will fail to find proved oil and gas reserves, including estimates of future expirations, and pools that
leasehold information with others in similar geographic areas. For prospects in areas with limited, or no, previous exploratory drilling,
the percentage probability of ultimate failure is normally judged to be quite high. This judgmental percentage is multiplied by the
leasehold acquisition cost, and that product is divided by the contractual period of the leasehold to determine a periodic leasehold
impairment charge that is reported in exploration expense. This judgmental probability percentage is reassessed and adjusted
throughout the contractual period of the leasehold based on favorable or unfavorable exploratory activity on the leasehold or on
adjacent leaseholds, and leasehold impairment amortization expense is adjusted prospectively.

At year-end 2022, we held $6.5 billion of net capitalized unproved property costs which consisted primarily of individually significant and
pooled leaseholds, mineral rights held in perpetuity by title ownership, exploratory wells currently being drilled, suspended exploratory
wells and capitalized interest. Of this amount, approximately $4.7 billion is concentrated in the Delaware and Midland Basins, where we
have an ongoing significant and active development program. Outside of the Delaware and Midland Basins, the remaining $1.8 billion is
primarily concentrated in Canada and Alaska. Management periodically assesses our unproved property for impairment based on the
results of exploration and drilling efforts and the outlook for commercialization.

Exploratory Costs
For exploratory wells, drilling costs are temporarily capitalized, or “suspended,” on the balance sheet, pending a determination of
whether potentially economic oil and gas reserves have been discovered by the drilling effort to justify development.

If exploratory wells encounter potentially economic quantities of oil and gas, the well costs remain capitalized on the balance sheet as
long as sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project is being made. The
accounting notion of “sufficient progress” is a judgmental area, but the accounting rules do prohibit continued capitalization of
suspended well costs on the expectation future market conditions will improve or new technologies will be found that would make the
development economically profitable. Often, the ability to move into the development phase and record proved reserves is dependent
on obtaining permits and government or co-venturer approvals, the timing of which is ultimately beyond our control. Exploratory well
costs remain suspended as long as we are actively pursuing such approvals and permits, and believe they will be obtained. Once all
required approvals and permits have been obtained, the projects are moved into the development phase, and the oil and gas reserves
are designated as proved reserves.

At year-end 2022, total suspended well costs were $527 million, compared with $660 million at year-end 2021. For additional
information on suspended wells, including an aging analysis, see Note 6.

Proved Reserves
Engineering estimates of the quantities of proved reserves are inherently imprecise and represent only approximate amounts because
of the judgments involved in developing such information. Reserve estimates are based on geological and engineering assessments of
in-place hydrocarbon volumes, the production plan, historical extraction recovery and processing yield factors, installed plant operating
capacity and approved operating limits. The reliability of these estimates at any point in time depends on both the quality and quantity of
the technical and economic data and the efficiency of extracting and processing the hydrocarbons.

Despite the inherent imprecision in these engineering estimates, accounting rules require disclosure of “proved” reserve estimates due
to the importance of these estimates to better understand the perceived value and future cash flows of a company’s operations. There
are several authoritative guidelines regarding the engineering criteria that must be met before estimated reserves can be designated as
“proved.” Our geosciences and reservoir engineering organization has policies and procedures in place consistent with these
authoritative guidelines. We have trained and experienced internal engineering personnel who estimate our proved reserves held by
consolidated companies, as well as our share of equity affiliates. See “Supplementary Data - Oil and Gas Operations” for additional
information.

Proved reserve estimates are adjusted annually in the fourth quarter and during the year if significant changes occur and take into
account recent production and subsurface information about each field. Also, as required by current authoritative guidelines, the
estimated future date when an asset will reach the end of its economic life is based on 12-month average prices and current costs. This
date estimates when production will end and affects the amount of estimated reserves. Therefore, as prices and cost levels change
from year to year, the estimate of proved reserves also changes. Generally, our proved reserves decrease as prices decline and
increase as prices rise.

Our proved reserves include estimated quantities related to PSCs, reported under the “economic interest” method, as well as variable-
royalty regimes, and are subject to fluctuations in commodity prices, recoverable operating expenses and capital costs. If costs remain
stable, reserve quantities attributable to recovery of costs will change inversely to changes in commodity prices. We would expect
reserves from these contracts to decrease when product prices rise and increase when prices decline.

The estimation of proved reserves is also important to the income statement because the proved reserve estimate for a field serves as
the denominator in the unit-of-production calculation of the DD&A of the capitalized costs for that asset. At year-end 2022, the net book
value of productive PP&E subject to a unit-of-production calculation was approximately $55 billion and the DD&A recorded on these
assets in 2022 was approximately $7.3 billion. The estimated proved developed reserves for our consolidated operations were 4.0
billion BOE at the end of 2021 and 3.8 billion BOE at the end of 2022. If the estimates of proved reserves used in the unit-of-production
calculations had been lower by 10 percent across all calculations, before-tax DD&A in 2022 would have increased by an estimated
$808 million.

Business Combination—Valuation of Oil and Gas Properties
For business combinations, management applies the principles of acquisition accounting under FASB ASC Topic 805 – “Business
Combinations” and allocates the purchase price to assets acquired and liabilities assumed, based on their estimated fair values as of
the acquisition date. Estimating the fair values involves making various assumptions, of which the most significant assumptions relate to
the fair values assigned to proved and unproved oil and gas properties. For significant business combinations, management generally
utilizes a discounted cash flow approach, based on market participant assumptions, and engages third party valuation experts in
preparing fair value estimates.

Significant inputs incorporated within the valuation include future commodity price assumptions and production profiles of reserve
estimates, the pace of drilling plans, future operating and development costs, inflation rates, and discount rates using a market-based
weighted average cost of capital determined at the time of the acquisition. When estimating the fair value of unproved properties,
additional risk-weighting adjustments are applied to probable and possible reserves.

The assumptions and inputs incorporated within the fair value estimates are subject to considerable management judgement and are
based on industry, market, and economic conditions prevalent at the time of the acquisition. Although we based these estimates on
assumptions believed to be reasonable, these estimates are inherently unpredictable and uncertain and actual results could differ. See
Note 3.

Impairments
Long-lived assets used in operations are assessed for impairment whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate a possible
significant deterioration in the future cash flows expected to be generated by an asset group. If there is an indication the carrying
amount of an asset may not be recovered, a recoverability test is performed using management’s assumptions for prices, volumes and
future development plans. If the sum of the undiscounted cash flows before income-taxes is less than the carrying value of the asset
group, the carrying value is written down to estimated fair value and reported as an impairment in the periods in which the
determination is made. Individual assets are grouped for impairment purposes at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash
flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets—generally on a field-by-field basis for E&P assets.
Because there usually is a lack of quoted market prices for long-lived assets, the fair value of impaired assets is typically determined
based on the present values of expected future cash flows using discount rates and prices believed to be consistent with those used by
principal market participants, or based on a multiple of operating cash flow validated with historical market transactions of similar assets
where possible.

The expected future cash flows used for impairment reviews and related fair value calculations are based on estimated future
production volumes, commodity prices, operating costs and capital decisions, considering all available evidence at the date of review.
Differing assumptions could affect the timing and the amount of an impairment in any period. See Note 6 and Note 7.

Investments in nonconsolidated entities accounted for under the equity method are assessed for impairment whenever changes in the
facts and circumstances indicate a loss in value has occurred. Such evidence of a loss in value might include our inability to recover the
carrying amount, the lack of sustained earnings capacity which would justify the current investment amount, or a current fair value less
than the investment’s carrying amount. When such a condition is judgmentally determined to be other than temporary, an impairment
charge is recognized for the difference between the investment’s carrying value and its estimated fair value. When determining whether
a decline in value is other than temporary, management considers factors such as the length of time and extent of the decline, the
investee’s financial condition and near-term prospects, and our ability and intention to retain our investment for a period that will be
sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in the market value of the investment. Since quoted market prices are usually not
available, the fair value is typically based on the present value of expected future cash flows using discount rates and prices believed to
be consistent with those used by principal market participants, plus market analysis of comparable assets owned by the investee, if
appropriate. Differing assumptions could affect the timing and the amount of an impairment of an investment in any period. See the
“APLNG” section of Note 4.

Asset Retirement Obligations and Environmental Costs
Under various contracts, permits and regulations, we have material legal obligations to remove tangible equipment and restore the land
or seabed at the end of operations at operational sites. Our largest asset removal obligations involve plugging and abandonment of
wells, removal and disposal of offshore oil and gas platforms around the world, as well as oil and gas production facilities and pipelines
in Alaska. Fair value is estimated using a present value approach, incorporating assumptions about estimated amounts and timing of
settlements and impacts of the use of technologies. Estimating future asset removal costs requires significant judgement. Most of these
removal obligations are many years, or decades, in the future and the contracts and regulations often have vague descriptions of what
removal practices and criteria must be met when the removal event actually occurs. The carrying value of our asset retirement
obligation estimate is sensitive to inputs such as asset removal technologies and costs, regulatory and other compliance
considerations, expenditure timing, and other inputs into valuation of the obligation, including discount and inflation rates, which are all
subject to change between the time of initial recognition of the liability and future settlement of our obligation.

Normally, changes in asset removal obligations are reflected in the income statement as increases or decreases to DD&A over the
remaining life of the assets. However, for assets at or nearing the end of their operations, as well as previously sold assets for which we
retained the asset removal obligation, an increase in the asset removal obligation can result in an immediate charge to earnings,
because any increase in PP&E due to the increased obligation would immediately be subject to impairment, due to the low fair value of
these properties.

In addition to asset removal obligations, under the above or similar contracts, permits and regulations, we have certain environmental-
related projects. These are primarily related to remediation activities required by Canada and various states within the U.S. at
exploration and production sites. Future environmental remediation costs are difficult to estimate because they are subject to change
due to such factors as the uncertain magnitude of cleanup costs, the unknown time and extent of such remedial actions that may be
required, and the determination of our liability in proportion to that of other responsible parties. See Note 8.

Projected Benefit Obligations
The actuarial determination of projected benefit obligations and company contribution requirements involves judgment about uncertain
future events, including estimated retirement dates, salary levels at retirement, mortality rates, lump-sum election rates, rates of return
on plan assets, future health care cost-trend rates, and rates of utilization of health care services by retirees. Due to the specialized
nature of these calculations, we engage outside actuarial firms to assist in the determination of these projected benefit obligations and
company contribution requirements. Ultimately, we will be required to fund all vested benefits under pension and postretirement benefit
plans not funded by plan assets or investment returns, but the judgmental assumptions used in the actuarial calculations significantly
affect periodic financial statements and funding patterns over time. Projected benefit obligations are particularly sensitive to the
discount rate assumption. A 100 basis-point decrease in the discount rate assumption would increase projected benefit obligations by
$600 million. Benefit expense is sensitive to the discount rate and return on plan assets assumptions. A 100 basis-point decrease in the
discount rate assumption would increase annual benefit expense by $50 million, while a 100 basis-point decrease in the return on plan
assets assumption would increase annual benefit expense by $40 million. In determining the discount rate, we use yields on high-
quality fixed income investments matched to the estimated benefit cash flows of our plans. We are also exposed to the possibility that
lump sum retirement benefits taken from pension plans during the year could exceed the total of service and interest components
of annual pension expense and trigger accelerated recognition of a portion of unrecognized net actuarial losses and
gains. These benefit payments are based on decisions by plan participants and are therefore difficult to predict. In the event there is a
significant reduction in the expected years of future service of present employees or the elimination of the accrual of defined benefits for
some or all of their future services for a significant number of employees, we could recognize a curtailment gain or loss. See Note 16.

Contingencies
A number of claims and lawsuits are made against the company arising in the ordinary course of business. Management exercises
judgment related to accounting and disclosure of these claims which includes losses, damages, and underpayments associated with
environmental remediation, tax, contracts, and other legal disputes. As we learn new facts concerning contingencies, we reassess our
position both with respect to amounts recognized and disclosed considering changes to the probability of additional losses and potential
exposure. However, actual losses can and do vary from estimates for a variety of reasons including legal, arbitration, or other third-party
decisions; settlement discussions; evaluation of scope of damages; interpretation of regulatory or contractual terms; expected timing of
future actions; and proportion of liability shared with other responsible parties. Estimated future costs related to contingencies are
subject to change as events evolve and as additional information becomes available during the administrative and litigation processes.
For additional information on contingent liabilities, see the “Contingencies” section within “Capital Resources and Liquidity” and Note 11.

Income Taxes
We are subject to income taxation in numerous jurisdictions worldwide. We record deferred tax assets and liabilities to account for the
expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements and our tax returns. We routinely
assess our deferred tax assets and reduce such assets by a valuation allowance if we deem it is more likely than not that some portion,
or all, of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In assessing the need for adjustments to existing valuation allowances, we
consider all available positive and negative evidence. Positive evidence includes reversals of temporary differences, forecasts of future
taxable income, assessment of future business assumptions and applicable tax planning strategies that are prudent and feasible.
Negative evidence includes losses in recent years as well as the forecasts of future net income (loss) in the realizable period. In making
our assessment regarding valuation allowances, we weight the evidence based on objectivity. Numerous judgments and assumptions
are inherent in the determination of future taxable income, including factors such as future operating conditions and the assessment of
the effects of foreign taxes on our U.S. federal income taxes (particularly as related to prevailing oil and gas prices). See Note 17.

We regularly assess and, if required, establish accruals for uncertain tax positions that could result from assessments of additional tax
by taxing jurisdictions in countries where we operate. We recognize a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position when it is more likely
than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, based on the technical merits of the position. These accruals for uncertain
tax positions are subject to a significant amount of judgment and are reviewed and adjusted on a periodic basis in light of changing
facts and circumstances considering the progress of ongoing tax audits, court proceedings, changes in applicable tax laws, including
tax case rulings and legislative guidance, or expiration of the applicable statute of limitations. See Note 17.

Cautionary Statement for the Purposes of the “Safe Harbor” Provisions of the Private Securities
Litigation Reform Act of 1995
This report includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934. All statements other than statements of historical fact included or incorporated by reference in this
report, including, without limitation, statements regarding our future financial position, business strategy, budgets, projected revenues,
projected costs and plans, and objectives of management for future operations, are forward-looking statements. Examples of forward-
looking statements contained in this report include our expected production growth and outlook on the business environment generally,
our expected capital budget and capital expenditures, and discussions concerning future dividends. You can often identify our forward-
looking statements by the words “anticipate,” “believe,” “budget,” “continue,” “could,” “effort,” “estimate,” “expect,” “forecast,” “intend,”
“goal,” “guidance,” “may,” “objective,” “outlook,” “plan,” “potential,” “predict,” “projection,” “seek,” “should,” “target,” “will,” “would” and
similar expressions.

We based the forward-looking statements on our current expectations, estimates and projections about ourselves and the industries in
which we operate in general. We caution you these statements are not guarantees of future performance as they involve assumptions
that, while made in good faith, may prove to be incorrect, and involve risks and uncertainties we cannot predict. In addition, we based
many of these forward-looking statements on assumptions about future events that may prove to be inaccurate. Accordingly, our actual
outcomes and results may differ materially from what we have expressed or forecast in the forward-looking statements. Any differences
could result from a variety of factors and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the following:
    • Fluctuations in crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, LNG and NGLs prices, including a prolonged decline in these prices relative to
        historical or future expected levels.
    • Global and regional changes in the demand, supply, prices, differentials or other market conditions affecting oil and gas,
        including changes as a result of any ongoing military conflict, including the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, and the global
        response to such conflict, security threats on facilities and infrastructure, or from a public health crisis or from the imposition or
        lifting of crude oil production quotas or other actions that might be imposed by OPEC and other producing countries and the
        resulting company or third-party actions in response to such changes.
    • The impact of significant declines in prices for crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, LNG and NGLs, which may result in recognition
        of impairment charges on our long-lived assets, leaseholds and nonconsolidated equity investments.
    • The potential for insufficient liquidity or other factors, such as those described herein, that could impact our ability to repurchase
        shares and declare and pay dividends, whether fixed or variable.
    • Potential failures or delays in achieving expected reserve or production levels from existing and future oil and gas
        developments, including due to operating hazards, drilling risks and the inherent uncertainties in predicting reserves and
        reservoir performance.
    • Reductions in reserves replacement rates, whether as a result of the significant declines in commodity prices or otherwise.
    • Unsuccessful exploratory drilling activities or the inability to obtain access to exploratory acreage.
    • Unexpected changes in costs, inflationary pressures or technical requirements for constructing, modifying or operating E&P
        facilities.
    • Legislative and regulatory initiatives addressing environmental concerns, including initiatives addressing the impact of global
        climate change or further regulating hydraulic fracturing, methane emissions, flaring or water disposal.
    • Significant operational or investment changes imposed by existing or future environmental statutes and regulations, including
        international agreements and national or regional legislation and regulatory measures to limit or reduce GHG emissions.
    • Substantial investment in and development use of, competing or alternative energy sources, including as a result of existing or
        future environmental rules and regulations.
    • The impact of broader societal attention to and efforts to address climate change may impact our access to capital and
        insurance.
    • Potential failures or delays in delivering on our current or future low-carbon strategy, including our inability to develop new
        technologies.
    • The impact of public health crises, including pandemics (such as COVID-19) and epidemics and any related company or
        government policies or actions.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk
Financial Instrument Market Risk
We and certain of our subsidiaries hold and issue derivative contracts and financial instruments that expose our cash flows or earnings
to changes in commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates or interest rates. We may use financial and commodity-based
derivative contracts to manage the risks produced by changes in the prices of natural gas, crude oil and related products; fluctuations in
interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates; or to capture market opportunities.

Our use of derivative instruments is governed by an “Authority Limitations” document approved by our Board of Directors that prohibits
the use of highly leveraged derivatives or derivative instruments without sufficient liquidity. The Authority Limitations document also
establishes the Value at Risk (VaR) limits for the company, and compliance with these limits is monitored daily. The Executive Vice
President and Chief Financial Officer, who reports to the Chief Executive Officer, monitors commodity price risk and risks resulting from
foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. The Commercial organization manages our commercial marketing, optimizes our
commodity flows and positions, and monitors risks.

Commodity Price Risk
Our Commercial organization uses futures, forwards, swaps and options in various markets to accomplish the following objectives:
   • Consistent with our policy to generally remain exposed to market prices, we use swap contracts to convert fixed-price sales
      contracts, which are often requested by natural gas consumers, to floating market prices.
   • Enable us to use market knowledge to capture opportunities such as moving physical commodities to more profitable locations
      and storing commodities to capture seasonal or time premiums. We may use derivatives to optimize these activities.

We use a VaR model to estimate the loss in fair value that could potentially result on a single day from the effect of adverse changes in
market conditions on the derivative financial instruments and derivative commodity contracts we hold or issue, including commodity
purchases and sales contracts recorded on the balance sheet at December 31, 2022. Using Monte Carlo simulation, a 95 percent
confidence level and a one-day holding period, the VaR for those instruments issued or held for trading purposes or held for purposes
other than trading at December 31, 2022 and 2021, was immaterial to our consolidated cash flows and net income attributable to
ConocoPhillips.

Interest Rate Risk
The following table provides information about our debt instruments that are sensitive to changes in U.S. interest rates. The table
presents principal cash flows and related weighted-average interest rates by expected maturity dates. Weighted-average variable rates
are based on effective rates at the reporting date. The carrying amount of our floating-rate debt approximates its fair value. A
hypothetical 10 percent change in prevailing interest rates would not have a material impact on interest expense associated with our
floating-rate debt. The fair value of the fixed-rate debt is measured using prices available from a pricing service that is corroborated by
market data. Changes to prevailing interest rates would not impact our cash flows associated with fixed rate debt, unless we elect to
repurchase or retire such debt prior to maturity.

Foreign Currency Exchange Risk
We have foreign currency exchange rate risk resulting from international operations. We do not comprehensively hedge the exposure to
currency exchange rate changes although we may choose to selectively hedge certain foreign currency exchange rate exposures, such
as firm commitments for capital projects or local currency tax payments, dividends and cash returns from net investments in foreign
affiliates to be remitted within the coming year, investments in equity securities and acquisitions.

At December 31, 2022 and 2021, we held foreign currency exchange forwards hedging cross-border commercial activity and foreign
currency exchange swaps for purposes of mitigating our cash-related exposures. Although these forwards and swaps hedge exposures
to fluctuations in exchange rates, we elected not to utilize hedge accounting. As a result, the change in the fair value of these foreign
currency exchange derivatives is recorded directly in earnings.

At December 31, 2022, we had outstanding foreign currency exchange forward swap contracts. Since the gain or loss on the swaps is
offset by the gain or loss from remeasuring cash related balances, and since our aggregate position in the forwards was not material,
there would be no material impact to our income from an adverse hypothetical 10 percent change in the December 2022 exchange
rates.

At December 31, 2021, we had outstanding foreign currency exchange forward contracts to buy $1.9 billion AUD at $0.715 AUD
against the U.S. dollar. Based on the assumed volatility in the fair value calculation, the net fair value of these foreign currency
contracts at December 31, 2021, was a before-tax gain of $21 million. Based on an adverse hypothetical 10 percent change in the
December 31, 2021 exchange rate, this would result in an additional before-tax loss of $134 million. The sensitivity analysis is based on
changing one assumption while holding all other assumptions constant, which in practice may be unlikely to occur, as changes in some
of the assumptions may be correlated. The contracts settled in the first quarter of 2022.

The gross notional and fair value of these positions at December 31, 2022 and 2021, were as follows:

Reports of Management
Management prepared, and is responsible for, the consolidated financial statements and the other information appearing in this annual
report. The consolidated financial statements present fairly the company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. In preparing its consolidated financial statements, the
company includes amounts that are based on estimates and judgments management believes are reasonable under the
circumstances. The company’s financial statements have been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public
accounting firm appointed by the Audit and Finance Committee of the Board of Directors and ratified by stockholders. Management has
made available to Ernst & Young LLP all of the company’s financial records and related data, as well as the minutes of stockholders’
and directors’ meetings.

Assessment of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Management is also responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. ConocoPhillips’
internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance to the company’s management and directors regarding the
preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements.

All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be
effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.

Management assessed the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. In making
this assessment, it used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal
Control—Integrated Framework (2013). Based on our assessment, we believe the company’s internal control over financial reporting
was effective as of December 31, 2022.

Ernst & Young LLP has issued an audit report on the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, and
their report is included herein.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of ConocoPhillips

Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of ConocoPhillips (the Company) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021,
the related consolidated income statement, consolidated statements of comprehensive income, changes in equity and cash flows for
each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated
financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position
of the Company at December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the
period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB),
the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control–
Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our
report dated February 16, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the
Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to
be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud.
Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to
error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence
regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used
and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe
that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements
that were communicated or required to be communicated to the Audit and Finance Committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or
disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex
judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements,

                     Accounting for asset retirement obligations for certain offshore properties
Description of the   At December 31, 2022, asset retirement obligations (ARO) totaled $6.4 billion. As further described in Note 8, the
Matter               Company records ARO in the period in which they are incurred, typically when the asset is installed at the
                     production location. The estimation of obligations related to certain offshore assets requires significant judgment
                     given the magnitude and higher estimation uncertainty related to plugging and abandonment of wells and
                     removal and disposal of offshore oil and gas platforms and facilities (collectively, removal costs). Furthermore, as
                     certain of these assets are nearing the end of their operations, the impact of changes in these ARO may result in
                     a material impact to earnings given the relatively short remaining useful lives of the assets.

                     Auditing the Company’s ARO for the obligations identified above is complex and highly judgmental due to the
                     significant estimation required by management in determining the obligations. In particular, the estimates were
                     sensitive to significant subjective assumptions such as removal cost estimates and end of field life, which are
                     affected by expectations about future market or economic conditions.

How We Addressed     We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of the Company’s
the Matter in Our    internal controls over its ARO estimation process, including management’s review of the significant assumptions
Audit                that have a material effect on the determination of the obligations. We also tested management’s controls over
                     the completeness and accuracy of the financial data used in the valuation.

                     To test the ARO for the obligations identified above, our audit procedures included, among others, assessing the
                     significant assumptions and inputs used in the valuation, including removal cost estimates and end of field life
                     assumptions. For example, we evaluated removal cost estimates by comparing to settlements and recent
                     removal activities and costs. We also compared end of field life assumptions to production forecasts.

                     Depreciation, depletion and amortization of proved oil and gas properties, plants and equipment

Description of the   At December 31, 2022, the net book value of the Company’s proved oil and gas properties, plants and
Matter               equipment (PP&E) was $55 billion, and depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD&A) expense was $7.3
                     billion for the year then ended. As described in Note 1, under the successful efforts method of accounting, DD&A
                     of PP&E on producing hydrocarbon properties and steam-assisted gravity drainage facilities and certain pipeline
                     and liquified natural gas assets (those which are expected to have a declining utilization pattern) are determined
                     by the unit-of-production method. The unit-of-production method uses proved oil and gas reserves, as estimated
                     by the Company’s internal reservoir engineers.

                     Proved oil and gas reserves estimates are based on geological and engineering assessments of in-place
                     hydrocarbon volumes, the production plan, historical extraction recovery and processing yield factors, installed
                     plant operating capacity and approved operating limits. Significant judgment is required by the Company’s
                     internal reservoir engineers in evaluating geological and engineering data when estimating proved oil and gas
                     reserves. Estimating proved oil and gas reserves also requires the selection of inputs, including oil and gas price
                     assumptions, future operating and capital costs assumptions and tax rates by jurisdiction, among others.
                     Because of the complexity involved in estimating proved oil and gas reserves, management also used an
                     independent petroleum engineering consulting firm to perform a review of the processes and controls used by
                     the Company’s internal reservoir engineers to determine estimates of proved oil and gas reserves.

                     Auditing the Company’s DD&A calculation is complex because of the use of the work of the internal reservoir
                     engineers and the independent petroleum engineering consulting firm and the evaluation of management’s
                     determination of the inputs described above used by the internal reservoir engineers in estimating proved oil and
                     gas reserves.

                        Our audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the professional qualifications and objectivity of the

                        Company’s processes and controls. In addition, in assessing whether we can use the work of the internal
                        reservoir engineers, we evaluated the completeness and accuracy of the financial data and inputs described
                        above used by the internal reservoir engineers in estimating proved oil and gas reserves by agreeing them to
                        source documentation and we identified and evaluated corroborative and contrary evidence. We also tested the
                        accuracy of the DD&A calculation, including comparing the proved oil and gas reserves amounts used in the
                        calculation to the Company’s reserve report.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of ConocoPhillips

Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited ConocoPhillips’ internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in
Internal Control–Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013
framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, ConocoPhillips (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB),
the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated income statement,
consolidated statements of comprehensive income, changes in equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2022, and the related notes and our report dated February 16, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.


Basis for Opinion
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of
the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included under the heading “Assessment of Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting” in the accompanying “Reports of Management.” Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal
control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be
independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations
of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.

Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness
exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing
such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our
opinion.


Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the
maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in
accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect
on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of
any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
Note 1—Accounting Policies
     •   Consolidation Principles and Investments—Our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of majority-owned,
         controlled subsidiaries and, if applicable, variable interest entities where we are the primary beneficiary. The equity method is
         used to account for investments in affiliates in which we have the ability to exert significant influence over the affiliates’
         operating and financial policies. When we do not have the ability to exert significant influence, the investment is measured at
         fair value except when the investment does not have a readily determinable fair value. For those exceptions, it will be
         measured at cost minus impairment, plus or minus observable price changes in orderly transactions for an identical or similar
         investment of the same issuer. Undivided interests in oil and gas joint ventures, pipelines, natural gas plants and terminals are
         consolidated on a proportionate basis. Other securities and investments are generally carried at cost. We manage our
         operations through six operating segments, defined by geographic region: Alaska; Lower 48; Canada; Europe, Middle East and
         North Africa; Asia Pacific; and Other International. See Note 24.

     •   Foreign Currency Translation—Adjustments resulting from the process of translating foreign functional currency financial
         statements into U.S. dollars are included in accumulated other comprehensive loss in common stockholders’ equity. Foreign
         currency transaction gains and losses are included in current earnings. Some of our foreign operations use their local currency
         as the functional currency.

     •   Use of Estimates—The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make
         estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosures of
         contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results could differ from these estimates.

     •   Revenue Recognition—Revenues associated with the sales of crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, LNG, NGLs and other items are
         recognized at the point in time when the customer obtains control of the asset. In evaluating when a customer has control of the
         asset, we primarily consider whether the transfer of legal title and physical delivery has occurred, whether the customer has
         significant risks and rewards of ownership and whether the customer has accepted delivery and a right to payment exists.
         These products are typically sold at prevailing market prices. We allocate variable market-based consideration to deliveries
         (performance obligations) in the current period as that consideration relates specifically to our efforts to transfer control of
         current period deliveries to the customer and represents the amount we expect to be entitled to in exchange for the related
         products. Payment is typically due within 30 days or less.

         Revenues associated with transactions commonly called buy/sell contracts, in which the purchase and sale of inventory with
         the same counterparty are entered into “in contemplation” of one another, are combined and reported net (i.e., on the same
         income statement line).

     •   Shipping and Handling Costs—We typically incur shipping and handling costs prior to control transferring to the customer and
         account for these activities as fulfillment costs. Accordingly, we include shipping and handling costs in production and operating
         expenses for production activities. Transportation costs related to marketing activities are recorded in purchased commodities.
         Freight costs billed to customers are treated as a component of the transaction price and recorded as a component of revenue
         when the customer obtains control.

     •   Cash Equivalents—Cash equivalents are highly liquid, short-term investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of
         cash and have original maturities of 90 days or less from their date of purchase. They are carried at cost plus accrued interest,
         which approximates fair value.

     •   Short-Term Investments—Short-term investments include investments in bank time deposits and marketable securities
         (commercial paper and government obligations) which are carried at cost plus accrued interest and have original maturities of
         greater than 90 days but within one year or when the remaining maturities are within one year. We also invest in financial
         instruments classified as available for sale debt securities which are carried at fair value. Those instruments are included in
         short-term investments when they have remaining maturities of one year or less, as of the balance sheet date.

     •   Long-Term Investments in Debt Securities—Long-term investments in debt securities includes financial instruments
         classified as available for sale debt securities with remaining maturities greater than one year as of the balance sheet date.
         They are carried at fair value and presented within the “Investments and long-term receivables” line of our consolidated balance
         sheet.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements                                                                             Table of Contents




   •   Inventories—We have several valuation methods for our various types of inventories and consistently use the following
        methods for each type of inventory. The majority of our commodity-related inventories are recorded at cost using the LIFO
        basis. We measure these inventories at the lower-of-cost-or-market in the aggregate. Any necessary lower-of-cost-or-market
        write-downs at year end are recorded as permanent adjustments to the LIFO cost basis. LIFO is used to better match current
        inventory costs with current revenues. Costs include both direct and indirect expenditures incurred in bringing an item or
        product to its existing condition and location, but not unusual/nonrecurring costs or research and development costs. Materials,
        supplies and other miscellaneous inventories, such as tubular goods and well equipment, are valued using various methods,
        including the weighted-average-cost method and the FIFO method, consistent with industry practice.

   •   Fair Value Measurements—Assets and liabilities measured at fair value and required to be categorized within the fair value
       hierarchy are categorized into one of three different levels depending on the observability of the inputs employed in the
       measurement. Level 1 inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 inputs are observable
       inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly through market-
       corroborated inputs. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability reflecting significant modifications to
       observable related market data or our assumptions about pricing by market participants.

   •   Derivative Instruments—Derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. If the right of offset exists and
       certain other criteria are met, derivative assets and liabilities with the same counterparty are netted on the balance sheet and
       the collateral payable or receivable is netted against derivative assets and derivative liabilities, respectively.

       Recognition and classification of the gain or loss that results from recording and adjusting a derivative to fair value depends on
       the purpose for issuing or holding the derivative. Gains and losses from derivatives not accounted for as hedges are recognized
       immediately in earnings. We do not apply hedge accounting to our derivative instruments.

   •   Oil and Gas Exploration and Development—Oil and gas exploration and development costs are accounted for using the
       successful efforts method of accounting.

           Property Acquisition Costs—Oil and gas leasehold acquisition costs are capitalized and included in the balance sheet
           caption PP&E. Leasehold impairment is recognized based on exploratory experience and management’s judgment. Upon
           achievement of all conditions necessary for reserves to be classified as proved, the associated leasehold costs are
           reclassified to proved properties.

           Exploratory Costs—Geological and geophysical costs and the costs of carrying and retaining undeveloped properties are
           expensed as incurred. Exploratory well costs are capitalized, or “suspended,” on the balance sheet pending further
           evaluation of whether economically recoverable reserves have been found. If economically recoverable reserves are not
           found, exploratory well costs are expensed as dry holes. If exploratory wells encounter potentially economic quantities of oil
           and gas, the well costs remain capitalized on the balance sheet as long as sufficient progress assessing the reserves and
           the economic and operating viability of the project is being made. For complex exploratory discoveries, it is not unusual to
           have exploratory wells remain suspended on the balance sheet for several years while we perform additional appraisal
           drilling and seismic work on the potential oil and gas field or while we seek government or co-venturer approval of
           development plans or seek environmental permitting. Once all required approvals and permits have been obtained, the
           projects are moved into the development phase, and the oil and gas resources are designated as proved reserves.

           Management reviews suspended well balances quarterly, continuously monitors the results of the additional appraisal
           drilling and seismic work, and expenses the suspended well costs as dry holes when it judges the potential field does not
           warrant further investment in the near term. See Note 6.

           Development Costs—Costs incurred to drill and equip development wells, including unsuccessful development wells, are
           capitalized.

           Depletion and Amortization—Leasehold costs of producing properties are depleted using the unit-of-production method
           based on estimated proved oil and gas reserves. Amortization of development costs is based on the unit-of-production
           method using estimated proved developed oil and gas reserves.

     •   Capitalized Interest—Interest from external borrowings is capitalized on major projects with an expected construction period of
         one year or longer. Capitalized interest is added to the cost of the underlying asset and is amortized over the useful lives of the
         assets in the same manner as the underlying assets.

     •   Depreciation and Amortization—Depreciation and amortization of PP&E on producing hydrocarbon properties and SAGD
         facilities and certain pipeline and LNG assets (those which are expected to have a declining utilization pattern), are determined
         by the unit-of-production method. Depreciation and amortization of all other PP&E are determined by either the individual-unit-
         straight-line method or the group-straight-line method (for those individual units that are highly integrated with other units).

     •   Impairment of Properties, Plants and Equipment—Long-lived assets used in operations are assessed for impairment
          whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate a possible significant deterioration in the future cash flows expected to
          be generated by an asset group. If there is an indication the carrying amount of an asset may not be recovered, a recoverability
          test is performed using management’s assumptions for prices, volumes and future development plans. If the sum of the
          undiscounted cash flows before income-taxes is less than the carrying value of the asset group, the carrying value is written
          down to estimated fair value and reported as an impairment in the period in which the determination is made. Individual assets
          are grouped for impairment purposes at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent
          of the cash flows of other groups of assets—generally on a field-by-field basis for E&P assets. Because there usually is a lack
          of quoted market prices for long-lived assets, the fair value of impaired assets is typically determined based on the present
          values of expected future cash flows using discount rates and prices believed to be consistent with those used by principal
          market participants, or based on a multiple of operating cash flow validated with historical market transactions of similar assets
          where possible.

         The expected future cash flows used for impairment reviews and related fair value calculations are based on estimated future
         production volumes, commodity prices, operating costs and capital decisions, considering all available evidence at the date of
         review. The impairment review includes cash flows from proved developed and undeveloped reserves, including any
         development expenditures necessary to achieve that production. Additionally, when probable and possible reserves exist, an
         appropriate risk-adjusted amount of these reserves may be included in the impairment calculation.

         Long-lived assets committed by management for disposal within one year are accounted for at the lower of amortized cost or
         fair value, less cost to sell, with fair value determined using a binding negotiated price, if available, or present value of expected
         future cash flows as previously described.

     •   Maintenance and Repairs—Costs of maintenance and repairs, which are not significant improvements, are expensed when
         incurred.

     •   Property Dispositions—When complete units of depreciable property are sold, the asset cost and related accumulated
         depreciation are eliminated, with any gain or loss reflected in the “Gain on dispositions” line of our consolidated income
         statement. When partial units of depreciable property are disposed of or retired which do not significantly alter the DD&A rate,
         the difference between asset cost and salvage value is charged or credited to accumulated depreciation.

     •   Asset Retirement Obligations and Environmental Costs—The fair value of legal obligations to retire and remove long-lived
         assets are recorded in the period in which the obligation is incurred (typically when the asset is installed at the production
         location). Fair value is estimated using a present value approach, incorporating assumptions about estimated amounts and
         timing of settlements and impacts of the use of technologies. See Note 8.

         Environmental expenditures are expensed or capitalized, depending upon their future economic benefit. Expenditures relating
         to an existing condition caused by past operations, and those having no future economic benefit, are expensed. Liabilities for
         environmental expenditures are recorded on an undiscounted basis (unless acquired through a business combination, which
         we record on a discounted basis) when environmental assessments or cleanups are probable and the costs can be reasonably
         estimated. Recoveries of environmental remediation costs from other parties are recorded as assets when their receipt is
         probable and estimable.

   •   Impairment of Investments in Nonconsolidated Entities—Investments in nonconsolidated entities are assessed for
        impairment whenever changes in the facts and circumstances indicate a loss in value has occurred. When such a condition is
        judgmentally determined to be other than temporary, the carrying value of the investment is written down to fair value. The fair
        value of the impaired investment is based on quoted market prices, if available, or upon the present value of expected future
        cash flows using discount rates and prices believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants, plus
        market analysis of comparable assets owned by the investee, if appropriate.

   •   Guarantees—The fair value of a guarantee is determined and recorded as a liability at the time the guarantee is given. The
       initial liability is subsequently reduced as we are released from exposure under the guarantee. We amortize the guarantee
       liability over the relevant time period, if one exists, based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each type of guarantee.
       In cases where the guarantee term is indefinite, we reverse the liability when we have information indicating the liability is
       essentially relieved or amortize it over an appropriate time period as the fair value of our guarantee exposure declines over
       time. We amortize the guarantee liability to the related income statement line item based on the nature of the guarantee. When
       it becomes probable that we will have to perform on a guarantee, we accrue a separate liability if it is reasonably estimable,
       based on the facts and circumstances at that time. We reverse the fair value liability only when there is no further exposure
       under the guarantee.

   •   Share-Based Compensation—We recognize share-based compensation expense over the shorter of the service period (i.e.,
       the stated period of time required to earn the award) or the period beginning at the start of the service period and ending when
       an employee first becomes eligible for retirement. We have elected to recognize expense on a straight-line basis over the
       service period for the entire award, whether the award was granted with ratable or cliff vesting.

   •   Income Taxes—Deferred income taxes are computed using the liability method and are provided on all temporary differences
        between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities, except for deferred taxes on income and
        temporary differences related to the cumulative translation adjustment considered to be permanently reinvested in certain
        foreign subsidiaries and foreign corporate joint ventures. Allowable tax credits are applied currently as reductions of the
        provision for income taxes. Interest related to unrecognized tax benefits is reflected in interest and debt expense, and penalties
        related to unrecognized tax benefits are reflected in production and operating expenses.

   •   Taxes Collected from Customers and Remitted to Governmental Authorities—Sales and value-added taxes are recorded
       net.

   •   Net Income (Loss) Per Share of Common Stock—Basic net income (loss) per share (EPS) is calculated using the two-class
       method. Under the two-class method, all earnings (distributed and undistributed) are allocated to common stock (including fully
       vested stock and unit awards that have not yet been issued as common stock) and participating securities. ConocoPhillips
       grants RSUs under its share-based compensation programs, the majority of which entitle recipients to receive non-forfeitable
       dividends during the vesting period on a basis equivalent to dividends paid to holders of the Company’s common stock. See
       Note 16. These unvested RSUs meet the definition of participating securities based on their respective rights to receive non-
       forfeitable dividends and are treated as a separate class of securities in computing basic EPS. Participating securities are not
       included as incremental shares in computing diluted EPS. Diluted EPS includes the potential impact of contingently issuable
       shares, including awards which require future service as a condition of delivery of the underlying common stock. Diluted EPS is
       calculated under both the two-class and treasury stock methods, and the more dilutive amount is reported. Diluted net loss per
       share does not assume conversion or exercise of securities as that would always have an antidilutive effect. Treasury stock is
       excluded from the daily weighted-average number of common shares outstanding in both calculations. See Note 23.

The estimated excess of current replacement cost over LIFO cost of inventories was approximately $149 million and $251 million at
December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

Note 3—Acquisitions and Dispositions
All gains or losses on asset dispositions are reported before-tax and are included net in the “Gain on dispositions” line on our
consolidated income statement. All cash proceeds and payments are included in the “Cash Flows From Investing Activities” section of
our consolidated statement of cash flows.

2022
Acquisition of Additional Shareholding Interest in Australia Pacific LNG Pty Ltd (APLNG)
In February 2022, we completed the acquisition of an additional 10 percent interest in APLNG from Origin Energy for approximately
$1.4 billion, after customary adjustments, in an all-cash transaction resulting from the exercise of our preemption right. This increased
our ownership in APLNG to 47.5 percent, with Origin Energy and Sinopec owning
27.5 percent and 25.0 percent, respectively. APLNG is reported as an equity investment in our Asia Pacific segment.

Qatar Liquefied Gas Company Limited (8) (QG8)
During 2022, we were awarded a 25 percent interest in a new joint venture (QG8) with QatarEnergy that will participate in the North
Field East (NFE) LNG project. QG8 has a 12.5 percent interest in the NFE project and is reported as an equity method investment in
our Europe, Middle East and North Africa segment. See Note 4.

Asset Acquisition
In September 2022, we completed the acquisition of an additional working interest in certain Eagle Ford acreage in the Lower 48
segment for cash consideration of $236 million after customary adjustments. This agreement was accounted for as an asset
acquisition, with the consideration allocated primarily to PP&E.

Assets Sold
During 2022, we sold our interests in certain noncore assets in our Lower 48 segment for net proceeds of $680 million, with no gain or
loss recognized on sale. At the time of disposition, our interest in these assets had a net carrying value of $680 million, consisting of
$825 million of assets, primarily related to $818 million of PP&E, and $145 million of liabilities, primarily related to AROs.

In March 2022, we completed the divestiture of our subsidiaries that held our Indonesia assets and operations, and based on an
effective date of January 1, 2021, we received net proceeds of $731 million after customary adjustments and recognized a $534 million
before-tax and $462 million after-tax gain related to this transaction. Together, the subsidiaries sold indirectly held our 54 percent
interest in the Indonesia Corridor Block Production Sharing Contract (PSC) and 35 percent shareholding in the Transasia Pipeline
Company. At the time of the disposition, the net carrying value was approximately $0.2 billion, excluding $0.2 billion of cash and
restricted cash. The net book value consisted primarily of $0.3 billion of PP&E and $0.1 billion of ARO. The before-tax earnings
associated with the subsidiaries sold, excluding the gain on disposition noted above, were $138 million and $604 million and $394
million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Results of operations for the Indonesia interests sold
were reported in our Asia Pacific segment.

In 2022, we recorded contingent payments of $451 million relating to the previous dispositions of our interest in the Foster Creek
Christina Lake Partnership and western Canada gas assets and our San Juan assets. The contingent payments are recorded as gain
on disposition on our consolidated income statement and are reflected within our Canada and Lower 48 segments. In our Canada
segment, the contingent payment, calculated and paid on a quarterly basis, is $6 million CAD for every $1 CAD by which the WCS
quarterly average crude price exceeds $52 CAD per barrel. In our Lower 48 segment, the contingent payment, paid on an annual basis,
is calculated monthly at $7 million per month in which the U.S. Henry Hub price is at or above $3.20 per MMBTU. The term of
contingent payments in our Canada segment ended in the second quarter of 2022 and continues through 2023 for the Lower 48
segment. We recorded contingent payments of $369 million in 2021. No payments were recorded in 2020.

2021
During the year, we completed the acquisitions of Concho Resources Inc. (Concho) and of Shell Enterprises LLC’s (Shell) Permian
assets. The acquisitions were accounted for as business combinations under FASB Topic ASC 805 using the acquisition method, which
requires assets acquired and liabilities assumed to be measured at their acquisition date fair values. Fair value measurements were
made for acquired assets and liabilities, and adjustments to those measurements may be made in subsequent periods, up to one year
from the acquisition date as we identify new information about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date to
consider.

Acquisition of Concho Resources Inc.
In January 2021, we completed our acquisition of Concho, an independent oil and gas exploration and production company with
operations across New Mexico and West Texas focused in the Permian-based Delaware and Midland Basins. Total consideration for
the all-stock transaction was valued at $13.1 billion, in which 1.46 shares of ConocoPhillips common stock were exchanged for each
outstanding share of Concho common stock.

Oil and gas properties were valued using a discounted cash flow approach incorporating market participant and internally generated
price assumptions; production profiles; and operating and development cost assumptions. Debt assumed in the acquisition was valued
based on observable market prices. The fair values determined for accounts receivable, accounts payable, and most other current
assets and current liabilities were equivalent to the carrying value due to their short-term nature. The total consideration of $13.1 billion
was allocated to the identifiable assets and liabilities based on their fair values as of January 15, 2021.

With the completion of the Concho transaction, we acquired proved and unproved properties of approximately $11.8 billion and $6.9
billion, respectively.

We recognized approximately $157 million of transaction-related costs, all of which were expensed in the first quarter of 2021. These
non-recurring costs related primarily to fees paid to advisors and the settlement of share-based awards for certain Concho employees
based on the terms of the Merger Agreement.

In the first quarter of 2021, we commenced a company-wide restructuring program, the scope of which included combining the
operations of the two companies as well as other global restructuring activities. We recognized non-recurring restructuring costs mainly
for employee severance and related incremental pension benefit costs.

The impact from the transaction and restructuring costs to the lines of our consolidated income statement for the year ended
December 31, 2021, are below:

recognized an additional income tax-related restructuring charge of $75 million.

Acquisition of Shell Permian Assets
In December 2021, we completed our acquisition of Shell assets in the Permian based Delaware Basin. The accounting close date
used for reporting purposes was December 31, 2021. Assets acquired include approximately 225,000 net acres and producing
properties located entirely in Texas. Total consideration for the transaction was $8.6 billion.

The unaudited supplemental pro forma financial information is presented for illustration purposes only and is not necessarily indicative
of the operating results that would have occurred had the transactions been completed on January 1, 2020, nor is it necessarily
indicative of future operating results of the combined entity. The unaudited pro forma financial information for the twelve-month period
ending December 31, 2020 is a result of combining the consolidated income statement of ConocoPhillips with the results of Concho
and the assets acquired from Shell. The pro forma results do not include transaction-related costs, nor any cost savings anticipated as
a result of the transactions. The pro forma results include adjustments from Concho’s historical results to reverse impairment expense
of $10.5 billion and $1.9 billion related to oil and gas properties and goodwill, respectively. Other adjustments made relate primarily to
DD&A, which is based on the unit-of-production method, resulting from the purchase price allocated to properties, plants and
equipment. We believe the estimates and assumptions are reasonable, and the relative effects of the transaction are properly reflected.

Assets Sold
In 2020, we completed the sale of our Australia-West asset and operations. The sales agreement entitled us to a $200 million payment
upon a final investment decision (FID) of the Barossa development project. In March 2021, FID was announced and as such, we
recognized a $200 million gain on disposition in the first quarter of 2021. The purchaser failed to pay the FID bonus when due. We have
commenced an arbitration proceeding against the purchaser to enforce our contractual right to the $200 million, plus interest accruing
from the due date. Results of operations related to this transaction are reflected in our Asia Pacific segment. See Note 11.

In the second half of 2021, we sold our interests in certain noncore assets in our Lower 48 segment for approximately $250 million after
customary adjustments, recognizing a before-tax gain on sale of approximately $58 million. We also completed the sale of our noncore
exploration interests in Argentina, recognizing a before-tax loss on disposition of $179 million. Results of operations for Argentina were
reported in our Other International segment.

2020
Asset Acquisition
In August 2020, we completed the acquisition of additional Montney acreage in Canada from Kelt Exploration Ltd. for $382 million after
customary adjustments, plus the assumption of $31 million in financing obligations associated with partially owned infrastructure. This
acquisition consisted primarily of undeveloped properties and included 140,000 net acres in the liquids-rich Inga Fireweed asset
Montney zone, which is directly adjacent to our existing Montney position. The transaction increased our Montney acreage position to
approximately 295,000 net acres with a 100 percent working interest. This agreement was accounted for as an asset acquisition
resulting in the recognition of $490 million of PP&E; $77 million of ARO and accrued environmental costs; and $31 million of financing
obligations recorded primarily to long-term debt. Results of operations for the Montney asset are reported in our Canada segment.

Assets Sold
In February 2020, we sold our Waddell Ranch interests in the Permian Basin for $184 million after customary adjustments. No gain or
loss was recognized on the sale. Results of operations for the Waddell Ranch interests sold were reported in our Lower 48 segment.

In March 2020, we completed the sale of our Niobrara interests for approximately $359 million after customary adjustments and
recognized a before-tax loss on disposition of $38 million. At the time of disposition, our interest in Niobrara had a net carrying value of
$397 million, consisting primarily of $433 million of PP&E and $34 million of ARO. The before-tax loss associated with our interests in
Niobrara, including the loss on disposition noted above, was $25 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Results of operations
for the Niobrara interests sold were reported in our Lower 48 segment.

In May 2020, we completed the divestiture of our subsidiaries that held our Australia-West assets and operations, and based on an
effective date of January 1, 2019, we received proceeds of $765 million. We recognized a before-tax gain of $587 million related to this
transaction in 2020. At the time of disposition, the net carrying value of the subsidiaries sold was approximately $0.2 billion, excluding
$0.5 billion of cash. The net carrying value consisted primarily of $1.3 billion of PP&E and $0.1 billion of other current assets offset by
$0.7 billion of ARO, $0.3 billion of deferred tax liabilities, and $0.2 billion of other liabilities. The before-tax earnings associated with the
subsidiaries sold, including the gain on disposition noted above, was $851 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The sales
agreement entitled us to an additional $200 million upon FID of the Barossa development project. Results of operations for the
subsidiaries sold were reported in our Asia Pacific segment.

Our share of income taxes incurred directly by an equity method investee is reported in equity in earnings of affiliates, and as such is
not included in income taxes on our consolidated financial statements.

At December 31, 2022, retained earnings included $42 million related to the undistributed earnings of affiliated companies. Dividends
received from affiliates were $3,045 million, $1,279 million and $1,076 million in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

APLNG
APLNG is a joint venture focused on producing CBM from the Bowen and Surat basins in Queensland, Australia. Natural gas is sold to
domestic customers and LNG is processed and exported to Asia Pacific markets. Our investment in APLNG gives us access to CBM
resources in Australia and enhances our LNG position. The majority of APLNG LNG is sold under two long-term sales and purchase
agreements, supplemented with sales of additional LNG cargoes targeting the Asia Pacific markets. Origin Energy, an integrated
Australian energy company, is the operator of APLNG’s production and pipeline system, while we operate the LNG facility.

In 2012, APLNG executed an $8.5 billion project finance facility that became non-recourse following financial completion in 2017. The
facility is currently composed of a financing agreement with the Export-Import Bank of the United States, a commercial bank facility and
two United States Private Placement note facilities. APLNG principal and interest payments commenced in March 2017 and are
scheduled to occur bi-annually until September 2030. At December 31, 2022, a balance of $5.2 billion was outstanding on the facilities.
See Note 10.

During the fourth quarter of 2021, Origin Energy Limited agreed to the sale of 10 percent of their interest in APLNG for $1.645 billion,
before customary adjustments. ConocoPhillips announced in December 2021 that we were exercising our preemption right under the
APLNG Shareholders Agreement to purchase an additional 10 percent shareholding interest in APLNG, subject to government
approvals. The sales price associated with this preemption right was determined to reflect a relevant observable market participant view
of APLNG’s fair value which was below the carrying value of our existing investment in APLNG. Based on a review of the facts and
circumstances surrounding this decline in fair value, we concluded in the fourth quarter of 2021 the impairment was other than
temporary under the guidance of FASB ASC Topic 323, and the recognition of an impairment of our existing investment was necessary.
Accordingly, we recorded a noncash $688 million before-tax and after-tax impairment in the fourth quarter of 2021. The impairment was
included in the “Impairments” line on our consolidated income statement. See Note 7.

At December 31, 2022, the carrying value of our equity method investment in APLNG was approximately $6.2 billion. The historical cost
basis of our 47.5 percent share of net assets of APLNG was $6.1 billion, resulting in a basis difference of $41 million on our books. The
basis difference, which is substantially all associated with PP&E and subject to amortization, has been allocated on a relative fair value
basis to individual production license areas owned by APLNG. Any future additional payments are expected to be allocated in a similar
manner. As the joint venture produces natural gas from each license, we amortize the basis difference allocated to that license using
the unit-of-production method. Included in net income (loss) attributable to ConocoPhillips for 2022, 2021 and 2020 was after-tax
expense of $10 million, $39 million and $41 million, respectively, representing the amortization of this basis difference on currently
producing licenses.

QG3
QG3 is a joint venture that owns an integrated large-scale LNG project located in Qatar. We provided project financing, which was fully
repaid in the third quarter of 2022, as described below under “Loans.” At December 31, 2022, the book value of our equity method
investment in QG3 was approximately $0.7 billion. We have terminal and pipeline use agreements with Golden Pass LNG Terminal and
affiliated Golden Pass Pipeline near Sabine Pass, Texas, intended to provide us with terminal and pipeline capacity for the receipt,
storage and regasification of LNG purchased from QG3. Currently, the LNG from QG3 is being sold to markets outside of the U.S.

QG8
During 2022, we were awarded a 25 percent interest in a new joint venture (QG8) with QatarEnergy that will participate in the NFE LNG
project. QG8 has a 12.5 percent interest in the NFE project. At December 31, 2022, the book value of our equity method investment
was approximately $0.3 billion. See Note 3.

Loans
As part of our normal ongoing business operations and consistent with industry practice, we enter into numerous agreements with other
parties to pursue business opportunities. Included in such activity are loans to certain affiliated and non-affiliated companies.

At December 31, 2022, there were no outstanding loans to affiliated companies as the final loan payment related to QG3 project
financing was received in the third quarter of 2022. QG3 secured project financing of $4.0 billion in December 2005, consisting of $1.3
billion of loans from export credit agencies (ECA), $1.5 billion from commercial banks and $1.2 billion from ConocoPhillips. The
ConocoPhillips loan facilities had substantially the same terms as the ECA and commercial bank facilities. On December 15, 2011,
QG3 achieved financial completion and all project loan facilities became nonrecourse to the project participants. Semi-annual
repayments began in January 2011 and were completed in July 2022, for all loan arrangements.

Note 5—Investment in Cenovus Energy
At December 31, 2021, we held 91 million common shares of Cenovus Energy (CVE), which approximated 4.5 percent of the issued
and outstanding common shares of CVE. Those shares were carried on our balance sheet at fair value of $1.1 billion based on NYSE
closing price of $12.28 per share on the last day of trading for the period. During the first quarter of 2022, we sold our remaining 91
million shares, recognizing proceeds of $1.4 billion.


All gains and losses were recognized within "Other income (loss)" on our consolidated income statement. Proceeds related to the sale
of our CVE shares were included within "Cash Flows from Investing Activities" on our consolidated statement of cash flows. See Note
13.

Exploration Expenses
The charges discussed below are included in the “Exploration expenses” line on our consolidated income statement.

2022
In the fourth quarter, we recorded a before-tax expense of $129 million for impairment of certain aged, suspended wells associated with
Surmont in our Canada segment.

In our Europe, Middle East and North Africa segment, we recorded a before-tax expense of $102 million for dry hole costs associated
with four operated exploration and appraisal wells and one partner operated well that were drilled in Norway in 2022.

2020
In our Alaska segment, we recorded a before-tax impairment of $828 million for the entire associated carrying value of capitalized
undeveloped leasehold costs related to our Alaska North Slope Gas asset. We had stopped participating in evaluating gas line projects
and did not believe a project would advance. We remain willing to sell our Alaska North Slope gas to interested parties on a competitive
basis if a market materializes in the future.

In our Other International segment, our interests in the Middle Magdalena Basin of Colombia are in force majeure. Because we had no
immediate plans to perform under existing contracts, in 2020, we recorded a before-tax expense totaling $84 million for dry hole costs
of a previously suspended well and an impairment of the associated capitalized undeveloped leasehold carrying value.

In our Asia Pacific segment, we recorded before-tax expense of $50 million related to dry hole costs of a previously suspended well and
an impairment of the associated capitalized undeveloped leasehold carrying value associated with the Kamunsu East Field in Malaysia
that is no longer in our development plans.

2021
We recorded an impairment of $688 million on our APLNG investment included within the Asia Pacific segment. See Note 4 and Note
13.

In our Lower 48 segment, we recorded a credit to impairment of $89 million due to a decreased ARO estimate for a previously sold
asset, in which we retained the ARO liability. This was offset by recorded impairments of $84 million during the fourth quarter of 2021,
related to certain noncore assets due to changes in development plans. See Note 13.

In our Europe, Middle East and North Africa segment, we recorded a credit to impairment of $24 million due to decreased ARO
estimates on fields in Norway which ceased production and were fully depreciated in prior years.

2020
We recorded impairments of $813 million, primarily related to certain noncore assets in the Lower 48. Due to a significant decrease in
the outlook for current and long-term natural gas prices in early 2020, we recorded impairments of $523 million, primarily for the Wind
River Basin operations area, consisting of developed properties in the Madden Field and the Lost Cabin Gas Plant, in the first quarter of
2020. Additionally, due primarily to changes in development plans solidified in the last quarter of 2020, we recognized additional
impairments of $287 million in the Lower 48 during the fourth quarter.

*Classified as a current liability on the balance sheet under “Other accruals.”
Asset Retirement Obligations
We record the fair value of a liability for an ARO when it is incurred (typically when the asset is installed at the production location).
When the liability is initially recorded, we capitalize the associated asset retirement cost by increasing the carrying amount of the
related PP&E. Over time, the liability increases for the change in its present value, while the capitalized cost depreciates over the useful
life of the related asset. If, in subsequent periods, our estimate of this liability changes, we will record an adjustment to both the liability
and PP&E. Reductions to estimated liabilities for assets that are no longer producing are recorded as a credit to impairment.
We have numerous AROs we are required to perform under law or contract once an asset is permanently taken out of service. Most of
these obligations are not expected to be paid until several years, or decades, in the future and will be funded from general company
resources at the time of removal. Our largest individual obligations involve plugging and abandonment of wells and removal and
disposal of offshore oil and gas platforms around the world, as well as oil and gas production facilities and pipelines in Alaska.
During 2022 and 2021, our overall ARO changed as follows:
                                                                                                                     Millions of Dollars

Accrued Environmental Costs
Total accrued environmental costs at December 31, 2022 and 2021, were $182 million and $187 million, respectively.

We had accrued environmental costs of $107 million and $135 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, related to
remediation activities in the U.S. and Canada. We had also accrued in Corporate and Other $59 million and $36 million of
environmental costs associated with sites no longer in operation at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. In addition, both
December 31, 2022 and 2021, included a $16 million accrual, where the company has been named a potentially responsible party
under the Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, or similar state laws. Accrued
environmental liabilities are expected to be paid over periods extending up to 30 years.

Expected expenditures for environmental obligations acquired in various business combinations are discounted using a weighted-
average 5 percent discount factor, resulting in an accrued balance for acquired environmental liabilities of $111 million at December 31,
2022. The total expected future undiscounted payments related to the portion of the accrued environmental costs that have been
discounted are $147 million.

In December 2022, the company retired $329 million principal amount of our 2.40 percent Notes at the natural maturity date. In May
2022, we redeemed $1,250 million principal amount of our 4.95 percent Notes due 2026. We paid premiums above face value of $79
million to redeem the debt and recognized a loss on debt extinguishment of $83 million which is included in the "Other expenses" line
on our consolidated income statement. We also paid $500 million to retire the outstanding principal amount of the floating rate notes
due 2022 at maturity.

In the first quarter of 2022, we completed a debt refinancing consisting of three concurrent transactions: a tender offer to repurchase
existing debt for cash; exchange offers to retire certain debt in exchange for new debt and cash; and a new debt issuance to partially
fund the cash paid in the tender and exchange offers.

Tender Offer
In March 2022, we repurchased a total of $2,716 million aggregate principal amount of debt as listed below. We paid premiums above
face value of $333 million to repurchase these debt instruments and recognized a gain on debt extinguishment of $155 million which is
included in the "Other expenses" line on our consolidated income statement.

     •   3.75% Notes due 2027 with principal of $1,000 million (partial repurchase of $804 million)
     •   4.3% Notes due 2028 with principal of $1,000 million (partial repurchase of $777 million)
     •   2.4% Notes due 2031 with principal of $500 million (partial repurchase of $273 million)
     •   4.875% Notes due 2047 with principal of $800 million (partial repurchase of $481 million)
     •   4.85% Notes due 2048 with principal of $600 million (partial repurchase of $381 million)

Exchange Offers
Also in March 2022, we completed two concurrent debt exchange offers through which $2,544 million of aggregate principal of existing
notes was tendered and accepted in exchange for a combination of new notes and cash. The debt exchange offers were treated as
debt modifications for accounting purposes resulting in a portion of the unamortized debt discount, premiums and debt issuance costs
of the existing notes being allocated to the new notes on the settlement dates of the exchange offers. We paid premiums above face
value of $883 million, comprised of $872 million of cash as well as new notes, which were capitalized as additional debt discount. We
incurred expenses of $28 million in the exchanges which are included in the "Other expenses" line on our consolidated income
statement.

The notes tendered and accepted in the exchange offers were:
   • 7.0% Debentures due 2029 with principal amount of $200 million (partial exchange of $88 million)

The notes tendered and accepted were exchanged for the following new notes:
   • 3.758% Notes due 2042 with principal amount of $785 million
   • 4.025% Notes due 2062 with principal amount of $1,770 million

New Debt Issuance
In March 2022, we issued the following new notes consisting of:
    • 2.125% Notes due 2024 with principal of $900 million
    • 2.4% Note due 2025 with principal of $900 million
    • 3.8% Note due 2052 with principal of $1,100 million

In February 2022, we refinanced our revolving credit facility from a total borrowing capacity of $6.0 billion to $5.5 billion with an
expiration date of February 2027. Our revolving credit facility may be used for direct bank borrowings, the issuance of letters of credit
totaling up to $500 million, or as support for our commercial paper program. The revolving credit facility is broadly syndicated among
financial institutions and does not contain any material adverse change provisions or any covenants requiring maintenance of specified
financial ratios or credit ratings. The facility agreement contains a cross-default provision relating to the failure to pay principal or
interest on other debt obligations of $200 million or more by ConocoPhillips, or any of its consolidated subsidiaries. The amount of the
facility is not subject to redetermination prior to its expiration date.

Credit facility borrowings may bear interest at a margin above the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR). The facility agreement
calls for commitment fees on available, but unused, amounts. The facility agreement also contains early termination rights if our current
directors or their approved successors cease to be a majority of the Board of Directors.

The revolving credit facility supports our ability to issue up to $5.5 billion of commercial paper. Commercial paper is generally limited to
maturities of 90 days and is included in short-term debt on our consolidated balance sheet. With no commercial paper outstanding and
no direct borrowings or letters of credit, we had access to $5.5 billion in available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility at
December 31, 2022. At December 31, 2021, we had no commercial paper outstanding and no direct borrowings or letters of credit
issued.

In January 2021, we completed the acquisition of Concho in an all-stock transaction. In the acquisition, we assumed Concho’s publicly
traded debt, with an outstanding principal balance of $3.9 billion, which was recorded at fair value of $4.7 billion on the acquisition date.
The adjustment to fair value of the senior notes of approximately $0.8 billion on the acquisition date will be amortized as an adjustment
to interest expense over the remaining contractual terms of the senior notes.

In February 2021, we completed a debt exchange offer related to the debt assumed from Concho. Of the approximately $3.9 billion in
aggregate principal amount of Concho’s senior notes offered in the exchange, 98 percent, or approximately $3.8 billion, was tendered
and accepted. The new debt issued by ConocoPhillips had the same interest rates and maturity dates as the Concho senior notes. The
portion not exchanged, approximately $67 million, remained outstanding across five series of senior notes issued by Concho. The debt
exchange was treated as a debt modification for accounting purposes resulting in a portion of the unamortized fair value adjustment of
the Concho senior notes allocated to the new debt issued by ConocoPhillips on the settlement date of the exchange. The new debt
issued in the exchange is fully and unconditionally guaranteed by ConocoPhillips Company. See Note 3.

For information on Finance Leases, see Note 15.

The current credit ratings on our long-term debt are:
   • Fitch: “A” with a “stable” outlook
   • S&P: “A-” with a “stable” outlook
   • Moody's: "A2" with a "stable" outlook

We do not have any ratings triggers on any of our corporate debt that would cause an automatic default, and thereby impact our access
to liquidity upon downgrade of our credit ratings. If our credit ratings are downgraded from their current levels, it could increase the cost
of corporate debt available to us and restrict our access to the commercial paper markets. If our credit ratings were to deteriorate to a
level prohibiting us from accessing the commercial paper market, we would still be able to access funds under our revolving credit
facility.

At both December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had $283 million of certain variable rate demand bonds (VRDBs) outstanding with maturities
ranging through 2035. The VRDBs are redeemable at the option of the bondholders on any business day. If they are ever redeemed,
we have the ability and intent to refinance on a long-term basis, therefore, the VRDBs are included in the “Long-term debt” line on our
consolidated balance sheet.

Note 10—Guarantees
At December 31, 2022, we were liable for certain contingent obligations under various contractual arrangements as described below.
We recognize a liability, at inception, for the fair value of our obligation as a guarantor for newly issued or modified guarantees. Unless
the carrying amount of the liability is noted below, we have not recognized a liability because the fair value of the obligation is
immaterial. In addition, unless otherwise stated, we are not currently performing with any significance under the guarantee and expect
future performance to be either immaterial or have only a remote chance of occurrence.

APLNG Guarantees
At December 31, 2022, we had outstanding multiple guarantees in connection with our 47.5 percent ownership interest in APLNG. The
following is a description of the guarantees with values calculated utilizing December 2022 exchange rates:

     •   During the third quarter of 2016, we issued a guarantee to facilitate the withdrawal of our pro-rata portion of the funds in a
         project finance reserve account. We estimate the remaining term of this guarantee to be eight years. Our maximum exposure
         under this guarantee is approximately $210 million and may become payable if an enforcement action is commenced by the
         project finance lenders against APLNG. At December 31, 2022, the carrying value of this guarantee was approximately $14
         million.

     •   In conjunction with our original purchase of an ownership interest in APLNG from Origin Energy Limited in October 2008, we
          agreed to reimburse Origin Energy Limited for our share of the existing contingent liability arising under guarantees of an
          existing obligation of APLNG to deliver natural gas under several sales agreements. The final guarantee expires in the fourth
          quarter of 2041. Our maximum potential liability for future payments, or cost of volume delivery, under these guarantees is
          estimated to be $780 million ($1.3 billion in the event of intentional or reckless breach) and would become payable if APLNG
          fails to meet its obligations under these agreements and the obligations cannot otherwise be mitigated. Future payments are
          considered unlikely, as the payments, or cost of volume delivery, would only be triggered if APLNG does not have enough
          natural gas to meet these sales commitments and if the co-ventures do not make necessary equity contributions into APLNG.

     •   We have guaranteed the performance of APLNG with regard to certain other contracts executed in connection with the project’s
         continued development. The guarantees have remaining terms of 14 to 23 years or the life of the venture. Our maximum
         potential amount of future payments related to these guarantees is approximately $290 million and would become payable if
         APLNG does not perform. At December 31, 2022, the carrying value of these guarantees was approximately $20 million.

QG8 Guarantee
We have guaranteed our portion of certain fiscal and other joint venture obligations as a shareholder in QG8. This guarantee has an
approximate 30-year term with no maximum limit. At December 31, 2022, the carrying value of this guarantee was approximately $7
million.

Other Guarantees
We have other guarantees with maximum future potential payment amounts totaling approximately $600 million, which consist primarily
of guarantees of the residual value of leased office buildings and guarantees of the residual value of corporate aircraft. These
guarantees have remaining terms of three to four years and would become payable if certain asset values are lower than guaranteed
amounts at the end of the lease or contract term, business conditions decline at guaranteed entities, or as a result of nonperformance
of contractual terms by guaranteed parties. At December 31, 2022, there was no carrying value associated with these guarantees.

Indemnifications
Over the years, we have entered into agreements to sell ownership interests in certain legal entities, joint ventures and assets that gave
rise to qualifying indemnifications. These agreements include indemnifications for taxes and environmental liabilities. The carrying
amount recorded for these indemnifications at December 31, 2022, was approximately $20 million. Those related to environmental
issues have terms that are generally indefinite and the maximum amounts of future payments are generally unlimited. Although it is
reasonably possible future payments may exceed amounts recorded, due to the nature of the indemnifications, it is not possible to
make a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential amount of future payments. See Note 11 for additional information about
environmental liabilities.

Note 11—Contingencies and Commitments
A number of lawsuits involving a variety of claims arising in the ordinary course of business have been filed against ConocoPhillips. We
also may be required to remove or mitigate the effects on the environment of the placement, storage, disposal or release of certain
chemical, mineral and petroleum substances at various active and inactive sites. We regularly assess the need for accounting
recognition or disclosure of these contingencies. In the case of all known contingencies (other than those related to income taxes), we
accrue a liability when the loss is probable and the amount is reasonably estimable. If a range of amounts can be reasonably estimated
and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount, then the low end of the range is accrued. We do not reduce
these liabilities for potential insurance or third-party recoveries. We accrue receivables for insurance or other third-party recoveries
when applicable. With respect to income tax-related contingencies, we use a cumulative probability-weighted loss accrual in cases
where sustaining a tax position is less than certain. See Note 17, for additional information about income tax-related contingencies.

Based on currently available information, we believe it is remote that future costs related to known contingent liability exposures will
exceed current accruals by an amount that would have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements. As we learn
new facts concerning contingencies, we reassess our position both with respect to accrued liabilities and other potential exposures.
Estimates particularly sensitive to future changes include contingent liabilities recorded for environmental remediation, tax and legal
matters. Estimated future environmental remediation costs are subject to change due to such factors as the uncertain magnitude of
cleanup costs, the unknown time and extent of such remedial actions that may be required, and the determination of our liability in
proportion to that of other responsible parties. Estimated future costs related to tax and legal matters are subject to change as events
evolve and as additional information becomes available during the administrative and litigation processes.

Environmental
We are subject to international, federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations and record accruals for environmental
liabilities based on management’s best estimates. These estimates are based on currently available facts, existing technology, and
presently enacted laws and regulations, taking into account stakeholder and business considerations. When measuring environmental
liabilities, we also consider our prior experience in remediation of contaminated sites, other companies’ cleanup experience, and data
released by the U.S. EPA or other organizations. We consider unasserted claims in our determination of environmental liabilities, and
we accrue them in the period they are both probable and reasonably estimable.

Although liability of those potentially responsible for environmental remediation costs is generally joint and several for federal sites and
frequently so for other sites, we are usually only one of many companies cited at a particular site. Due to the joint and several liabilities,
we could be responsible for all cleanup costs related to any site at which we have been designated as a potentially responsible party.
We have been successful to date in sharing cleanup costs with other financially sound companies. Many of the sites at which we are
potentially responsible are still under investigation by the EPA or the agency concerned. Prior to actual cleanup, those potentially
responsible normally assess the site conditions, apportion responsibility and determine the appropriate remediation. In some instances,
we may have no liability or may attain a settlement of liability. Where it appears that other potentially responsible parties may be
financially unable to bear their proportional share, we consider this inability in estimating our potential liability, and we adjust our
accruals accordingly. As a result of various acquisitions in the past, we assumed certain environmental obligations. Some of these
environmental obligations are mitigated by indemnifications made by others for our benefit, and some of the indemnifications are
subject to dollar limits and time limits.

We are currently participating in environmental assessments and cleanups at numerous federal Superfund and comparable state and
international sites. After an assessment of environmental exposures for cleanup and other costs, we make accruals on an undiscounted
basis (except those acquired in a purchase business combination, which we record on a discounted basis) for planned investigation
and remediation activities for sites where it is probable future costs will be incurred and these costs can be reasonably estimated. We
have not reduced these accruals for possible insurance recoveries. In the future, we may be involved in additional environmental
assessments, cleanups and proceedings.
See Note 8 for a summary of our accrued environmental liabilities.

Litigation and Other Contingencies
We are subject to various lawsuits and claims including but not limited to matters involving oil and gas royalty and severance tax
payments, gas measurement and valuation methods, contract disputes, environmental damages, climate change, personal injury, and
property damage. Our primary exposures for such matters relate to alleged royalty and tax underpayments on certain federal, state and
privately owned properties, claims of alleged environmental contamination and damages from historic operations, and climate change.
We will continue to defend ourselves vigorously in these matters.

Our legal organization applies its knowledge, experience and professional judgment to the specific characteristics of our cases,
employing a litigation management process to manage and monitor the legal proceedings against us. Our process facilitates the early
evaluation and quantification of potential exposures in individual cases. This process also enables us to track those cases that have
been scheduled for trial and/or mediation. Based on professional judgment and experience in using these litigation management tools
and available information about current developments in all our cases, our legal organization regularly assesses the adequacy of
current accruals and determines if adjustment of existing accruals, or establishment of new accruals, is required.

We have contingent liabilities resulting from throughput agreements with pipeline and processing companies not associated with
financing arrangements. Under these agreements, we may be required to provide any such company with additional funds through
advances and penalties for fees related to throughput capacity not utilized. In addition, at December 31, 2022, we had performance
obligations secured by letters of credit of $368 million (issued as direct bank letters of credit) related to various purchase commitments
for materials, supplies, commercial activities and services incident to the ordinary conduct of business.

In 2007, ConocoPhillips was unable to reach agreement with respect to the empresa mixta structure mandated by the Venezuelan
government’s Nationalization Decree. As a result, Venezuela’s national oil company, Petróleos de Venezuela, S.A. (PDVSA), or its
affiliates, directly assumed control over ConocoPhillips’ interests in the Petrozuata and Hamaca heavy oil ventures and the offshore
Corocoro development project. In response to this expropriation, ConocoPhillips initiated international arbitration on November 2, 2007,
with the ICSID. On September 3, 2013, an ICSID arbitration tribunal held that Venezuela unlawfully expropriated ConocoPhillips’
significant oil investments in June 2007. On January 17, 2017, the Tribunal reconfirmed the decision that the expropriation was
unlawful. In March 2019, the Tribunal unanimously ordered the government of Venezuela to pay ConocoPhillips approximately $8.7
billion in compensation for the government’s unlawful expropriation of the company’s investments in Venezuela in 2007. On August 29,
2019, the ICSID Tribunal issued a decision rectifying the award and reducing it by approximately $227 million. The award now stands at
$8.5 billion plus interest. The government of Venezuela sought annulment of the award, which automatically stayed enforcement of the
award. On September 29, 2021, the ICSID annulment committee lifted the stay of enforcement of the award. The annulment
proceedings are underway.

In 2014, ConocoPhillips filed a separate and independent arbitration under the rules of the ICC against PDVSA under the contracts that
had established the Petrozuata and Hamaca projects. The ICC Tribunal issued an award in April 2018, finding that PDVSA owed
ConocoPhillips approximately $2 billion under their agreements in connection with the expropriation of the projects and other pre-
expropriation fiscal measures. In August 2018, ConocoPhillips entered into a settlement with PDVSA to recover the full amount of this
ICC award, plus interest through the payment period, including initial payments totaling approximately $500 million within a period of 90
days from the time of signing of the settlement agreement. The balance of the settlement is to be paid quarterly over a period of four
and a half years. Per the settlement, PDVSA recognized the ICC award as a judgment in various jurisdictions, and ConocoPhillips
agreed to suspend its legal enforcement actions. ConocoPhillips sent notices of default to PDVSA on October 14 and November 12,
2019, and to date PDVSA has failed to cure its breach. As a result, ConocoPhillips has resumed legal enforcement actions. To date,
ConocoPhillips has received approximately $774 million in connection with the ICC award. ConocoPhillips has ensured that the
settlement and any actions taken in enforcement thereof meet all appropriate U.S. regulatory requirements, including those related to
any applicable sanctions imposed by the U.S. against Venezuela.

In 2016, ConocoPhillips filed a separate and independent arbitration under the rules of the ICC against PDVSA under the contracts that
had established the Corocoro Project. On August 2, 2019, the ICC Tribunal awarded ConocoPhillips approximately $33 million plus
interest under the Corocoro contracts. ConocoPhillips is seeking recognition and enforcement of the award in various jurisdictions.
ConocoPhillips has ensured that all the actions related to the award meet all appropriate U.S. regulatory requirements, including those
related to any applicable sanctions imposed by the U.S. against Venezuela.

Beginning in 2017, governmental and other entities in several states/territories in the U.S. have filed lawsuits against oil and gas
companies, including ConocoPhillips, seeking compensatory damages and equitable relief to abate alleged climate change impacts.
Additional lawsuits with similar allegations are expected to be filed. The amounts claimed by plaintiffs are unspecified and the legal and
factual issues are unprecedented, therefore, there is significant uncertainty about the scope of the claims and alleged damages and any
potential impact on the Company’s financial condition. ConocoPhillips believes these lawsuits are factually and legally meritless and are
an inappropriate vehicle to address the challenges associated with climate change and will vigorously defend against such lawsuits.

Several Louisiana parishes and the State of Louisiana have filed 43 lawsuits under Louisiana’s State and Local Coastal Resources
Management Act (SLCRMA) against oil and gas companies, including ConocoPhillips, seeking compensatory damages for
contamination and erosion of the Louisiana coastline allegedly caused by historical oil and gas operations. ConocoPhillips entities are
defendants in 22 of the lawsuits and will vigorously defend against them. On October 17, 2022, the Fifth Circuit affirmed remand of lead
cases to state court and the subsequent request for rehearing was denied. Accordingly, the federal district courts have issued remands
to state court. Because Plaintiffs’ SLCRMA theories are unprecedented, there is uncertainty about these claims (both as to scope and
damages) and we continue to evaluate our exposure in these lawsuits.

In October 2020, the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE) ordered the prior owners of Outer Continental Shelf
(OCS) Lease P-0166, including ConocoPhillips, to decommission the lease facilities, including two offshore platforms located near
Carpinteria, California. This order was sent after the current owner of OCS Lease P-0166 relinquished the lease and abandoned the
lease platforms and facilities. BSEE’s order to ConocoPhillips is premised on its connection to Phillips Petroleum Company, a legacy
company of ConocoPhillips, which held a historical 25 percent interest in this lease and operated these facilities, but sold its interest
approximately 30 years ago. ConocoPhillips continues to evaluate its exposure in this matter.

On May 10, 2021, ConocoPhillips filed arbitration under the rules of the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC) against
Santos KOTN Pty Ltd. and Santos Limited for their failure to timely pay the $200 million bonus due upon FID of the Barossa
development project under the sale and purchase agreement. Santos KOTN Pty Ltd. and Santos Limited have filed a response and
counterclaim, and the arbitration is underway.

In July 2021, a federal securities class action was filed against Concho, certain of Concho’s officers, and ConocoPhillips as Concho’s
successor in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas. On October 21, 2021, the court issued an order
appointing Utah Retirement Systems and the Construction Laborers Pension Trust for Southern California as lead plaintiffs (Lead
Plaintiffs). On January 7, 2022, the Lead Plaintiffs filed their consolidated complaint alleging that Concho made materially false and
misleading statements regarding its business and operations in violation of the federal securities laws and seeking unspecified
damages, attorneys’ fees, costs, equitable/injunctive relief, and such other relief that may be deemed appropriate. We believe the
allegations in the action are without merit and are vigorously defending this litigation.

Long-Term Throughput Agreements and Take-or-Pay Agreements
We have certain throughput agreements and take-or-pay agreements in support of financing arrangements. The agreements typically
provide for natural gas or crude oil transportation to be used in the ordinary course of business. The aggregate amounts of estimated
payments under these various agreements are: 2023—$7 million; 2024—$7 million; 2025—$7 million; 2026—$7 million; 2027—$7
million; and 2028 and after—$33 million. Total payments under the agreements were $26 million in 2022, $27 million in 2021 and $25
million in 2020.

Commodity Derivative Instruments
Our commodity business primarily consists of natural gas, crude oil, bitumen, LNG and NGLs.

Commodity derivative instruments are held at fair value on our consolidated balance sheet. Where these balances have the right of
setoff, they are presented on a net basis. Related cash flows are recorded as operating activities on our consolidated statement of cash
flows. On our consolidated income statement, gains and losses are recognized either on a gross basis if directly related to our physical
business or a net basis if held for trading. Gains and losses related to contracts that meet and are designated with the NPNS exception
are recognized upon settlement. We generally apply this exception to eligible crude contracts and certain gas contracts. We do not
apply hedge accounting for our commodity derivatives.

The following table presents the gross fair values of our commodity derivatives, excluding collateral, and the line items where they
appear on our consolidated balance sheet:

On January 15, 2021, we assumed financial derivative instruments consisting of oil and natural gas swaps in connection with the
acquisition of Concho. At the acquisition date, these financial derivative instruments acquired were recognized at fair value as a net
liability of $456 million with settlement dates under the contracts through December 31, 2022. During 2021, we recognized a loss on
settlement of these derivatives contracts of $305 million. This loss is recorded within the “Sales and other operating revenues” line on
our consolidated income statement. In connection with the settlement, we issued a cash payment of $761 million during 2021 which is
included within “Cash Flows From Operating Activities” on our consolidated statement of cash flows.

As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, total unrealized losses for debt securities classified as available for sale with net losses were $12
million and negligible, respectively. No allowance for credit losses has been recorded on investments in debt securities which are in an
unrealized loss position.

For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, proceeds from sales and redemptions of investments in debt securities classified as
available for sale were $644 million and $594 million, respectively. Gross realized gains and losses included in earnings from those
sales and redemptions were negligible. The cost of securities sold and redeemed is determined using the specific identification method.

Credit Risk
Financial instruments potentially exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents, short-term investments,
long-term investments in debt securities, OTC derivative contracts and trade receivables. Our cash equivalents and short-term
investments are placed in high-quality commercial paper, government money market funds, U.S. government and government agency
obligations, time deposits with major international banks and financial institutions, high-quality corporate bonds, foreign government
obligations and asset-backed securities. Our long-term investments in debt securities are placed in high-quality corporate bonds, asset-
backed securities, U.S. government and government agency obligations, foreign government obligations, and time deposits with major
international banks and financial institutions.

The credit risk from our OTC derivative contracts, such as forwards, swaps and options, derives from the counterparty to the
transaction. Individual counterparty exposure is managed within predetermined credit limits and includes the use of cash-call margins
when appropriate, thereby reducing the risk of significant nonperformance. We also use futures, swaps and option contracts that have a
negligible credit risk because these trades are cleared primarily with an exchange clearinghouse and subject to mandatory margin
requirements until settled; however, we are exposed to the credit risk of those exchange brokers for receivables arising from daily
margin cash calls, as well as for cash deposited to meet initial margin requirements.

Our trade receivables result primarily from our petroleum operations and reflect a broad national and international customer base,
which limits our exposure to concentrations of credit risk. The majority of these receivables have payment terms of 30 days or less, and
we continually monitor this exposure and the creditworthiness of the counterparties. We may require collateral to limit the exposure to
loss including, letters of credit, prepayments and surety bonds, as well as master netting arrangements to mitigate credit risk with
counterparties that both buy from and sell to us, as these agreements permit the amounts owed by us or owed to others to be offset
against amounts due to us.

Certain of our derivative instruments contain provisions that require us to post collateral if the derivative exposure exceeds a threshold
amount. We have contracts with fixed threshold amounts and other contracts with variable threshold amounts that are contingent on our
credit rating. The variable threshold amounts typically decline for lower credit ratings, while both the variable and fixed threshold
amounts typically revert to zero if we fall below investment grade. Cash is the primary collateral in all contracts; however, many also
permit us to post letters of credit as collateral, such as transactions administered through the New York Mercantile Exchange.

The aggregate fair value of all derivative instruments with such credit risk-related contingent features that were in a liability position on
December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, was $333 million and $281 million, respectively. For these instruments, $42 million of
collateral was posted as of December 31, 2022 and no collateral was posted as of December 31, 2021. If our credit rating had been
downgraded below investment grade on December 31, 2022, we would have been required to post $270 million of additional collateral,
either with cash or letters of credit.

Note 13—Fair Value Measurement
We carry a portion of our assets and liabilities at fair value that are measured at the reporting date using an exit price (i.e., the price that
would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability) and disclosed according to the quality of valuation inputs under the fair
value hierarchy.

The classification of an asset or liability is based on the lowest level of input significant to its fair value. Those that are initially classified
as Level 3 are subsequently reported as Level 2 when the fair value derived from unobservable inputs is inconsequential to the overall
fair value, or if corroborated market data becomes available. Assets and liabilities initially reported as Level 2 are subsequently reported
as Level 3 if corroborated market data is no longer available. There were no material transfers into or out of Level 3 during 2022 or
2021.

Recurring Fair Value Measurement
Financial assets and liabilities reported at fair value on a recurring basis primarily include our investment in CVE common shares, our
investments in debt securities classified as available for sale, and commodity derivatives.
• Level 1 derivative assets and liabilities primarily represent exchange-traded futures and options that are valued using unadjusted
    prices available from the underlying exchange. Level 1 also includes our investment in common shares of CVE, which is valued
    using quotes for shares on the NYSE, and our investments in U.S. government obligations classified as available for sale debt
    securities, which are valued using exchange prices.
• Level 2 derivative assets and liabilities primarily represent OTC swaps, options and forward purchase and sale contracts that are
    valued using adjusted exchange prices, prices provided by brokers or pricing service companies that are all corroborated by market
    data. Level 2 also includes our investments in debt securities classified as available for sale including investments in corporate
    bonds, commercial paper, asset-backed securities, U.S. government agency obligations and foreign government obligations that
    are valued using pricing provided by brokers or pricing service companies that are corroborated with market data.
• Level 3 derivative assets and liabilities consist of OTC swaps, options and forward purchase and sale contracts where a significant
    portion of fair value is calculated from underlying market data that is not readily available. The derived value uses industry standard
    methodologies that may consider the historical relationships among various commodities, modeled market prices, time value,
    volatility factors and other relevant economic measures. The use of these inputs results in management’s best estimate of fair
    value. Level 3 activity was not material for all periods presented.

During 2021, the estimated fair value of certain noncore assets included in our Lower 48 segment declined to amounts below the
carrying values. The carrying values were written down to fair value. The fair values were estimated based on internal discounted cash
flow models using the following estimated assumptions: estimated future production, an outlook of future prices from a combination of
exchanges (short-term) coupled with pricing service companies and our internal outlook (long-term), future operating costs and capital
expenditures, and a discount rate believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants. The range and arithmetic
average of significant unobservable inputs used in the Level 3 fair value measurements for significant assets were as follows:

Equity Method Investments
During the fourth quarter of 2021, Origin Energy Limited agreed to the sale of 10 percent of their interest in APLNG for $1.645 billion,
before customary adjustments. ConocoPhillips announced in December 2021 that we were exercising our preemption right under the
APLNG Shareholders Agreement to purchase an additional 10 percent shareholding interest in APLNG, subject to government
approvals. The sales price associated with this preemption right was determined to reflect a relevant observable market participant view
of APLNG’s fair value which was below the carrying value of our existing investment in APLNG. As such, our investment in APLNG was
written down to its fair value of $5,574 million, resulting in a before-tax charge of $688 million. See Note 4 and Note 7.

Reported Fair Values of Financial Instruments
We used the following methods and assumptions to estimate the fair value of financial instruments:
   • Cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments: The carrying amount reported on the balance sheet approximates fair
       value. For those investments classified as available for sale debt securities, the carrying amount reported on the balance sheet
       is fair value.
   • Accounts and notes receivable (including long-term and related parties): The carrying amount reported on the balance sheet
       approximates fair value. The valuation technique and methods used to estimate the fair value of the current portion of fixed-rate
       related party loans is consistent with Loans and advances—related parties.
   • Investment in Cenovus Energy: See Note 5 for a discussion of the carrying value and fair value of our investment in CVE
       common shares.
   • Investments in debt securities classified as available for sale: The fair value of investments in debt securities categorized as
       Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy is measured using exchange prices. The fair value of investments in debt securities
       categorized as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy is measured using pricing provided by brokers or pricing service companies
       that are corroborated with market data. See Note 12.
   • Loans and advances—related parties: The carrying amount of floating-rate loans approximates fair value. The fair value of
       fixed-rate loan activity is measured using market observable data and is categorized as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. See
       Note 4.
   • Accounts payable (including related parties) and floating-rate debt: The carrying amount of accounts payable and floating-rate
       debt reported on the balance sheet approximates fair value.
   • Fixed-rate debt: The estimated fair value of fixed-rate debt is measured using prices available from a pricing service that is
       corroborated by market data; therefore, these liabilities are categorized as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.
   • Commercial paper: The carrying amount of our commercial paper instruments approximates fair value and is reported on the
       balance sheet as short-term debt.

In late 2016, we initiated our current share repurchase program. In October 2022, our Board of Directors approved an increase to our
authorization from $25 billion to $45 billion of our common stock to support our plan for future share repurchases. In May 2021, we
began a paced monetization of our CVE common shares, the proceeds of which have been applied to share repurchases. During the
first quarter of 2022, we sold our remaining 91 million CVE common shares. Share repurchases since inception of our current program
totaled 335 million shares at a cost of $23 billion through the end of December 2022.

Note 15—Non-Mineral Leases
The company primarily leases office buildings and drilling equipment, as well as ocean transport vessels, tugboats, corporate aircraft,
and other facilities and equipment. Certain leases include escalation clauses for adjusting rental payments to reflect changes in price
indices and other leases include payment provisions that vary based on the nature of usage of the leased asset. Additionally, the
company has executed certain leases that provide it with the option to extend or renew the term of the lease, terminate the lease prior
to the end of the lease term, or purchase the leased asset as of the end of the lease term. In other cases, the company has executed
lease agreements that require it to guarantee the residual value of certain leased office buildings. For additional information about
guarantees, see Note 10. There are no significant restrictions imposed on us by the lease agreements with regard to dividends, asset
dispositions or borrowing ability.

We determine if an arrangement is or contains a lease at contract inception. Certain contractual arrangements may contain both lease
and non-lease components. Only the lease components of these contractual arrangements are subject to the provisions of ASC Topic
842, and any non-lease components are subject to other applicable accounting guidance; however, we have elected to adopt the
optional practical expedient not to separate lease components apart from non-lease components for existing asset classes (as of the
adoption date of ASC 842) for accounting purposes. For contractual arrangements involving a new leased asset class, we determine at
contract inception whether it will apply the optional practical expedient to the new leased asset class.

Leases are evaluated for classification as operating or finance leases at the commencement date of the lease and right-of-use assets
and corresponding liabilities are recognized on our consolidated balance sheet based on the present value of future lease payments
relating to the use of the underlying asset during the lease term. Future lease payments include variable lease payments that depend
upon an index or rate using the index or rate at the commencement date and probable amounts owed under residual value guarantees.
The amount of future lease payments may be increased to include additional payments related to lease extension, termination, and/or
purchase options when the company has determined, at or subsequent to lease commencement, generally due to limited asset
availability or operating commitments, it is reasonably certain of exercising such options. We use our incremental borrowing rate as the
discount rate in determining the present value of future lease payments, unless the interest rate implicit in the lease arrangement is
readily determinable. Lease payments that vary subsequent to the commencement date based on future usage levels, the nature of
leased asset activities, or certain other contingencies are not included in the measurement of lease right-of-use assets and
corresponding liabilities. We have elected not to record assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet for lease arrangements
with terms of 12 months or less.

We often enter into leasing arrangements acting in the capacity as operator for and/or on behalf of certain oil and gas joint ventures of
undivided interests. If the lease arrangement can be legally enforced only against us as operator and there is no separate arrangement
to sublease the underlying leased asset to our coventurers, we recognize at lease commencement a right-of-use asset and
corresponding lease liability on our consolidated balance sheet on a gross basis. While we record lease costs on a gross basis in our
consolidated income statement and statement of cash flows, such costs are offset by the reimbursement we receive from our
coventurers for their share of the lease cost as the underlying leased asset is utilized in joint venture activities. As a result, lease cost is
presented in our consolidated income statement and statement of cash flows on a proportional basis. If we are a nonoperating
coventurer, we recognize a right-of-use asset and corresponding lease liability only if we were a specified contractual party to the lease
arrangement and the arrangement could be legally enforced against us. In this circumstance, we would recognize both the right-of-use
asset and corresponding lease liability on our consolidated balance sheet on a proportional basis consistent with our undivided interest
ownership in the related joint venture.

The company has historically recorded certain finance leases executed by investee companies accounted for under the proportionate
consolidation method of accounting on its consolidated balance sheet on a proportional basis consistent with its ownership interest in
the investee company. In addition, the company has historically recorded finance lease assets and liabilities associated with certain oil
and gas joint ventures on a proportional basis pursuant to accounting guidance applicable prior to the adoption date of ASC 842 on
January 1, 2019. In accordance with the transition provisions of ASC Topic 842, and since we have elected to adopt the package of
optional transition-related practical expedients, the historical accounting treatment for these leases has been carried forward and is
subject to reconsideration upon the modification or other required reassessment of the arrangements prior to lease term expiration.

For both U.S. and international pension plans, the overall expected long-term rate of return is developed from the expected future return
of each asset class, weighted by the expected allocation of pension assets to that asset class. We rely on a variety of independent
market forecasts in developing the expected rate of return for each class of assets.

During 2022 and 2021, the actuarial gains related to the benefit obligations for U.S. and international plans were primarily related to an
increase in the discount rates. During 2020, the actuarial losses related to the benefit obligations for U.S. and international plans were
primarily related to a decrease in the discount rates.

We recognized pension settlement losses of $37 million in 2022, $102 million in 2021, and $43 million in 2020 as lump-sum benefit
payments from certain U.S. and international pension plans exceeded the sum of service and interest costs for those plans and led to
recognition of settlement losses.

In determining net pension and other postretirement benefit costs, we amortize prior service costs on a straight-line basis over the
average remaining service period of employees expected to receive benefits under the plan. For net actuarial gains and losses, we
amortize 10 percent of the unamortized balance each year.

We have multiple non-pension postretirement benefit plans for health and life insurance. The health care plans are contributory and
subject to various cost sharing features, most with participant and company contributions adjusted annually; the life insurance plans are
noncontributory. The measurement of the U.S. pre-65 retiree medical accumulated postretirement benefit obligation assumes a health
care cost trend rate of 6.5 percent in 2023 that declines to 5 percent by 2029. The measurement of the U.S. post-65 retiree medical
accumulated postretirement benefit obligation assumes a health care cost trend rate of 4.5 percent in 2023 that increases to 5 percent
by 2029.

Plan Assets
We follow a policy of broadly diversifying pension plan assets across asset classes and individual holdings. As a result, our plan assets
have no significant concentrations of credit risk. Asset classes that are considered appropriate include U.S. equities, non-U.S. equities,
U.S. fixed income, non-U.S. fixed income, real estate and private equity investments. Plan fiduciaries may consider and add other asset
classes to the investment program from time to time. The target allocations for plan assets are 25 percent equity securities, 71 percent
debt securities, and 4 percent real estate. Generally, the plan investments are publicly traded, therefore minimizing liquidity risk in the
portfolio.

The following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for the pension plan assets. There have been no changes in the
methodologies used at December 31, 2022 and 2021.
   • Fair values of equity securities and government debt securities categorized in Level 1 are primarily based on quoted market
         prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.
   • Fair values of corporate debt securities, agency and mortgage-backed securities and government debt securities categorized in
         Level 2 are estimated using recently executed transactions and quoted market prices for similar assets and liabilities in active
         markets and for identical assets and liabilities in markets that are not active. If there have been no market transactions in a
         particular fixed income security, its fair value is calculated by pricing models that benchmark the security against other
         securities with actual market prices. When observable quoted market prices are not available, fair value is based on pricing
         models that use something other than actual market prices (e.g., observable inputs such as benchmark yields, reported trades
         and issuer spreads for similar securities), and these securities are categorized in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.
   • Fair values of investments in common/collective trusts are determined by the issuer of each fund based on the fair value of the
         underlying assets.
   • Fair values of mutual funds are based on quoted market prices, which represent the net asset value of shares held.
   • Time deposits are valued at cost, which approximates fair value.
   • Cash is valued at cost, which approximates fair value. Fair values of international cash equivalents categorized in Level 2 are
         valued using observable yield curves, discounting and interest rates. U.S. cash balances held in the form of short-term fund
         units that are redeemable at the measurement date are categorized as Level 2.
   • Fair values of exchange-traded derivatives classified in Level 1 are based on quoted market prices. For other derivatives
         classified in Level 2, the values are generally calculated from pricing models with market input parameters from third-party
         sources.
   • Fair values of insurance contracts are valued at the present value of the future benefit payments owed by the insurance
         company to the plans’ participants.
   • Fair values of real estate investments are valued using real estate valuation techniques and other methods that include
         reference to third-party sources and sales comparables where available.

      •   A portion of U.S. pension plan assets is held as a participating interest in an insurance annuity contract, which is calculated as
          the market value of investments held under this contract, less the accumulated benefit obligation covered by the contract. The
          participating interest is classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy as the fair value is determined via a combination of
          quoted market prices, recently executed transactions, and an actuarial present value computation for contract obligations. At
          December 31, 2022, the participating interest in the annuity contract was valued at $55 million and consisted of $144 million in
          debt securities, less $89 million for the accumulated benefit obligation covered by the contract. At December 31, 2021, the
          participating interest in the annuity contract was valued at $83 million and consisted of $206 million in debt securities, less $123
          million for the accumulated benefit obligation covered by the contract. The participating interest is not available for meeting
          general pension benefit obligations in the near term. No future company contributions are required and no new benefits are
          being accrued under this insurance annuity contract.

Our funding policy for U.S. plans is to contribute at least the minimum required by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of
1974 and the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Contributions to foreign plans are dependent upon local laws and tax

Defined Contribution Plans
Most U.S. employees are eligible to participate in the ConocoPhillips Savings Plan (CPSP). Employees can deposit up to 75 percent of
their eligible pay, subject to statutory limits, in the CPSP to a choice of 17 investment options. Employees who participate in the CPSP
and contribute 1 percent of their eligible pay receive a 6 percent company cash match with a potential company discretionary cash
contribution of up to 6 percent. Effective January 1, 2019, new employees, rehires and employees that elected to opt out of Title II of the
ConocoPhillips Retirement Plan are eligible to receive a Company Retirement Contribution (CRC) of 6 percent of eligible pay into their
CPSP. After three years of service with the company, the employee is 100 percent vested in any CRC. Company contributions charged
to expense for the CPSP and predecessor plans were $140 million in 2022, $93 million in 2021 and $62 million in 2020.

We have several defined contribution plans for our international employees, each with its own terms and eligibility depending on
location. Total compensation expense recognized for these international plans was approximately $24 million in 2022, $26 million in
2021 and $25 million in 2020.

Share-Based Compensation Plans
The 2014 Omnibus Stock and Performance Incentive Plan of ConocoPhillips (the Plan) was approved by shareholders in May 2014,
replacing similar prior plans and providing that no new awards shall be granted under the prior plans. Over its 10-year life, the Plan
allows the issuance of up to 79 million shares of our common stock for compensation to our employees and directors; however, as of
the effective date of the Plan, (i) any shares of common stock available for future awards under the prior plans and (ii) any shares of
common stock represented by awards granted under the Plan or the prior plans that are forfeited, expire or are cancelled without
delivery of shares of common stock or which result in the forfeiture of shares of common stock back to the company shall be available
for awards under the Plan. Of the 79 million shares available for issuance under the Plan, no more than 40 million shares of common
stock are available for incentive stock options. The Human Resources and Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors is
authorized to determine the types, terms, conditions and limitations of awards granted. Awards may be granted in the form of, but not
limited to, stock options, restricted stock units and performance share units to employees and non-employee directors who contribute to
the company’s continued success and profitability.

Total share-based compensation expense is measured using the grant date fair value for our equity-classified awards and the
settlement date fair value for our liability-classified awards. We recognize share-based compensation expense over the shorter of the
service period (i.e., the stated period of time required to earn the award); or the period beginning at the start of the service period and
ending when an employee first becomes eligible for retirement, but not less than six months, as this is the minimum period of time
required for an award to not be subject to forfeiture. Our share-based compensation programs generally provide accelerated vesting
(i.e., a waiver of the remaining period of service required to earn an award) for awards held by employees at the time of their retirement.
Some of our share-based awards vest ratably (i.e., portions of the award vest at different times) while some of our awards cliff vest (i.e.,
all of the award vests at the same time). We recognize expense on a straight-line basis over the service period for the entire award,
whether the award was granted with ratable or cliff vesting.

Stock Options—Stock options granted under the provisions of the Plan and prior plans permit purchase of our common stock at
exercise prices equivalent to the average fair market value of ConocoPhillips common stock on the date the options were granted. The
options have terms of 10 years and generally vest ratably, with one-third of the options awarded vesting and becoming exercisable on
each anniversary date following the date of grant. Options awarded to certain employees already eligible for retirement vest within six
months of the grant date, but those options do not become exercisable until the end of the normal vesting period. Beginning in 2018,
stock option grants were discontinued and replaced with three-year, time-vested restricted stock units which generally will be cash-
settled for 2018 and 2019 awards and stock-settled beginning with 2020 awards.

The weighted-average remaining contractual term of outstanding options, vested options and exercisable options at December 31,
2022, were all 2.57 years. The aggregate intrinsic value of options exercised was $68 million in 2021 and $23 million in 2020.

During 2022, we received $438 million in cash and realized a tax benefit of $59 million from the exercise of options. At December 31,
2022, all outstanding stock options were fully vested and there was no remaining compensation cost to be recorded.

Stock Unit Program—Generally, restricted stock units (RSU) are granted annually under the provisions of the Plan and vest in an
aggregate installment on the third anniversary of the grant date. In addition, RSUs granted under the Plan for a variable long-term
incentive program vest ratably in three equal annual installments beginning on the first anniversary of the grant date. Restricted stock
units are also granted ad hoc to attract or retain key personnel, and the terms and conditions under which these restricted stock units
vest vary by award.

Stock-Settled
Upon vesting, these restricted stock units are settled by issuing one share of ConocoPhillips common stock per unit. Units awarded to
retirement eligible employees vest six months from the grant date; however, those units are not issued as common stock until the
earlier of separation from the company or the end of the regularly scheduled vesting period. Until issued as stock, most recipients of the
RSUs receive a cash payment of a dividend equivalent or an accrued reinvested dividend equivalent that is charged to retained
earnings. The grant date fair market value of these RSUs is deemed equal to the average ConocoPhillips stock price on the grant date.
The grant date fair market value of units that do not receive a dividend equivalent while unvested is deemed equal to the average
ConocoPhillips stock price on the grant date, less the net present value of the dividends that will not be received.

At December 31, 2022, the remaining unrecognized compensation cost from the unvested stock-settled units was $135 million, which
will be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.67 years, the longest period being 2.67 years. The weighted-average grant date
fair value of stock unit awards granted during 2021 and 2020 was $46.56 and $57.40, respectively. The total fair value of stock units
issued during 2021 and 2020 was $144 million and $143 million, respectively.

Cash-Settled
Cash settled executive restricted stock units granted in 2018 and 2019 replaced the stock option program. These restricted stock units,
subject to elections to defer, will be settled in cash equal to the fair market value of a share of ConocoPhillips common stock per unit on
the settlement date and are classified as liabilities on the balance sheet. Units awarded to retirement eligible employees vest six
months from the grant date; however, those units are not settled until the earlier of separation from the company or the end of the
regularly scheduled vesting period. Compensation expense is initially measured using the average fair market value of ConocoPhillips
common stock and is subsequently adjusted, based on changes in the ConocoPhillips stock price through the end of each subsequent
reporting period, through the settlement date. Recipients receive an accrued reinvested dividend equivalent that is charged to
compensation expense. The accrued reinvested dividend is paid at the time of settlement, subject to the terms and conditions of the
award. Beginning with executive restricted stock units granted in 2020, awards will be settled in stock.

Performance Share Program—Under the Plan, we also annually grant restricted performance share units (PSUs) to senior
management. These PSUs are authorized three years prior to their effective grant date (the performance period). Compensation
expense is initially measured using the average fair market value of ConocoPhillips common stock and is subsequently adjusted, based
on changes in the ConocoPhillips stock price through the end of each subsequent reporting period, through the grant date for stock-
settled awards and the settlement date for cash-settled awards.

Stock-Settled
For performance periods beginning before 2009, PSUs do not vest until the employee becomes eligible for retirement by reaching age
55 with five years of service, and restrictions do not lapse until the employee separates from the company. With respect to awards for
performance periods beginning in 2009 through 2012, PSUs do not vest until the earlier of the date the employee becomes eligible for
retirement by reaching age 55 with five years of service or five years after the grant date of the award, and restrictions do not lapse until
the earlier of the employee’s separation from the company or five years after the grant date (although recipients can elect to defer the
lapsing of restrictions until separation). We recognize compensation expense for these awards beginning on the grant date and ending
on the date the PSUs are scheduled to vest. Since these awards are authorized three years prior to the effective grant date, for
employees eligible for retirement by or shortly after the grant date, we recognize compensation expense over the period beginning on
the date of authorization and ending on the date of grant. Until issued as stock, recipients of the PSUs receive a cash payment of a
dividend equivalent that is charged to retained earnings. Beginning in 2013, PSUs authorized for future grants will vest, absent
employee election to defer, upon settlement following the conclusion of the three-year performance period. We recognize compensation
expense over the period beginning on the date of authorization and ending on the conclusion of the performance period. PSUs are
settled by issuing one share of ConocoPhillips common stock per unit.

At December 31, 2022, there was no remaining unrecognized compensation cost to be recorded on the unvested stock-settled
performance shares. There were no stock-settled PSUs granted during 2021; however, the weighted-average grant date fair value of
stock-settled PSUs granted during 2020 was $58.61. The total fair value of stock-settled PSUs issued during 2021 and 2020 were $18
million and $13 million, respectively.

Cash-Settled
In connection with and immediately following the separation of our Downstream businesses in 2012, grants of new PSUs, subject to a
shortened performance period, were authorized. Once granted, these PSUs vest, absent employee election to defer, on the earlier of
five years after the grant date of the award or the date the employee becomes eligible for retirement. For employees eligible for
retirement by or shortly after the grant date, we recognize compensation expense over the period beginning on the date of authorization
and ending on the date of grant. Otherwise, we recognize compensation expense beginning on the grant date and ending on the date
the PSUs are scheduled to vest. These PSUs are settled in cash equal to the fair market value of a share of ConocoPhillips common
stock per unit on the settlement date and thus are classified as liabilities on the balance sheet. Until settlement occurs, recipients of the
PSUs receive a cash payment of a dividend equivalent that is charged to compensation expense.

Beginning in 2013, PSUs authorized for future grants will vest upon settlement following the conclusion of the three-year performance
period. We recognize compensation expense over the period beginning on the date of authorization and ending at the conclusion of the
performance period. These PSUs will be settled in cash equal to the fair market value of a share of ConocoPhillips common stock per
unit on the settlement date and are classified as liabilities on the balance sheet. For performance periods beginning before 2018, during
the performance period, recipients of the PSUs do not receive a cash payment of a dividend equivalent, but after the performance
period ends, until settlement in cash occurs, recipients of the PSUs receive a cash payment of a dividend equivalent that is charged to
compensation expense. For the performance period beginning in 2018, recipients of the PSUs receive an accrued reinvested dividend
equivalent that is charged to compensation expense. The accrued reinvested dividend is paid at the time of settlement, subject to the
terms and conditions of the award.

At December 31, 2022, all outstanding cash-settled performance awards were fully vested and there was no remaining compensation
cost to be recorded. The weighted-average grant date fair value of cash-settled PSUs granted during 2021 and 2020 was $46.65 and
$58.61, respectively. The total fair value of cash-settled performance share awards settled during 2021 and 2020 was $52 million and
$116 million, respectively.

From inception of the Performance Share Program through 2013, approved PSU awards were granted after the conclusion of
performance periods. Beginning in February 2014, initial target PSU awards are issued near the beginning of new performance periods.
These initial target PSU awards will terminate at the end of the performance periods and will be settled after the performance periods
have ended. Also in 2014, initial target PSU awards were issued for open performance periods that began in prior years. For the open
performance period beginning in 2012, the initial target PSU awards terminated at the end of the three-year performance period and
were replaced with approved PSU awards. For the open performance period beginning in 2013, the initial target PSU awards
terminated at the end of the three-year performance period and were settled after the performance period ended. There is no effect on
recognition of compensation expense.

Other—In addition to the above active programs, we have outstanding shares of restricted stock and restricted stock units that were
either issued as part of our non-employee director compensation program for current and former members of the company’s Board of
Directors, as part of an executive compensation program that has been discontinued or acquired as a result of an acquisition.
Generally, the recipients of the restricted shares or units receive a dividend or dividend equivalent.

Valuation allowances have been established to reduce deferred tax assets to an amount that will, more likely than not, be realized. At
December 31, 2022, we have maintained a valuation allowance with respect to substantially all U.S. foreign tax credit carryforwards,
basis differences in our APLNG investment, and certain net operating loss carryforwards for various jurisdictions. During 2022, the
valuation allowance movement charged to earnings primarily relates to the impact of 2022 changes to Norway’s Petroleum Tax System
which is partly offset by the U.S. tax impact of the disposition of our CVE common shares. Other movements are primarily related to
valuation allowances on expiring tax attributes. Based on our historical taxable income, expectations for the future, and available tax-
planning strategies, management expects deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowances, will primarily be realized as offsets to
reversing deferred tax liabilities.

During the second quarter of 2022, Norway enacted changes to the Petroleum Tax System. As a result of the enactment, a valuation
allowance of $58 million was recorded during the second quarter to reflect changes to our ability to realize certain deferred tax assets
under the new law.

During 2021, the valuation allowance movement charged to earnings primarily relates to the fair value measurement of our CVE
common shares that are not expected to be realized, and the expected realization of certain U.S. tax attributes associated with our
planned disposition of our Indonesia assets. This is partially offset by Australian tax benefits associated with our impairment of APLNG
that we do not expect to be realized. Other movements are primarily related to valuation allowances on expiring tax attributes. For more
information on our Indonesia disposition see Note 3.

During 2020, the valuation allowance movement charged to earnings primarily related to capital losses in Australia and to the fair value
measurement of our CVE common shares that are not expected to be realized. Other movements are primarily related to valuation
allowances on expiring tax attributes.

At December 31, 2022, unremitted income considered to be permanently reinvested in certain foreign subsidiaries and foreign
corporate joint ventures totaled approximately $4,477 million. Deferred income taxes have not been provided on this amount, as we do
not plan to initiate any action that would require the payment of income taxes. The estimated amount of additional tax, primarily local
withholding tax, that would be payable on this income if distributed is approximately $224 million.

Included in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits for 2022, 2021 and 2020 were $701 million, $1,261 million and $1,128 million
respectively, which, if recognized, would impact our effective tax rate. The balance of the unrecognized tax benefits decreased due to
the closing of the 2017 audit of our federal income tax return. As a result, we recognized federal and state tax benefits totaling $515
million relating to the recovery of outside tax basis previously offset by a full reserve. The balance of the unrecognized tax benefits
increased in 2021 mainly due to U.S. tax credits acquired through our Concho acquisition. See Note 3 and Note 11.

At December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, accrued liabilities for interest and penalties totaled $35 million, $47 million and $46 million,
respectively, net of accrued income taxes. Interest and penalties resulted in an increase to earnings of $12 million in 2022, a reduction
of $1 million in 2021 and a reduction to earnings of $4 million in 2020.

We file tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and in many foreign and state jurisdictions. Audits in major jurisdictions are generally
complete as follows: Canada (2016), Norway (2021) and U.S. (2018). Issues in dispute for audited years and audits for subsequent
years are ongoing and in various stages of completion in the many jurisdictions in which we operate around the world. Consequently,
the balance in unrecognized tax benefits can be expected to fluctuate from period to period. Within the next twelve months, we may
have audit periods close that could significantly impact our total unrecognized tax benefits. It is reasonably possible such changes could
be significant when compared with our total unrecognized tax benefits, but the amount of change is not estimable.

Our effective tax rate for 2022 was driven by our jurisdictional tax rates for this profit mix with net favorable impacts from routine tax
credits and valuation allowance adjustments. The adjustment to tax reserves primarily relates to the closing of the audit of our 2017
U.S. federal tax return and the recognition of the U.S. federal and state tax benefits described above.

Our effective tax rate for 2021 was driven by our jurisdictional tax rates for this profit mix with net favorable impacts from routine tax
credits and valuation allowance adjustments. The valuation allowance adjustment is primarily related to the fair value measurement and
disposition of our CVE common shares of $218 million and the ability to utilize the U.S. foreign tax credit and capital loss carryforward
due to our anticipated disposition of our Indonesia entities of $29 million. This was partially offset by an increase to our valuation
allowance related to the tax impact of the impairment of our APLNG investment of $206 million for which we do not expect to receive a
tax benefit.

Our effective tax rate for 2020 was impacted by the disposition of our Australia-West assets as well as the valuation allowance related
to the fair value measurement of our CVE common shares. The Australia-West disposition generated a before-tax gain of $587 million
with an associated tax benefit of $10 million and resulted in the de-recognition of deferred tax assets resulting in $92 million of tax
expense. The disposition also generated an Australia capital loss tax benefit of $313 million which has been fully offset by a valuation
allowance. Due to changes in the fair market value of CVE common shares, the valuation allowance was increased by $178 million to
offset the expected capital loss.

On August 16, 2022, the U.S. enacted the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which among other things, implements a 15 percent
minimum tax on book income of certain large corporations, a 1 percent excise tax on net stock repurchases and several tax incentives
to promote lower carbon energy. We are continuing to evaluate the impacts of this legislation as additional guidance is released;
however, we do not believe any impacts will be material to our consolidated financial statements.

Revenues from contracts outside the scope of ASC Topic 606 relate primarily to physical gas contracts at market prices, which qualify
as derivatives accounted for under ASC Topic 815, “Derivatives and Hedging,” and for which we have not elected NPNS. There is no
significant difference in contractual terms or the policy for recognition of revenue from these contracts and those within the scope of
ASC Topic 606. The following disaggregation of revenues is provided in conjunction with Note 24—Segment Disclosures and Related

Practical Expedients
Typically, our commodity sales contracts are less than 12 months in duration; however, in certain specific cases may extend longer,
which may be out to the end of field life. We have long-term commodity sales contracts which use prevailing market prices at the time of
delivery, and under these contracts, the market-based variable consideration for each performance obligation (i.e., delivery of
commodity) is allocated to each wholly unsatisfied performance obligation within the contract. Accordingly, we have applied the
practical expedient allowed in ASC Topic 606 and do not disclose the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to
performance obligations or when we expect to recognize revenues that are unsatisfied (or partially unsatisfied) as of the end of the
reporting period.

Receivables and Contract Liabilities

Receivables from Contracts with Customers
At December 31, 2022, the “Accounts and notes receivable” line on our consolidated balance sheet included trade receivables of
$5,241 million compared with $5,268 million at December 31, 2021, and included both contracts with customers within the scope of
ASC Topic 606 and those that are outside the scope of ASC Topic 606. We typically receive payment within 30 days or less (depending
on the terms of the invoice) once delivery is made. Revenues that are outside the scope of ASC Topic 606 relate primarily to physical
gas sales contracts at market prices for which we do not elect NPNS and are therefore accounted for as a derivative under ASC Topic
815. There is little distinction in the nature of the customer or credit quality of trade receivables associated with gas sold under contracts
for which NPNS has not been elected compared with trade receivables where NPNS has been elected.

Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers
We have entered into certain agreements under which we license our proprietary technology, including the Optimized Cascade®
process technology, to customers to maximize the efficiency of LNG plants. These agreements typically provide for milestone payments
to be made during and after the construction phases of the LNG plant. The payments are not directly related to our performance
obligations under the contract and are recorded as deferred revenue to be recognized when the customer is able to benefit from their
right to use the applicable licensed technology. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we recognized revenue of $57 million in the
"Sales and other operating revenues" line on our consolidated income statement. We expect to recognize the outstanding contract
liabilities of $19 million as of December 31, 2022, as revenue during 2026.

Note 24—Segment Disclosures and Related Information
We explore for, produce, transport and market crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, LNG and NGLs on a worldwide basis. We manage our
operations through six operating segments, which are primarily defined by geographic region: Alaska; Lower 48; Canada; Europe,
Middle East and North Africa; Asia Pacific; and Other International.

Corporate and Other represents income and costs not directly associated with an operating segment, such as most interest expense,
premiums on early retirement of debt, corporate overhead and certain technology activities, including licensing revenues. Corporate
assets include all cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments.

We evaluate performance and allocate resources based on net income (loss) attributable to ConocoPhillips. Segment accounting
policies are the same as those in Note 1. Intersegment sales are at prices that approximate market.

In 2021, we completed our acquisition of Concho, an independent oil and gas exploration and production company with operations
across New Mexico and West Texas as well as our acquisition of Shell’s Permian assets in the Texas Delaware Basin. The accounting
close date of the Shell transaction, used for reporting purposes, was December 31, 2021. Results of operations for Concho and assets
acquired from Shell are included in our Lower 48 segment. Certain transaction and restructuring costs associated with these
acquisitions are included in our Corporate and Other segment. See Note 3.

Oil and Gas Operations (Unaudited)

In accordance with FASB ASC Topic 932, “Extractive Activities—Oil and Gas,” and regulations of the SEC, we are making certain
supplemental disclosures about our oil and gas exploration and production operations.

These disclosures include information about our consolidated oil and gas activities and our proportionate share of our equity affiliates’
oil and gas activities in our operating segments. As a result, amounts reported as equity affiliates in Oil and Gas Operations may differ
from those shown in the individual segment disclosures reported elsewhere in this report. Our disclosures by geographic area include
the U.S., Canada, Europe, Asia Pacific/Middle East (inclusive of equity affiliates) and Africa.

As required by current authoritative guidelines, the estimated future date when an asset will be permanently shut down for economic
reasons is based on historical 12-month first-of-month average prices and current costs. This estimated date when production will end
affects the amount of estimated reserves. Therefore, as prices and cost levels change from year to year, the estimate of proved
reserves also changes. Generally, our proved reserves decrease as prices decline and increase as prices rise.

Our proved reserves include estimated quantities related to PSCs, which are reported under the “economic interest” method, as well as
variable-royalty regimes, and are subject to fluctuations in commodity prices, recoverable operating expenses and capital costs. If costs
remain stable, reserve quantities attributable to recovery of costs will change inversely to changes in commodity prices. For example, if
prices increase, then our applicable reserve quantities would decline. At December 31, 2022, approximately 3 percent of our total
proved reserves were under PSCs, located in our Asia Pacific/Middle East geographic reporting area, and 4 percent of our total proved
reserves were under a variable-royalty regime, located in our Canada geographic reporting area.

Reserves Governance
The recording and reporting of proved reserves are governed by criteria established by regulations of the SEC and FASB. Proved
reserves are those quantities of oil and gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable
certainty to be economically producible—from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions,
operating methods, and government regulations—prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless
evidence indicates renewal is reasonably certain, regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the
estimation. The project to extract the hydrocarbons must have commenced or the operator must be reasonably certain it will commence
the project within a reasonable time.

Proved reserves are further classified as either developed or undeveloped. Proved developed reserves are proved reserves that can be
expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods, or in which the cost of the required
equipment is relatively minor compared with the cost of a new well, and through installed extraction equipment and infrastructure
operational at the time of the reserves estimate if the extraction is by means not involving a well. Proved undeveloped reserves are
proved reserves expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major
expenditure is required for recompletion. Reserves on undrilled acreage are limited to those directly offsetting development spacing
areas that are reasonably certain of production when drilled, unless evidence provided by reliable technologies exists that establishes
reasonable certainty of economic producibility at greater distances. As defined by SEC regulations, reliable technologies may be used
in reserve estimation when they have been demonstrated in the field to provide reasonably certain results with consistency and
repeatability in the formation being evaluated or in an analogous formation. The technologies and data used in the estimation of our
proved reserves include, but are not limited to, performance-based methods, volumetric-based methods, geologic maps, seismic
interpretation, well logs, well test data, core data, analogy and statistical analysis.

We have a company-wide, comprehensive, SEC-compliant internal policy that governs the determination and reporting of proved
reserves. This policy is applied by the geoscientists and reservoir engineers in our business units around the world. As part of our
internal control process, each business unit’s reserves processes and controls are reviewed annually by an internal team which is
headed by the company’s Manager of Reserves Compliance and Reporting. This team, composed of internal reservoir engineers,
geoscientists, finance personnel and a senior representative from DeGolyer and MacNaughton (D&M), a third-party petroleum
engineering consulting firm, reviews the business units’ reserves for adherence to SEC guidelines and company policy through on-site
visits, teleconferences and review of documentation. In addition to providing independent reviews, this internal team also ensures
reserves are calculated using consistent and appropriate standards and procedures. This team is independent of business unit line
management and is responsible for reporting its findings to senior management. The team is responsible for communicating our
reserves policy and procedures and is available for internal peer reviews and consultation on major projects or technical issues
throughout the year. All of our proved reserves held by consolidated companies and our share of equity affiliates have been estimated
by ConocoPhillips.

During 2022, our processes and controls used to assess over 90 percent of proved reserves as of December 31, 2022, were reviewed
by D&M. The purpose of their review was to assess whether the adequacy and effectiveness of our internal processes and controls
used to determine estimates of proved reserves are in accordance with SEC regulations. In such review, ConocoPhillips’ technical staff
presented D&M with an overview of the reserves data, as well as the methods and assumptions used in estimating reserves. The data
presented included pertinent seismic information, geologic maps, well logs, production tests, material balance calculations, reservoir
simulation models, well performance data, operating procedures and relevant economic criteria. Management’s intent in retaining D&M
to review its processes and controls was to provide objective third-party input on these processes and controls. D&M’s opinion was the
general processes and controls employed by ConocoPhillips in estimating its December 31, 2022, proved reserves for the properties
reviewed are in accordance with the SEC reserves definitions. D&M’s report is included as Exhibit 99 of this Annual Report on Form 10-
K.

The technical person primarily responsible for overseeing the processes and internal controls used in the preparation of the company’s
reserves estimates is the Manager of Reserves Compliance and Reporting. This individual holds a master’s degree in petroleum
engineering. He is a member of the Society of Petroleum Engineers with over 30 years of oil and gas industry experience and has held
positions of increasing responsibility in reservoir engineering, subsurface and asset management in the U.S. and several international
field locations.

Engineering estimates of the quantities of proved reserves are inherently imprecise. See the “Critical Accounting Estimates” section of
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for additional discussion of the sensitivities
surrounding these estimates.

Notable changes in proved crude oil reserves in the three years ended December 31, 2022, included:

      •   Revisions: In 2022, upward revisions in Lower 48 were due to additional development drilling in the unconventional plays of 81
          million barrels and higher prices of 33 million barrels, partially offset by increasing operating costs of 72 million barrels and
          technical revisions of 18 million barrels. Upward revisions in Europe were primarily due to technical revisions of 23 million
          barrels and 8 million barrels due to higher prices. Upward revisions of 19 million barrels in our consolidated operations in Asia
          Pacific/Middle East were primarily due to technical revisions.

          In 2021, Alaska upward revisions were primarily driven by higher prices. Downward revisions in Lower 48 were due to
          development timing for specific well locations from unconventional plays of 203 million barrels and technical revisions of 35
          million barrels, partially offset by upward revisions due to higher prices of 115 million barrels and additional infill drilling in the
          unconventional plays of 71 million barrels. Upward revisions in Europe were primarily due to higher prices. In Asia
          Pacific/Middle East, increases were due to higher prices of 21 million barrels and technical revisions of 16 million barrels.

          In 2020, Alaska downward revisions were primarily driven by lower prices of 243 million barrels and development plan changes
          of 54 million barrels. Downward revisions in Lower 48 were due to lower prices of 89 million barrels and development timing for
          specific well locations from unconventional plays of 82 million barrels, partially offset by upward technical revisions and
          additional infill drilling in the unconventional plays of 45 million barrels.

      •   Purchases: In 2022, crude oil reserve purchases were primarily in Africa, as a result of the acquisition of additional interest in
          the Libya Waha Concession.

          In 2021, Lower 48 purchases were due to the Concho and Shell Permian acquisitions.

      •   Extensions and discoveries: In 2022, extensions and discoveries in Lower 48 were primarily within unconventional plays in the
          Permian Basin. Extensions and discoveries in our equity affiliates were in the Middle East.

          In 2021, extensions and discoveries in Lower 48 were due to planned development to add specific well locations from the
          unconventional plays which more than offset the decreases resulting from development plan timing in the revisions category.

          In 2020, extensions and discoveries in Lower 48 were due to planned development to add specific well locations from the
          unconventional plays which more than offset the decreases resulting from development plan timing in the revisions category.

Notable changes in proved NGL reserves in the three years ended December 31, 2022, included:

      •   Revisions: In 2022, upward revisions in Lower 48 were due to additional development drilling in the unconventional plays of 88
          million barrels, technical revisions of 75 million barrels, continued conversion of acquired Concho Permian two-stream contracts
          to a three-stream (crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids) basis adding 70 million barrels, and higher prices of 13 million
          barrels. This was partially offset by increasing operating costs of 38 million barrels.

          In 2021, upward revisions in Lower 48 were due to conversion of acquired Concho Permian two-stream contracts to a three-
          stream (crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids) basis, adding 182 million barrels, additional infill drilling in the
          unconventional plays of 44 million barrels, technical revisions of 21 million barrels and higher prices of 28 million barrels,
          partially offset by downward revisions related to development timing for specific well locations from unconventional plays of 62
          million barrels.

          In 2020, downward revisions in Lower 48 were due to lower prices of 33 million barrels and development timing for specific well
          locations from unconventional plays of 20 million barrels, partially offset by upward technical revisions and additional infill
          drilling in the unconventional plays of 27 million barrels.

      •   Purchases: In 2021, Lower 48 purchases were due to the Shell Permian acquisition.

      •   Extensions and discoveries: In 2022, extensions and discoveries in Lower 48 were primarily within unconventional plays in the
          Permian Basin. Extensions and discoveries in our equity affiliates were in the Middle East.

          In 2021, extensions and discoveries in Lower 48 were due to planned development to add specific well locations from the
          unconventional plays which more than offset the decreases in the revisions category.

          In 2020, extensions and discoveries in Lower 48 were due to planned development to add specific well locations from the
          unconventional plays, which more than offset the decreases in the revisions category.

Natural gas production in the reserves table may differ from gas production (delivered for sale) in our statistics disclosure, primarily
because the quantities above include gas consumed in production operations. Quantities consumed in production operations are not
significant in the periods presented. The value of net production consumed in operations is not reflected in net revenues and production
expenses, nor do the volumes impact the respective per unit metrics.

Reserve volumes include natural gas to be consumed in operations of 2,416 BCF, 2,748 BCF and 2,286 BCF, as of December 31,
2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. These volumes are not included in the calculation of our Standardized Measure of Discounted
Future Net Cash Flows Relating to Proved Oil and Gas Reserve Quantities.

Natural gas reserves are computed at 14.65 pounds per square inch absolute and 60 degrees Fahrenheit.

Notable changes in proved natural gas reserves in the three years ended December 31, 2022, included:

      •   Revisions: In 2022, upward revisions in Lower 48 were due to additional development drilling in the unconventional plays of 544
          BCF, higher prices of 109 BCF, and technical revisions of 41 BCF. These were partially offset by decreases of 233 BCF due to
          increasing operating costs, and 100 BCF due to the continued conversion of acquired Concho Permian two-stream contracts to
          a three-stream (crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids) basis. Upward revisions in Canada were driven by higher prices
          of 26 BCF, partially offset by technical revisions of 18 BCF. In Europe, technical revisions contributed 96 BCF, and higher prices
          12 BCF of upward revisions. Downward revisions in Africa were primarily due to technical revisions. In our equity affiliates in
          Asia Pacific/Middle East, upward revisions were due to higher prices of 423 BCF, changing dynamics and improved prices in
          the regional LNG spot market of 331 BCF, and technical revisions of 204 BCF, partially offset by downward revisions due to
          increasing operating costs of 60 BCF.

          In 2021, upward revisions in Alaska were due to higher prices of 587 BCF and technical revisions of 128 BCF. In Lower 48,
          upward revisions of 614 BCF were due to higher prices, additional infill drilling in the unconventional plays of 277 BCF and
          technical revisions of 60 BCF, partially offset by downward revisions due to development timing for specific well locations from
          unconventional plays of 498 BCF and conversion of previously acquired Permian two-stream contracted volumes to a three-
          stream (crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids) basis of 412 BCF. Upward revisions in Canada were due to higher prices
          of 29 BCF, partially offset by downward revisions due to technical revisions of 14 BCF. In Europe, upward revisions were
          primarily due to higher prices. Upward revisions in our consolidated operations in Asia Pacific/Middle East were due to
          technical revisions of 76 BCF, partially offset by price revisions of 16 BCF. In our equity affiliates in Asia Pacific/Middle East,
          upward revisions were due to higher prices of 124 BCF and technical and cost revisions of 123 BCF.

          In 2020, downward revisions in Alaska were primarily due to lower prices. In Lower 48, downward revisions of 372 BCF were
          due to lower prices and 154 BCF were due to development timing for specific well locations from unconventional plays, partially
          offset by technical revisions of 87 BCF. Downward revisions in our equity affiliates in Asia Pacific/Middle East were due to lower
          prices of 426 BCF, partially offset by performance revisions of 44 BCF. Upward revisions in our consolidated operations in Asia
          Pacific/Middle East were due to technical revisions of 88 BCF and price revisions of 15 BCF.

      •   Purchases: In 2022, purchases in Africa were a result of the acquisition of additional interest in the Libya Waha Concession. In
          our equity affiliates, purchases were due to the acquisition of additional affiliate interest in Asia Pacific.

          In 2021, Lower 48 purchases were due to the Concho and Shell Permian acquisitions.

          In 2020, Canada purchases were due to the acquisition of additional Montney acreage.

      •   Extensions and discoveries: In 2022, extensions and discoveries in Lower 48 were primarily within unconventional plays in the
          Permian Basin. In Europe, extensions and discoveries were due to additional planned development. Extensions and
          discoveries in our equity affiliates were primarily in the Middle East.

          In 2021, extensions and discoveries in Lower 48 were due to planned development to add specific well locations from the
          unconventional plays which more than offset the decreases resulting from development plan timing in the revisions category.
          Extensions and discoveries in Canada were primarily driven by ongoing drilling successes in Montney.

          In 2020, extensions and discoveries in Lower 48 were due to planned development to add specific well locations from the
          unconventional plays which more than offset the decreases resulting from development plan timing in the revisions category.
          Extensions and discoveries in Canada were primarily driven by ongoing drilling successes in Montney.

      •   Sales: In 2022, Lower 48 sales represent the disposition of noncore assets. Sales in our consolidated operations in Asia
          Pacific/Middle East represent the disposition of our Indonesia assets.

          In 2021, Lower 48 sales represent the disposition of noncore assets.

          In 2020, Asia Pacific/Middle East sales represent the disposition of the Australia-West assets.

      •   Revisions: In 2022, the impact of variable royalties on price resulted in downward revisions of 30 million barrels, partially offset
          by upward revisions primarily due to changes in development timing for specific pad locations from the Surmont development
          program.

          In 2021, downward revisions of 64 million barrels were driven by changes in carbon tax costs and 39 million barrels due to
          changes in development timing for specific pad locations from the Surmont development program, partially offset by upward
          revisions from price of 53 million barrels.

          In 2020, downward revisions in Canada were due to changes in development timing for specific pad locations from the Surmont
          development program of 12 million barrels with the remaining revisions primarily related to lower prices.

      •   Extensions and discoveries: In 2021, extensions and discoveries in Canada were primarily due to planned development to add
          specific pad locations from the Surmont development program, which more than offset the decrease in the revisions category.

          In 2020, extensions and discoveries in Canada were due to planned development to add specific pad locations from the
          Surmont development program, which offset the decrease in the revisions category of 31 million barrels.

Revisions were predominantly driven by changes in development plans in Lower 48.

Extensions and discoveries were largely driven by the addition of 344 MMBOE in Lower 48 for the continued development of
unconventional plays. Equity affiliates, primarily in the Middle East, contributed 241 MMBOE. The remaining extensions and discoveries
were driven by the continued development planned in the other geographic regions.

Transfers to proved developed reserves were driven by the ongoing development of our assets. Approximately 82 percent of the
transfers were from the development of our Lower 48 unconventional plays. The remainder of transfers were from development across
the other geographic regions.

At December 31, 2022, our PUDs represented 31 percent of total proved reserves, compared with 24 percent at December 31, 2021.
Costs incurred for the year ended December 31, 2022, relating to the development of PUDs were $5.7 billion. A portion of our costs
incurred each year relates to development projects where the PUDs will be converted to proved developed reserves in future years.

At the end of 2022, approximately 93 percent of total PUDs were under development or scheduled for development within five years of
initial disclosure, including all of our Lower 48 PUDs. The remaining PUDs are in major development areas which are currently
producing and predominantly within our Canada and Asia Pacific/Middle East geographic areas.




Results of Operations

The company’s results of operations from oil and gas activities for the years 2022, 2021 and 2020 are shown in the following tables.
Non-oil and gas activities, such as pipeline and marine operations, LNG operations, crude oil and gas marketing activities, and the profit
element of transportation operations in which we have an ownership interest are excluded. Additional information about selected line
items within the results of operations tables is shown below:
    • Sales include sales to unaffiliated entities attributable primarily to the company’s net working interests and royalty interests.
        Sales are net of fees to transport our produced hydrocarbons beyond the production function to a final delivery point using
        transportation operations which are not consolidated.
    • Transportation costs reflect fees to transport our produced hydrocarbons beyond the production function to a final delivery point
        using transportation operations which are consolidated.
    • Other revenues include gains and losses from asset sales, certain amounts resulting from the purchase and sale of
        hydrocarbons, and other miscellaneous income.
    • Production costs include costs incurred to operate and maintain wells, related equipment and facilities used in the production of
        petroleum liquids and natural gas.
    • Taxes other than income taxes include production, property and other non-income taxes.
    • Depreciation of support equipment is reclassified as applicable.
    • Other related expenses include inventory fluctuations, foreign currency transaction gains and losses and other miscellaneous

Development and Exploration Activities

The following two tables summarize our net interest in productive and dry exploratory and development wells in the years ended
December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020. A “development well” is a well drilled within the proved area of a reservoir to the depth of a
stratigraphic horizon known to be productive. An “exploratory well” is a well drilled to find and produce crude oil or natural gas in an
unknown field or a new reservoir within a proven field. Exploratory wells also include wells drilled in areas near or offsetting current
production, or in areas where well density or production history have not achieved statistical certainty of results. Excluded from the
exploratory well count are stratigraphic-type exploratory wells, primarily relating to oil sands delineation wells located in Canada and
CBM test wells located in Asia Pacific/Middle East.

Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows Relating to Proved Oil and Gas Reserve Quantities
In accordance with SEC and FASB requirements, amounts were computed using 12-month average prices (adjusted only for existing
contractual terms) and end-of-year costs, appropriate statutory tax rates and a prescribed 10 percent discount factor. Twelve-month
average prices are calculated as the unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within the 12-
month period prior to the end of the reporting period. For all years, continuation of year-end economic conditions was assumed. The
calculations were based on estimates of proved reserves, which are revised over time as new data becomes available. Probable or
possible reserves, which may become proved in the future, were not considered. The calculations also require assumptions as to the
timing of future production of proved reserves and the timing and amount of future development costs, including dismantlement, and
future production costs, including taxes other than income taxes.

While due care was taken in its preparation, we do not represent that this data is the fair value of our oil and gas properties, or a fair
estimate of the present value of cash flows to be obtained from their development and production.

*Undiscounted future net cash flows related to the proved oil and gas reserves disclosed for Canada for the year ending December 31, 2020, are negative due to the
inclusion of asset retirement costs and certain indirect costs in the calculation of the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows. These costs are not
required to be included in the economic limit test for proved developed reserves as defined in Regulation S-X Rule 4-10. Future net cash flows for Canada were also
impacted by lower 12-month average pricing for bitumen and crude oil in 2020. Commodity prices have since improved in the current environment.

ROYALE ENERGY, INC.

PART I

Item 1 Description of Business

Royale Energy, Inc. (“Royale” or the “Company”) is an independent oil and natural gas producer incorporated under the laws of Delaware.
Royale’s principal lines of business are the production and sale of oil and natural gas, acquisition of oil and gas lease interests and proved
reserves, drilling of both exploratory and development wells, and sales of fractional working interests in wells to be drilled by Royale. Royale was
incorporated in Delaware in 2017 and is the successor by merger (as described below) to Royale Energy Funds, Inc., a California corporation
formed in 1983. On December 31, 2021, Royale and its consolidated subsidiaries had 11 full time employees.

RMX Joint Venture

On April 4, 2018, RMX Resources, LLC (“RMX”), CIC RMX LP (“CIC”), and Royale Energy Funds, Inc., (“REF”), and Matrix Oil
Management Corporation (“Matrix”), entered into a Subscription and Contribution Agreement (the “Contribution Agreement”) and certain other
agreements contemplated therein (the “Transaction”). The Contribution Agreement provided that Royale, REF and Matrix would contribute
certain assets to RMX, a newly formed Texas limited liability company. In exchange for its contributed assets, Royale received a 20% equity
interest in RMX, an equity performance incentive interest and $20.0 million to satisfy Matrix’s current senior lender, Arena Limited SPV, LLC, in
full, and to pay REF, Matrix and Royale’s trade payables and other outstanding obligations. CIC contributed an aggregate of $25.0 million in cash
to RMX in exchange for (i) an 80% equity interest in RMX, with preferred distributions until certain thresholds are met, (ii) a warrant (“Warrant”)
to acquire up to 4,000,000 shares of Royale’s common stock at an exercise price of $0.01 per share and registration rights pursuant to a
Registration Rights Agreement.

Royale Business

Royale and its subsidiaries own wells, leases, and proved and non-proved reserves of oil and gas located mainly in Mitchell County, Texas and in
the Sacramento Basin and San Joaquin Basin in California, as well as in Utah, Oklahoma, Louisiana and Colorado. Royale also owns an
overriding royalty interest in a discovery in Alaska. Royale usually sells a portion of the working interest in each well it drills or participates in to
third-party participants and retains a portion of the prospect for its own account. Selling part of the working interest to others allows Royale to
reduce its drilling risk by owning a diversified inventory of properties with less of its own funds invested in each drilling prospect, than if Royale
owned all the working interest and paid all drilling and development costs of each prospect itself. Royale generally sells working interests in its
prospects to accredited investors in exempt securities offerings. The prospects are typically bundled into multi-well investments, which permit the
third-party investors to diversify their investments by investing in several wells at once instead of investing in single well prospects.

During its fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, Royale continued to explore and develop oil and natural gas properties with concentration in
California and Texas. In 2021, Royale drilled and completed two wells, both of which were commercially productive. Royale’s estimated total
reserves were approximately 10.8 and 11.9 BCFE (billion cubic feet equivalent) at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. According to the
reserve reports furnished by Netherland, Sewell & Associates, Inc., Royale’s independent petroleum engineers, the net reserve value of its proved
developed and undeveloped reserves was approximately $42.1 million at December 31, 2021, based on the average Henry Hub natural gas price
spot price of $3.598 per MCF and for oil volumes, the average West Texas Intermediate price of $66.55 per barrel as applied on a field-by-field
basis. Netherland, Sewell & Associates, Inc. supplied reserve value estimates for the Company’s California, Texas, Oklahoma, and Utah
properties.

                                                                            4

Net reserve value does not represent the fair market value of our reserves on that date, and we cannot be sure what return we will eventually
receive on our reserves. Net reserve value of proved developed and undeveloped reserves was calculated by subtracting estimated future
development costs, future production costs and other operating expenses from estimated net future cash flows from our developed and
undeveloped reserves.

Our standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows at December 31, 2021, was estimated to be $16,281,919. This figure was calculated
by subtracting our estimated future income tax expense from the net reserve value of proved developed and undeveloped reserves, and by further
applying a 10% annual discount for estimated timing of cash flows. A detailed calculation of our standardized measure of discounted future net
cash flow is contained in Note 19 to our Financial Statements, Supplemental Information about Oil and Gas Producing Activities (Unaudited) –
Changes in Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flow from Proved Reserve Quantities.

Royale reported a loss on turnkey drilling in connection with the drilling of wells on a “turnkey contract” basis in the amount of $64,468 for the
year ended December 31, 2021. For the year ended December 31, 2020, Royale reported a gain on turnkey drilling in the amount of $1,700,462.

In addition to Royale’s own staff, Royale hires independent contractors to drill, test, complete and equip the wells that it drills. Approximately
98.1% of Royale’s total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021, came from sales of oil and natural gas from production of its wells in the
amount of $1,686,424. In 2020, this amount was $1,542,803, which represented 97.2% of Royale’s total revenues for the respective periods
presented. See Note 2 to our Financial Statements.

Plan of Business

Royale acquires interests in oil and natural gas reserves and sponsors private joint ventures. Royale believes that its stockholders are better served
by diversification of its investments among individual drilling prospects. Through its sale of joint ventures, Royale can acquire interests and
develop oil and natural gas properties with greater diversification of risk and still receive an interest in the revenues and reserves produced from
these properties. By selling some of its working interest in most projects, Royale decreases the amount of its investment required in the projects
and diversifies its oil and gas property holdings, to reduce the risk of concentrating a large amount of its capital in a few projects that may not be
successful.

After acquiring the leases or lease participation, Royale drills or participates in the drilling of development and exploratory oil and natural gas
wells on its property. Royale pays its proportionate share of the actual cost of drilling, testing, and completing the project to the extent that it
retains all or any portion of the working interest.

Royale also may sell fractional working interests in undeveloped wells to finance part of the drilling cost. A drilling contract that calls for a
company to drill a well, for a fixed price, to a specified depth or geological formation is called a “turnkey contract.” When Royale sells fractional
working interests in undeveloped property to raise capital to drill oil and natural gas wells, generally it agrees to drill these wells on a turnkey
contract basis, so that the holders of the fractional interests prepay a fixed amount for the drilling and completion of a specified number of wells.
Under a turnkey contract, Royale may record a gain if total funds received to drill a well were more than the actual cost to drill those wells
including costs incurred on behalf of the participants and costs incurred for its own account.

Although Royale’s operating agreements do not usually address whether investors have a right to participate in subsequent wells in the same area
of interest as a proposed well, it is the Company’s policy to offer to investors in a successful well the right to participate in subsequent wells at the
same percentage level as their working interest investment in the prior successful well.

Our policy for turnkey drilling agreements is to recognize a gain on turnkey drilling programs after our obligations have been fulfilled, and a gain
is only recorded when funds received from participants are in excess of all costs Royale incurs during the drilling programs (e.g., lease
acquisition, exploration and development costs), including costs incurred on behalf of participants and costs incurred for its own account. See
Note 1 to our Financial Statements, at page F-10.

Once commenced, drilling is generally completed within 10-30 days. Royale maintains internal records of the expenditure of each investor’s
funds for drilling projects.

                                                                           5

Royale generally operates the wells it completes. As operator, it receives fees set by industry standards from the owners of fractional interests in
the wells and from expense reimbursements. For the year ended December 31, 2021, Royale charged overhead from operation of the wells in the
amount of $311,754 for the year, which were an offset to general and administrative expenses. In 2020, the amount was $305,900. At December
31, 2021, Royale operated wells in California and Texas. Royale also has non-operating interests in wells in California, Utah, Texas, Oklahoma
and Colorado.

Royale currently sells most of its California natural gas production through Pacific Gas & Electric (“PG&E”) pipelines to independent customers
on a monthly contract basis, while some gas is delivered through privately owned pipelines to independent customers. Since many users are
willing to make such purchase arrangements, the loss of any one customer would not affect our overall sales operations.

All oil and natural gas properties are depleting assets in which production naturally decreases over time as the finite amount of existing reserves
are produced and sold. It is Royale’s business as an oil and natural gas exploration and production company to continually search for new
development properties. The Company’s success will ultimately depend on its ability to continue locating and developing new oil and natural gas
resources. Oil demand is subject to global demand and prices can fluctuate widely. In early 2020, oil prices dropped precipitously, and have since
returned to pre-COVID-19 2020 levels. The future market is likely to be subject to continued similar price dynamics. Natural gas demand and the
prices paid for gas are seasonal. In recent years, natural gas demand and prices in Northern California have fluctuated unpredictably throughout
the year.

Competition, Markets and Regulation

Competition

The exploration and production of oil and natural gas is an intensely competitive industry. The sale of interests in oil and gas projects, like those
Royale sells, is also very competitive. Royale encounters competition from other oil and natural gas producers, as well as from other entities that
invest in oil and gas for their own account or for others, and many of these companies are substantially larger than Royale.

Markets

Market factors affect the quantities of oil and natural gas production and the price Royale can obtain for the production from its oil and natural
gas properties. Such factors include: the extent of domestic production; the level of imports of foreign oil and natural gas; the general level of
market demand on a regional, national and worldwide basis; domestic and foreign economic conditions that determine levels of industrial
production; political events in foreign oil-producing regions; and variations in governmental regulations including environmental, energy
conservation, and tax laws or the imposition of new regulatory requirements upon the oil and natural gas industry.

Regulation

Federal and state laws and regulations affect, to some degree, the production, transportation, and sale of oil and natural gas from Royale’s
operations. States in which Royale operates have statutory provisions regulating the production and sale of oil and natural gas, including
provisions regarding deliverability. These statutes, along with the regulations interpreting the statutes, generally are intended to prevent waste of
oil and natural gas, and to protect correlative rights to produce oil and natural gas by assigning allowable rates of production to each well or
proration unit.

The exploration, development, production and processing of oil and natural gas are subject to various federal and state laws and regulations to
protect the environment. Various federal and state agencies are considering, and some have adopted, other laws and regulations regarding
environmental controls that could increase the cost of doing business. These laws and regulations may require: the acquisition of permits by
operators before drilling commences; the prohibition of drilling activities on certain lands lying within wilderness areas or where pollution arises;
and the imposition of substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from drilling operations, particularly operations in offshore waters or on
submerged lands. The cost of oil and natural gas development and production also may increase because of the cost of compliance with such
legislation and regulations, together with any penalties resulting from failing to comply with the legislation and regulations. Ultimately, Royale
may bear some of these costs.

Presently, Royale does not hold any undeveloped federal acreage on which it had plans to drill, and does not anticipate that compliance with
federal, state and local environmental regulations will have a material adverse effect on capital expenditures, earnings, or its competitive position
in the oil and natural gas industry; however, changes in the laws, rules or regulations, or the interpretation thereof, could have a materially adverse
effect on Royale’s financial condition or results of operation.

                                                                          6

Item 1A Risk Factors

As a smaller reporting company, as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act, Royale is not required to provide the information required by this
Item.

Item 2 Description of Property

Since 1993, Royale had concentrated on development of properties in the Sacramento Basin and the San Joaquin Basin of Northern and Central
California, in the last few it has moved its focus to Southern California in the Los Angeles Basin and in Mitchell County, Texas. In 2021, Royale
drilled two developmental oil wells in Texas and at year end 2021 was in process of drilling two oil wells in Texas and participating in the drilling
of two oil wells in southern California.

Following industry standards, Royale generally acquires oil and natural gas acreage without warranty of title except as to claims made by, though,
or under the transferor. In these cases, Royale attempts to conduct due diligence as to title before the acquisition, but it cannot assure that there
will be no losses resulting from title defects or from defects in the assignment of leasehold rights. Title to property most often carries
encumbrances, such as royalties, overriding royalties, carried and other similar interests, and contractual obligations, all of which are customary
within the oil and natural gas industry.

Following is a discussion of Royale’s significant oil and natural gas properties. Reserves at December 31, 2021, for each property discussed
below, have been determined by Netherland, Sewell & Associates, Inc., registered professional petroleum engineers, in accordance with reports
submitted to Royale on February 16, 2022.

California

Royale owns interests in nine gas fields with locations ranging throughout the Sacramento Basin in California. At December 31, 2021, Royale
operated 12 wells and owns interests in 19 non-operated wells in Northern California and 6 non-operated wells in Southern and Central
California. Our California estimated total proven, developed, and undeveloped net reserves are approximately 0.717 BCFE, according to Royale’s
independently prepared reserve report as of December 31, 2021.

Texas

At December 31, 2021, Royale owned and operated interests in 46 wells in its Jameson field. Our Texas estimated total proven, developed, and
undeveloped net reserves are approximately 454.1 MBOE, according to Royale’s independently prepared reserve report as of December 31, 2021.

Drilling Activities

The following table sets forth Royale’s drilling activities during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. All wells are located in the
Continental U.S., in California, Texas, Louisiana, Colorado and Utah.

a) An exploratory well is one that is drilled in search of new oil and natural gas reservoirs, or to test the boundary limits of a previously
discovered reservoir. A developmental well is one drilled on a previously known productive area of an oil and natural gas reservoir with the
objective of completing that reservoir.

b) Gross wells represent the number of actual wells in which Royale owns an interest. Royale’s interest in these wells may range from 1% to
100%.

c) A producing well is one that produces oil and/or natural gas that is being purchased on the market.

d) A dry well is a well that is not deemed capable of producing hydrocarbons in paying, marketable, quantities.

e) One “net well” is deemed to exist when the sum of fractional ownership working interests in gross wells or acres equals one. The number of net
wells is the sum of the fractional working interests owned in gross wells expressed as a whole number or a fraction.

Production

The following table summarizes, for the years indicated, Royale’s net share of oil and natural gas production, average sales price per barrel
(BBL), per thousand cubic feet (MCF) of natural gas, and the MCF equivalent (MCFE) for the barrels of oil based on a 6 to 1 ratio of the price
per barrel of oil to the price per MCF of natural gas. “Net” production is production that Royale owns either directly or indirectly through
partnership or joint venture interests produced to its interest after deducting royalty, limited partner or other similar interests. Royale generally
sells its oil and natural gas at prices then prevailing on the “spot market” and does not have any material long term contracts for the sale of natural
gas at a fixed price.

Reserve Estimates

Management has established, and is responsible for, internal controls designed to provide reasonable assurance that the estimates of Proved
Reserves are computed and reported in accordance with rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC as well as established industry practices
used by independent engineering firms and our peers. These internal controls include documented process workflows and qualified professional
engineering and geological personnel with specific reservoir experience. Our internal processes and controls surrounding this process are
routinely tested. We also retain outside independent engineering firms to prepare estimates of our Proved Reserves. Management reviews and
approves our reserve estimates, whether prepared internally or by third parties. Our Chief Executive Officer oversaw our outside independent
engineering firm, Netherland, Sewell & Associates, Inc. ("NSAI"), in connection with the preparation of their estimates of our Proved Reserves as
of December 31, 2021. We also regularly communicate with NSAI throughout the year regarding technical and operational matters critical to our
reserve estimations. Our Chief Executive Officer, with input from other members of management, is responsible for the selection of our third-
party engineering firms and review of the reports generated. Our Chief Executive Officer has over 37 years of experience in the oil and natural
gas industry and is a graduate of the University of Oklahoma with a degree in Chemical Engineering. During his career, he has had various
relevant responsibilities in technical and leadership roles including asset management, drilling and completions, production engineering, reservoir
engineering and reserves management, economic evaluations and field development in U.S. onshore projects. The third-party engineering reports
are also provided to the Audit Committee.

As of December 31, 2021, Royale had proved developed reserves of 939,100 MCF and total proved reserves of 1,354,300 MCF of natural gas.
For the same period, Royale also had proved developed oil and natural gas liquid combined reserves of 193,000 BBL and total proved oil and
natural gas liquid combined reserves of 1,579,100 BBL.

As of December 31, 2020, Royale had proved developed reserves of 691,900 MCF and total proved reserves of 2,660,500 MCF of natural gas.
For the same period, Royale also had proved developed oil and natural gas liquid combined reserves of 224,893 BBL and total proved oil and
natural gas liquid combined reserves of 1,541,000 BBL.

During 2021, our overall proved developed and undeveloped natural gas reserves decreased by 49.1% and our previously estimated proved
developed and undeveloped natural gas reserve quantities were revised downward by approximately 1.9 million cubic feet of natural gas. This
downward revision was mainly the result of a decrease in proved undeveloped natural gas reserves from drilling locations which the Company
had previously estimated.

Oil and gas reserve estimates and the discounted present value estimates associated with the reserve estimates are based on numerous engineering,
geological and operational assumptions that generally are derived from limited data.

Item 7 Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Management’s Discussion and Analysis is the Company’s analysis of its financial performance and of significant trends that may affect future
performance. It should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes, and supplemental oil and gas disclosures included
elsewhere in this report. It contains forward-looking statements including, without limitation, statements relating to the Company’s plans,
strategies, objectives, expectations and intentions that are made pursuant to the “safe harbor” provisions of the Private Securities Litigation
Reform Act of 1995. Readers are cautioned that such forward-looking statements should be read in conjunction with the Company’s disclosures
under the heading: “Cautionary Statement about Forward-Looking Statements” in this Annual Report.

Overview

Royale is an independent oil and natural gas producer. Royale’s principal lines of business are the production and sale of oil and natural gas,
acquisition of oil and gas lease interests and proved reserves, drilling of both exploratory and development wells, and sales of fractional working
interests in wells to be drilled by Royale. Since 1993, Royale has primarily acquired and developed producing and non-producing natural gas
properties in California. In December 2018, Royale became the operator of a newly acquired field in Texas. The most significant factors affecting
the results of operations are (i) changes in oil and natural gas prices, production levels and reserves, (ii) turnkey drilling activities, and (iii) the
increase in future cost associated with abandonment of wells.

During 2021, as the economy and travel picked up as a result of reduced travel restrictions and stay at home orders, we saw an increase in
commodity prices of oil and natural gas above pre-pandemic levels. Although, we did continue to see supply chain issues and labor shortages
impact the oil and natural gas industry. These supply chain issues and labor shortages would eventually lead to delays in drilling during the year
in 2021, and increased costs of goods and services.

                                                                           10

Critical Accounting Policies

Revenue Recognition

Royale’s primary business is oil and gas production. Natural gas flows from the wells into gathering line systems, which are equipped
occasionally with compressor systems, which in turn flow into metered transportation and customer pipelines. Monthly, price data and daily
production are used to invoice customers for amounts due to Royale and other working interest owners. Royale operates most of its own wells
and receives industry standard operator fees (“Supervisory Fees”). Supervisory Fees are recognized as a reduction to the Company’s General and
Administrative Expenses.

Royale generally sells crude oil and natural gas under short-term agreements at prevailing market prices. Revenues are recognized when the
products are delivered, which occurs when the customer has taken title and has assumed the risks and rewards of ownership, prices are fixed or
determinable and collectability is reasonably assured.

Revenues from the production of oil and natural gas properties in which the Royale has an interest with other producers are recognized on the
basis of Royale’s net working interest. Differences between actual production and net working interest volumes are not significant.

The Company’s Financial Statements include its pro rata ownership of wells. The Company usually sells a portion of the working interest in each
well it drills or participates in to third-party participants and retains a portion of the prospect for its own account. All results, successful or not, are
included at its pro rata ownership amounts: revenue, expenses, assets, and liabilities as defined in FASB ASC 932-323-25 and 932-360.

Equity Method Investments

Investments in entities over which the Company has significant influence, but not control, are accounted for using the equity method of
accounting. Income from equity method investments represents Royale’s proportionate share of net income generated by the equity method.
Equity method investments are included as noncurrent assets on the consolidated balance sheet.

Equity method investments are assessed for impairment whenever changes in the facts and circumstances indicate a loss in value may have
occurred. When a loss is deemed to have occurred and is other than temporary, the carrying value of the equity method investment is written
down to fair value, and the amount of the write-down is included in income.

Business Combinations

From time-to-time, the Company acquires businesses in the oil and gas industry. Businesses are included in the Company’s consolidated financial
statements from the date of acquisition. We recognize, separately from goodwill, the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their
estimated acquisition-date fair values. We measure and recognize goodwill as of the acquisition date as the excess of: (1) the aggregate of the fair
value of consideration transferred, the fair value of any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree (if any) and the acquisition date fair value of our
previously held equity interest in the acquiree (if any), over (2) the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. If information about facts
and circumstances existing as of the acquisition date is incomplete by the end of the reporting period in which a business combination occurs, we
report provisional amounts for the items for which the accounting is incomplete. The measurement or allocation period ends once we receive the
information we are seeking; however, this period will generally not exceed one year from the acquisition date. Any material adjustments
recognized during the measurement period will be reflected retrospectively in the consolidated financial statements of the subsequent period. We
recognize third-party transaction-related costs as expense currently in the period in which they are incurred.

Oil and Gas Property and Equipment

Depreciation, depletion and amortization, based on cost less estimated salvage value of the asset, are primarily determined under either the unit-
of-production method or the straight-line method, which is based on estimated asset service life taking obsolescence into consideration.
Maintenance and repairs, including planned major maintenance, are expensed as incurred. Major renewals and improvements are capitalized and
the assets replaced are retired.

The project construction phase commences with the development of the detailed engineering design and ends when the constructed assets are
ready for their intended use. Interest costs, to the extent they are incurred to finance expenditures during the construction phase, are included in
property, plant and equipment and are depreciated over the service life of the related assets.

                                                                            11

Royale uses the “successful efforts” method to account for its exploration and production activities. Under this method, Royale accumulates its
proportionate share of costs on a well-by-well basis with certain exploratory expenditures and exploratory dry holes being expensed as incurred,
and capitalizes expenditures for productive wells. Royale amortizes the costs of productive wells under the unit-of-production method.

Royale carries, as an asset, exploratory well costs when the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify its completion as a producing
well and where Royale is making sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project. Exploratory
well costs not meeting these criteria are charged to expense. Other exploratory expenditures, including geophysical costs and annual lease rentals,
are expensed as incurred.

Acquisition costs of proved properties are amortized using a unit-of-production method, computed on the basis of total proved oil and gas
reserves.

Capitalized exploratory drilling and development costs associated with productive depletable extractive properties are amortized using unit-of-
production rates based on the amount of proved developed reserves of oil and gas that are estimated to be recoverable from existing facilities
using current operating methods. Under the unit-of-production method, oil and gas volumes are considered produced once they have been
measured through meters at custody transfer or sales transaction points at the outlet valve on the lease or field storage tank.

Production costs are expensed as incurred. Production involves lifting the oil and gas to the surface and gathering, treating, field processing and
field storage of the oil and gas. The production function normally terminates at the outlet valve on the lease or field production storage tank.
Production costs are those incurred to operate and maintain Royale’s wells and related equipment and facilities. They become part of the cost of
oil and gas produced. These costs, sometimes referred to as lifting costs, include such items as labor costs to operate the wells and related
equipment; repair and maintenance costs on the wells and equipment; materials, supplies and energy costs required to operate the wells and
related equipment; and administrative expenses related to the production activity. Proved oil and gas properties held and used by Royale are
reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable.

Royale estimates the future undiscounted cash flows of the affected properties to judge the recoverability of carrying amounts. Cash flows used in
impairment evaluations are developed using annually updated evaluation assumptions for crude oil commodity prices. Annual volumes are based
on field production profiles, which are also updated annually. Prices for natural gas and other products are based on assumptions developed
annually for evaluation purposes.

Impairment analyses are generally based on proved reserves. An asset group would be impaired if the undiscounted cash flows were less than its’
carrying value. Impairments are measured by the amount the carrying value exceeds fair value. During 2021 and 2020, impairment losses of
$177,011 and $0, respectively, were recorded on various capitalized lease and land costs where the carrying value exceeded the fair value or
where the leases were no longer viable.

Significant unproved properties are assessed for impairment individually, and valuation allowances against the capitalized costs are recorded
based on the estimated economic chance of success and the length of time that Royale expects to hold the properties. The valuation allowances
are reviewed at least annually.

Upon the sale or retirement of a complete field of a proved property, Royale eliminates the cost from its books, and the resultant gain or loss is
recorded to Royale’s Statement of Operations. Upon the sale of an entire interest in an unproved property where the property has been assessed
for impairment individually, a gain or loss is recognized in Royale’s Statement of Operations. If a partial interest in an unproved property is sold,
any funds received are accounted for as a recovery of the cost in the interest retained with any excess funds recognized as a gain. Should Royale’s
turnkey drilling agreements include unproved property, total drilling costs incurred to satisfy its obligations are recovered by the total funds
received under the agreements. Any excess funds are recorded as a Gain on Turnkey Drilling Programs, and any costs not recovered are
capitalized and accounted for under the “successful efforts” method.

The Company sponsors turnkey drilling agreement arrangements in properties as a pooling of assets in a joint undertaking, whereby proceeds
from participants are reported as Deferred Drilling Obligations, and then reduced as costs to complete its obligations are incurred with any excess
booked against its property account to reduce any basis in its own interest. Gains on Turnkey Drilling Programs represent funds received from
turnkey drilling participants in excess of all costs Royale incurs during the drilling programs (e.g., lease acquisition, exploration and development
costs), including costs incurred on behalf of participants and costs incurred for its own account; and are recognized only upon making this
determination after Royale’s obligations have been fulfilled.

                                                                         12
Table of Contents

The contracts require the participants to pay Royale the full contract price upon execution of the agreement. Royale completes the drilling
activities typically between 10 and 30 days after drilling begins. The participant retains an undivided or proportional beneficial interest in the
property, and is also responsible for their proportionate share of operating costs. Royale retains legal title to the lease. The participants purchase a
working interest directly in the well bore.

In these working interest arrangements, the participants are responsible for sharing in the risk of development, but also sharing in a proportional
interest in rights to revenues and proportional liability for the cost of operations after drilling is completed.

Since the participant’s interest in the prospect is limited to the well, and not the lease, the participant does not have a legal right to participate in
additional wells drilled within the same lease. However, it is the Company’s policy to offer to participants in a successful well the right to
participate in subsequent wells at the same percentage level as their working interest investment in the prior successful well with similar turnkey
drilling agreement terms.

A certain portion of the turnkey drilling participant’s funds received are non-refundable. The Company records a liability for all funds invested as
deferred drilling obligations until each individual well is complete. Occasionally, drilling is delayed for various reasons such as weather,
permitting, drilling rig availability and/or contractual obligations. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, Royale had deferred drilling obligations of
$7,824,939 and $3,127,500 respectively.

If Royale is unable to drill the wells, and a suitable replacement well is not found, Royale would retain the non-refundable portion of the contract
and return the remaining funds to the participant. Included in cash and cash equivalents are amounts for use in completion of turnkey drilling
programs in progress.

Losses on properties sold are recognized when incurred or when the properties are held for sale and the fair value of the properties is less than the
carrying value.

Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The most
significant estimates pertain to proved oil, plant products and gas reserve volumes and the future development costs. Actual results could differ
from those estimates.

Deferred Income Taxes

Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects, calculated at currently enacted rates, of (a) future deductible/taxable amounts attributable to
events that have been recognized on a cumulative basis in the financial statements or income tax returns, and (b) operating loss and tax credit
carry forwards. All available evidence, both positive and negative, must be considered to determine whether, based on the weight of that
evidence, a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is needed. The Company uses information about the Company’s financial position and its
results of operations for the current and preceding years.

The Company must use its judgment in considering the relative impact of negative and positive evidence. The weight given to the potential effect
of negative and positive evidence is commensurate with the extent to which it can be objectively verified. The more negative evidence that exists,
the more positive evidence is necessary and the more difficult it is to support a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not needed for some
portion or all of the deferred tax asset. A cumulative loss in recent years is a significant piece of negative evidence that is difficult to overcome.

Future realization of a tax benefit sometimes will be expected for a portion, but not all, of a deferred tax asset, and the dividing line between the
two portions may be unclear. In those circumstances, application of judgment based on a careful assessment of all available evidence is required
to determine the portion of a deferred tax asset for which it is more-likely-than-not a tax benefit will not be realized.

Going Concern

At December 31, 2021, the Company has an accumulated deficit of $86,685,036, a working capital deficiency of $6,797,815 and a stockholders’
deficit of $32,570,243. As a result, our financial statements include a “going concern qualification” reflecting substantial doubt as to our ability to
continue as a going concern. See Note 1 to our audited financial statements. We do not possess funds necessary to implement our 2022 budget.
Royale is continuing its drilling efforts with its direct working interest owners. In addition, we are exploring commitments to provide additional
financing, but there is no guarantee that we will be able to secure additional financing on acceptable terms, or at all, needed to fully fund our 2022
drilling budget and to support future operations.

Results of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2021, as Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2020

For the year ended December 31, 2021, we had a net loss of $3,598,418 compared to the net loss of $8,148,147 during the year in 2020. The table
below reflects the major components of other income and expense.

                                                                                                  Year Ended December 31,
                                                                                                  2021              2020

               Loss Before Income Tax Expense                                             $         (3,598,418) $          (8,148,147)

In 2021, the majority of the loss resulted from a loss from operations of $3,666,161. In 2020, the majority of the net loss resulted from a
$6,185,995 impairment of our investment in RMX Resources, LLC, due to year end 2020 reserve valuations and other considerations, see Note 2
to our Financial Statements.

During the year ended 2021, revenues from oil and gas production increased $143,621 or 9.3% to $1,686,424 from the 2020 revenues of
$1,542,803. This increase was due to higher commodity prices realized for the sale of oil and gas in 2021. The net sales volume of oil for the year
ended December 31, 2021 was approximately 18,963 barrels of oil with an average price of $65.28 versus approximately 31,210 barrels with an
average price of $37.96 per barrel, for the year in 2020. This represents a decrease in net sales volume of approximately 12,247 barrels or 39.2%.
The net sales volume of natural gas for the year ended December 31, 2021, was approximately 122,151 Mcf with an average price of $3.64 per
Mcf, versus 160,406 Mcf with an average price of $2.23 per Mcf for the year in 2020. This represents a decrease in net sales volume of
approximately 38,255 Mcf or 23.8%. The decreases in oil and natural gas production volumes were due to the 2021 sales of non-operated wells in
East Los Angeles and Texas and to lower volumes on existing wells due to natural declines.

Oil and natural gas lease operating expenses increased by $416,970 or 29.8%, to $1,814,643 for the year ended December 31, 2021, from
$1,397,673 for the year in 2020. This was higher in 2021 due to increases in plugging and abandonment by an industry partner of certain non-
operated California wells and workover costs of wells in our Texas Jameson field to increase production. When measuring lease operating costs
on a production or lifting cost basis, in 2021, the $1,814,643 equates to a $7.69 per Mcfe lifting cost versus a $4.02 per Mcfe lifting cost in 2020,
due to higher lease operating costs and lower production volumes in 2021.

The aggregate of Supervisory Fees and other income was $32,240 for year ended December 31, 2021, a decrease of $12,812 or 28.4% from
$45,052 during the year in 2020. This decrease was mainly due to lower pipeline and compressor fee income due to lower production volumes
during 2021.

Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense increased to $537,273 from $473,647, an increase of $63,626 or 13.4% for the year ended
December 31, 2021, as compared to the year in 2020. The depletion rate is calculated using production by comparing capitalized cost to the
recoverable reserves remaining. This increase in depreciation expense was due to a decrease in expected recoverable reserves which increased the
depletion rate.

General and administrative expenses decreased by $158,149 or 7.5% from $2,109,232 for the year ended December 31, 2020, to $1,951,083 for
the year ended 2021. This decrease was due to lower employee related expenses and office rents along with lower property tax payments in 2021
as we received pre-merger disputed property tax billings in 2020. Legal and accounting expense increased to $419,587 for the year in 2021,
compared to $279,227 for the year in 2020, a $140,360 or 50.3% increase. This increase was primarily due to higher audit related expenses during
2021. Marketing expense for the year ended December 31, 2021, increased $116,732, or 102.7%, to $230,346, compared to $113,614 for the year
in 2020. Marketing expense varies from period to period according to the number of marketing events attended by personnel and their associated
costs. During 2020 fewer marketing events were attended as the governmental mandate against large gatherings was implemented.

                                                                         14

At December 31, 2021, Royale had a Deferred Drilling Obligation of $7,824,939. During 2021, we disposed of $1,841,061 of drilling obligations
upon completing the drilling of two oil wells in Texas, while incurring expenses of $1,905,529, resulting in a loss of $64,468. At December 31,
2020, Royale had a Deferred Drilling Obligation of $3,127,500. During 2020, we disposed of $6,432,675 of drilling obligations upon completing
the drilling of five oil wells, three in California and two in Texas, while incurring expenses of $4,732,213, resulting in a gain of $1,700,462.

During the year in 2021, we recorded a loss of $253,956 on sale of asset upon the sale of certain non-operated California properties which was
completed during the third quarter of 2021. We also recorded a gain of $318,834 on the sale of asset upon the sale of certain non-operated Texas
properties which was completed during the second quarter of 2021. In both sales, these non-operated properties were originally acquired during
the 2018 merger with Matrix and booked as Held for Sale at the end of 2020, which resulted in a net gain on sale of assets of $64,878 in 2021.
During the first quarter of 2021, we recorded a gain on settlement of $10,061 due to the payment by the Small Business Administration (“SBA”)
of the remaining balance of our PPP loan obtained in 2020. During the year in 2020, as disclosed above, we recorded a loss of $6,185,995, on the
impairment of our investment in joint venture of RMX Resources, LLC. During the fourth quarter we recorded a loss on assets held for sale of
$566,858, in anticipation of the sale of certain oil and gas assets during the year in 2021. During the third quarter in 2020, we recorded a gain on
other of $271,310 based on the contract agreement with an industry partner in the drilling of two wells. During the year in 2020, we also recorded
a gain on other of $280,596 on the receipt of a pre-Matrix merger prepayment refunds. During the year in 2020, we recorded a gain on settlement
of $197,800 on the forgiveness of our SBA Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”) loan (discussed further in Note 16 to our Financial Statements)
and a loss on settlement of $31,500 related to a 2018 seismic sales agreement. During the year in 2020, we recorded geological and geophysical
expense of $14,392 related costs in our Texas Jameson field. We periodically review our proved properties for impairment on a field-by-field
basis and charge impairments of value to the expense. During 2021, we recorded lease impairments of $177,011 on various lease and land costs in
our California natural gas fields where the carrying value exceeded the fair value, no lease impairments were recorded in 2020.

Bad debt expense for 2021 and 2020 were $190,414 and $1,008,003, respectively. Approximately $180,000 of the expenses in 2021 and $800,000
of the expenses in 2020 arose from identified uncollectable receivables relating to our oil and natural gas properties either plugged and abandoned
or scheduled for plugging and abandonment and our year-end oil and natural gas reserve values. During the year in 2020, the other bad debt
expense of approximately $203,000 was related to revenue receivable from an industry partner whose collectability was in doubt. We periodically
review our accounts receivable from working interest owners to determine whether collection of any of these charges appears doubtful. By
contract, the Company may not collect some charges from its Direct Working Interest owners for certain wells that ceased production or had been
sold during the year, to the extent that these charges exceed production revenue.

Interest expense decreased to $9,206 for the year ended December 31, 2021, from $12,949 in 2020, a $3,743 decrease. This decrease was mainly
due to lower principal balances on notes payable during the year in 2021.

In 2021 and 2020, we did not have an income tax expense due to the use of a percentage depletion carryover valuation allowance created from the
current and past operations resulting in an effective tax rate less than the new federal rate of 21% plus the relevant state rates (mostly California,
8.8%).

Capital Resources and Liquidity

At December 31, 2021, Royale had current assets totaling $7,684,808 and current liabilities totaling $14,482,623, a $6,797,815 working capital
deficit. We had cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2021 of $220,304 and restricted cash of $4,002,500 compared to cash and cash
equivalents of $255,112 and restricted cash of $2,146,571 at December 31, 2020.

Ordinarily, we fund our operations and cash needs from our available credit and cash flows generated from operations. We believe there is some
doubt that the Company has the ability to meet liquidity demands through cash-flow from operations. In that event, the Company will seek
alternative capital sources through additional sales of equity or debt securities, or the sale of property, which may not be available at all, or on
terms we deem reasonable.

At December 31, 2021, our other receivables net, which consist of joint interest billing receivables from direct working interest participants and
industry partners, totaled $413,133, compared to $462,777 at December 31, 2020, a $49,644 decrease. This decrease was mainly due to the
increase in accounts receivable allowance from direct working interest owners in 2021. At December 31, 2021, revenue receivable was $365,150,
an increase of $161,001, compared to $204,149 at December 31, 2020, due to higher commodity prices at year end 2021. At December 31, 2021,
our accounts payable and accrued expenses totaled $5,160,484, an increase of $999,375 from the accounts payable at December 31, 2020 of
$4,161,109, mainly due to drilling and lease operating costs in 2021.

We have not engaged in hedging activities nor do we use derivative instruments to manage market risks.

                                                                         15

Operating Activities. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, cash used in operating activities totaled $1,624,099 and $381,116,
respectively. This $1,242,983 increase in cash used was primarily due to the increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities during the period
in 2021 due to participating in the drilling of two Southern California oil wells at year end.

Investing Activities. Net cash provided by investing activities totaled $3,465,024 for the year ended December 31, 2021 versus net cash used by
investing activities of $1,235,485 for the year ended December 31, 2020. The difference was due to cash receipts of approximately $6.5 million in
2021 and $4.3 million in 2020 in direct working interest turnkey investments. Additionally, during 2021, we received approximately $1.07
million from the sale of non-operated properties in Texas and California. During 2021, our turnkey drilling expenditures were approximately $4.1
million as we drilled and completed two oil wells in Texas and were in process at year end of drilling two California oil wells and two Texas oil
wells. In 2020, our turnkey drilling expenditures were approximately $5.6 million as we drilled and completed five oil wells, three in California
and two in Texas.

Financing Activities. For the year ended December 31, 2021, net cash used by financing activities totaled $19,804 versus net cash provided by
financing activities of $141,755 for the year ended December 31, 2020. During 2021, we entered into an agreement in settlement of amounts due
at the end of our office lease for $38,490. In 2021, we also had note and financing lease payments of $58,294. During the year in 2020, we
received $207,800 in a PPP Loan, of which $197,800 was forgiven. We also had principal payments of approximately $66,000 on our notes
payable.

Changes in Reserve Estimates

During 2021, our overall proved developed and undeveloped natural gas reserves decreased by 49.1% and our previously estimated proved
developed and undeveloped natural gas reserve quantities were revised downward by approximately 1.9 million cubic feet of natural gas. This
downward revision was mainly the result of a decrease in proved undeveloped natural gas reserves from drilling locations which the Company
had previously estimated. See Note 19 - Supplemental Information about Oil and Gas Producing Activities (Unaudited), to our Financial
Statements.

During 2020, our overall proved developed and undeveloped natural gas reserves decreased by 38.2% and our previously estimated proved
developed and undeveloped natural gas reserve quantities were revised downward by approximately 1.5 million cubic feet of natural gas. This
downward revision was mainly the result of a decrease in proved developed natural gas reserves from a decrease in economic life of wells related
to a decrease in future expected product price. See Supplemental Information about Oil and Gas Producing Activities (Unaudited), Note 19 to our
Financial Statements.

Item 9 Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure

None

Item 9A Controls and Procedures

Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we
conducted an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) under the
Exchange Act. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls
and procedures were effective to give reasonable assurance that information required to be publicly disclosed is recorded, processed, summarized
and reported on a timely basis as of the end of the period covered by this annual report. Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over our financial reporting. In order to evaluate the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, management has conducted an
assessment, including testing, using the criteria in Internal Control-Integrated Framework, issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations
of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”). Our system of internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles.

Based on our evaluation under the framework in Internal Control-Integrated Framework, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer
concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of December 31, 2021 due to the material weakness that is
described below.

Material Weakness and Remediation

A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable
possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.

In connection with the audit of our 2019 consolidated financial statements, management had identified a material weakness that existed because
we did not maintain effective controls over our financial close and reporting process, and concluded that the financial close and reporting process
needed additional formal procedures to ensure there are appropriate reviews over all financial reporting analysis. Management has also identified
a material weakness that existed due to the lack of segregation of duties and controls, including user access, regarding our financial reporting
system. Updated procedures have been implemented through the close process for the year ended December 31, 2020, but the material weakness
on our financial close and reporting process was not alleviated. We will continue to monitor these throughout 2022 to be able to fully assess
whether the procedures and controls are effective.

Attestation Report of the Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm.

This annual report does not include an attestation report of the Company’s registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over
financial reporting. Management’s report was not subject to attestation by the registered public accounting firm pursuant to rules of the Securities
and Exchange Commission that permit the Company to provide only management’s report in this annual report.

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Other than the remedial activities described above, no changes in our internal control over financial reporting occurred during the year ended
December 31, 2021 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

                                                                          17

Compensation Discussion and Analysis

Our executive compensation policy is designed to motivate, reward and retain the key executive talent necessary to achieve our business
objectives and contribute to our long-term success. Our compensation policy for our executive officers focuses primarily on determining
appropriate salary levels and performance-based cash bonuses.

The elements of executive compensation at Royale consist mainly of cash salary and, if appropriate, a cash bonus at yearend. The compensation
committee makes recommendations to the board of directors annually on the compensation of the three top executives: Johnny Jordan, Chief
Executive Officer, Donald H. Hosmer, Business Development, and Stephen M. Hosmer, Chief Financial Officer.

Royale also does not provide extensive personal benefits to its executives beyond those benefits, such as health insurance, that are provided to all
employees. Donald Hosmer and Stephen Hosmer each receive an annual car allowance.

Policy

The compensation committee’s primary responsibility is making recommendations to the board of directors relating to compensation of our
officers. The committee also makes recommendations to the board of directors regarding employee benefits, our defined benefit plans, defined
contribution plans, and stock-based plans.

Determination

To determine executive compensation, the committee, from time-to-time, meets with our officers to review our compensation programs, discuss
the performance of the Company, the duties and responsibilities of each of the officers pay levels and business results compared to others
similarly situated within the industry. The committee then makes recommendations to the board of directors for any adjustment to the officers’
compensation levels. The committee does not employ compensation consultants to make recommendations on executive compensation.

Compensation Elements

Base. Base salaries for our executive officers are established based on the scope of their responsibilities, taking into account competitive market
compensation paid by our peers. Base salaries are reviewed annually. The salaries we paid to our most highly paid executive officers and next
most highly compensated non-executive officer for the last three years are set forth in the Summary Compensation Table included under
Executive Compensation.

Bonus. The compensation committee meets annually to determine the quantity, if any, of the cash bonuses of executive officers. The amount
granted is based, subjectively, upon the Company’s stock price performance, earnings, revenue, reserves and production. The committee does not
use quantifiable metrics for these criteria; but rather uses each in balance to assess the strength of the Company’s performance. The committee
believes that formulaic approaches to cash incentives can foster an unhealthy balance between short-term and long-term goals. No cash bonuses
were paid to executive officers in 2021 or 2020, other than those listed for Donald Hosmer in the table above.

Compensation of Directors

In 2021, board members or committee member accrued or received fees for attendance at board meetings or committee meetings during the year.
In addition to cash payments, Common Stock was issued in lieu of compensation or reimbursements. Royale also reimbursed directors for the
expenses incurred for their services.

The following table describes the compensation paid to our directors who are not also named executives for their services in 2021.

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of
Royale Energy, Inc.

Opinion on the Financial Statements

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Royale Energy, Inc. (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2021, and the related
statements of operations, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for the year then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the
“consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of the Company as of December 31, 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

Going Concern Uncertainty

The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As
discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has suffered recurring losses from operations and has a net capital
deficiency that raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management’s plans in regard to these matters are also
described in Note 1. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

Basis for Opinion

These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the entity’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
consolidated financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States) (“PCAOB”) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities
laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not
required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audit we are required to
obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the
entity’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.

Our audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud,
and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for
our opinion.

                                                                        F-2

Critical Audit Matters

The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were
communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the
financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters
does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters
below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.

Estimation of Proved Reserves Impacting the Recognition and Valuation of Depletion Expense and Impairment and Oil and Gas Properties

Critical Accounting Matter Description
As described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company accounts for its oil and gas properties using the successful efforts
method of accounting which requires management to make estimates of proved reserve volumes and future revenues and expenses to calculate
depletion expense and measure its oil and gas properties for potential impairment. To estimate the volume of proved reserves and future revenues,
management makes significant estimates and assumptions, including forecasting the production decline rate of producing properties and the
timing and volume of production associated with the Company’s development plan for proved undeveloped properties. In addition, the estimation
of proved reserves is also impacted by management’s judgments and estimates regarding the financial performance of wells associated with
proved reserves to determine if wells are expected, with reasonable certainty, to be economical under the appropriate pricing assumptions required
in the estimation of depletion expense and potential impairment measurements. We identified the estimation of proved reserves of oil and gas
properties, due to its impact on depletion expense and impairment evaluation, as a critical audit matter.

The principal consideration for our determination that the estimation of proved reserves is a critical audit matter is that changes in certain inputs
and assumptions, which require a high degree of subjectivity necessary to estimate the volume and future revenues of the Company’s proved
reserves could have a significant impact on the measurement of depletion expense or the impairment assessment. In turn, auditing those inputs
and assumptions required subjective and complex auditor judgement.

How the Critical Audit Matter was Addressed in the Audit
We obtained an understanding of the design and implementation of management’s controls related to the estimation of proved reserves by
evaluating the level of knowledge, skill, and ability of the Company’s reservoir engineering specialists and their relationship to the Company,
made inquiries of those reservoir engineers regarding the process followed and judgments made to estimate the Company’s proved reserve
volumes, and read the reserve report prepared by the Company’s specialists.

                                                                        F-3
The Board of Directors and Shareholders of
Royale Energy, Inc.


To the extent key, sensitive inputs and assumptions used to determine proved reserve volumes and other cash flow inputs and assumptions are
derived from Company’s accounting records, such as commodity pricing, historical pricing differentials, operating costs, estimated capital costs
and working and net revenue interests, we evaluated management’s process for determining the assumptions, including examining the underlying
support, on a sample basis. These audit procedures, among others included the following:

          ●   Compared the estimated pricing differentials used in the reserve report to realized prices related to revenue transactions recorded in
              the current year and examined contractual support for the pricing differentials;
          ●   Evaluated the models used to estimate the operating costs at year-end compared to historical operating costs;
          ●   Compared the models used to determine the future capital expenditures and compared estimated future capital expenditures used in
              the reserve report to amounts expended for recently drilled and completed wells with similar locations;
          ●   Evaluated the working and net revenue interests used in the reserve report by inspecting a sample of ownership interests, historical
              pricing differentials, and operating costs to underlying support from the Company’s accounting records;
          ●   Evaluated the Company’s evidence supporting the amount of proved undeveloped properties reflected in the reserve report by
              examining support for the Company’s or the operator’s ability and intent to develop the proved undeveloped properties;
          ●   Applied analytical procedures to the reserve report by comparing to historical actual results and to the prior year reserve report.

Deferred Drilling Obligation & Gain/Loss on Turnkey Drilling

Critical Accounting Matter Description
As described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company sponsors turnkey drilling agreement arrangements in proved and
unproved properties as a pooling of assets in a joint undertaking, whereby proceeds from participants are reported as Deferred Drilling
Obligations. That obligation is reduced as costs to complete are incurred, with any excess cost incurred booked against the Company’s property
account to reduce any basis in its own interest. Gain on Turnkey Drilling represents funds received from turnkey drilling participants in excess of
all costs the Company incurs during the drilling programs and is recognized only upon making the determination that the Company’s obligations
have been fulfilled. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, the Company’s Deferred Drilling Obligation was approximately $7.8 million,
and the Loss on Turnkey Drilling was $64,468.

                                                                        F-4

Royale Energy, Inc.


Company management applies significant estimation in determining the expected cost to drill a well and to develop the well site, and significant
judgment in determining when they have fulfilled their obligations under the Private Placement Memorandums triggering the recognition of
turnkey gain. Both factors may impact the amount and timing of the recognition of a turnkey gain and involve a high degree of auditor judgement
related to the matter. These factors were the principal considerations that led us to determine that Deferred Drilling Obligation and Gain on
Turnkey Drilling is a critical audit matter.

We obtained an understanding of the design and implementation of management’s controls related to the estimations in determining the expected
cost to drill a well, develop the well site, and when obligations under the Private Placement Memorandums have been fulfilled. Other audit
procedures involved selecting a sample of wells to test management’s estimates as follows:

         ●    Obtained the master spreadsheet for each selected well, recalculated the worksheet for clerical accuracy, and sampled the direct
              working interest (DWI) investors;
         ●    Obtained the signed field subscription agreement for each selected investor in each well, verified the investment ownership amount
              per the signed field subscription agreement agreed to the amount invested and the number of units within the master spreadsheet,
              vouched the cash received from the DWI investors, and agreed the significant terms to the related Private Placement Memorandum;
         ●    Obtained a schedule of costs incurred to drill the selected well, recalculated the schedule for clerical accuracy, and obtained support
              from management to substantiate the costs incurred; and
         ●    Obtained evidence substantiating the timing and amount of the turnkey gain recognized for a sample of wells drilled and assessed
              that the recognized turnkey gain was appropriate as defined under the terms of the Private Placement Memorandums.

and the Gain on Turnkey Drilling was approximately $1.7 million.

Company management applies significant estimation in determining the expected cost to drill a well and to develop the well site, and significant

related to the matter. These factors were the principal considerations that led us to determine that Deferred Drilling Obligation and Gain on
Turnkey Drilling is a critical audit matter.

The primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included:

  ● Selecting a sample of wells and:

         o    Obtaining the master spreadsheet for each selected well, recalculating the worksheet for clerical accuracy, and sampling the direct
              working interest (DWI) investors;

         o    Obtaining signed field subscription agreement for each selected investor in each well, verifying the investment ownership amount
              per the signed field subscription agreement agreed to the amount invested and the number of units within the master spreadsheet,
              vouching the cash received from the DWI investors, and agreeing the significant terms to the related Private Placement
              Memorandum;

         o    Obtaining a schedule of costs incurred to drill the selected well, recalculating the schedule for clerical accuracy, and obtaining
              support from management to substantiate the costs incurred; and

         o    Obtaining evidence substantiating the timing and amount of the recognition of turnkey gain pertaining to a sample of wells drilled
              and assessing that the recognition of the turnkey gain was appropriate as defined under the terms of the Private Placement
              Memorandums.

                                        NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

This summary of significant accounting policies of Royale Energy, Inc. (in these notes sometimes called “Royale Energy,” “Royale,” or the
“Company”) is presented to assist in understanding Royale Energy’s financial statements.

These consolidated financial statements include the accounts of our controlled subsidiaries. Investments in unincorporated joint ventures and
undivided interests in certain operating assets are consolidated on a pro rata basis. The financial statements and notes are representations of
Royale Energy’s management, which is responsible for their integrity and objectivity. These accounting policies conform to accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America and have been consistently applied in the preparation of the financial statements.

Description of Business

Royale Energy is an independent oil and gas producer which also has operations in the area of turnkey drilling. Royale Energy owns wells and
leases in major geological basins located primarily in California, Texas, Oklahoma, Colorado, and Utah. Royale Energy offers fractional working
interests and seeks to minimize the risks of oil and gas drilling by selling multiple well drilling projects which do not include the use of debt
financing.

Use of Estimates

The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America and requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Estimated quantities of crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas reserves is a significant estimate that requires judgment. All of the reserve
data included in this Form 10-K are estimates. Reservoir engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of crude oil
and condensate, NGLs and natural gas. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved crude oil and condensate,
NGLs and natural gas reserves. The accuracy of any reserves estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and
geological interpretation and judgment. As a result, reserve estimates may be different from the quantities of crude oil and condensate, NGLs and
natural gas that are ultimately recovered. See Note 19 – Supplemental Information About Oil and Gas Producing Activities (Unaudited) to our
Financial Statements for further detail.

Other items subject to estimates and assumptions include the carrying amounts of accounts receivable, property, plant and equipment, equity
method investments, asset retirement obligations, and valuation allowances for deferred tax assets, among others. Although we believe these
estimates, actual results could differ from these estimates.

Liquidity and Going Concern

The primary sources of liquidity have historically been issuances of common stock, oil and gas sales through ongoing operations and the sale of
oil and gas properties. There are factors that give rise to substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to meet liquidity demands, and we
anticipate that our primary sources of liquidity will be from the issuance of debt and/or equity, the sale of oil and natural gas property
participation interests through our normal course of business and the sale of non-strategic assets.

The Company’s 2021 consolidated financial statements reflect a working capital deficiency of $6,797,815 and a net loss from operations of
$3,598,418. These factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying consolidated financial
statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.

Management’s plans to alleviate the going concern by cost control measures that include the reduction of overhead costs and the sale of non-
strategic assets. There is no assurance that additional financing will be available when needed or that management will be able to obtain financing
on terms acceptable to the Company and whether the Company will become profitable and generate positive operating cash flow. If the Company
is unable to raise sufficient additional funds, it will have to develop and implement a plan to further extend payables, attempt to extend note
repayments, and reduce overhead until sufficient additional capital is raised to support further operations. There can be no assurance that such a
plan will be successful.

                                                                       F-13

Restricted Cash

Royale sponsors turnkey drilling arrangements in proved and unproved properties. The contracts require that participants pay Royale the full
contract price upon execution of the drilling agreement. Each participant earns an undivided interest in the well bore at the completion of the well.
A portion of the funds received in advance of the drilling of a well from a working interest participant are held for the expressed purpose of
drilling a well. If something changes, the Company may designate these funds for a substitute well. Under certain conditions, a portion of these
funds may be required to be returned to a participant. Once the well is drilled, the funds are used to satisfy the drilling cost. Royale classifies these
funds prior to commencement of drilling as restricted cash based on guidance codified as under the Financial Accounting Standards Board
(“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 230-10-50-8. In the event that progress payments are made from these funds; they are
recorded as Prepaid Expenses and Other Current Assets.

The following table provides a reconciliation of cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash reported within the statement of financial position that
sum to the total of the same amounts shown in the statement of cash flows.

Other Receivables

Our other receivables consist of receivables from direct working interest investors and industry partners. We provide for uncollectible accounts
receivable using the allowance method of accounting for bad debts. Under this method of accounting, a provision for uncollectible accounts is
charged directly to bad debt expense when it becomes probable the receivable will not be collected. The allowance account is increased or
decreased based on past collection history and management’s evaluation of accounts receivable. All amounts considered uncollectible are charged
against the allowance account and recoveries of previously charged off accounts are added to the allowance. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the
Company established an allowance for uncollectable accounts of $2,761,398 and $2,582,093, respectively, for receivables from direct working
interest investors whose expenses on non-producing wells were unlikely to be collected from revenue.

Revenue Receivables

Our revenue receivables consist of receivables related to the sale of our natural gas and oil. Once a production month is completed, we receive
payment approximately 15 to 30 days later. Historically, Royale has not had issues related to the collection of revenue receivables, and as such
has determined that an allowance for revenue receivables is not currently necessary.

Equity Method Investments

Investments in entities over which we have significant influence, but not control, are accounted for using the equity method of accounting.
Income from equity method investments represents our proportionate share of net income generated by the equity method investees and is
reflected in revenue and other income in our consolidated statements of income. Equity method investments are included as noncurrent assets on
the consolidated balance sheet.

Equity method investments are assessed for impairment whenever changes in the facts and circumstances indicate a loss in value may have
occurred as called for under ASC 323, Investments—Equity Method and Joint Ventures. When a loss is deemed to have occurred and is other than
temporary, the carrying value of the equity method investment is written down to fair value, and the amount of the write-down is included in
income.

The earnings from RMX reflected in these financial statements as Investment in JV, reflect our share of net earnings or losses directly attributable
to this equity method investment. At December 31, 2020, we evaluated our investment in RMX and determined that our investment was impaired
as further described in Note 2 – RMX Joint Venture.

                                                                          F-14

Revenue Recognition

A significant portion of our revenues are derived from the sale of crude oil, condensate, natural gas liquids (“NGLs”) and natural gas under spot
and term agreements with our customers.

               NGL Sales                                                                                 3,330               536
                                                                                           $         1,686,424 $       1,542,803

The pricing in our hydrocarbon sales agreements are variable, determined using various published benchmarks which are adjusted for negotiated
quality and location differentials. As a result, revenue collected under our agreements with customers is highly dependent on the market
conditions and may fluctuate considerably as the hydrocarbon market prices rise or fall. Typically, our customers pay us monthly, within a short
period of time after we deliver the hydrocarbon products. As such, we do not have any financing element associated with our contracts. We do not
have any issues related to returns or refunds, as product specifications are standardized for the industry and are typically measured when
transferred to a common carrier or midstream entity, and other contractual mechanisms (e.g., price adjustments) are used when products do not
meet those specifications.

In limited cases, we may also collect advance payments from customers as stipulated in our agreements; payments in excess of recognized
revenue are recorded as contract liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet.

Under our hydrocarbon sales agreements, the entire consideration amount is variable either due to pricing and/or volumes. We recognize revenue
in the amount of variable consideration allocated to distinct units of hydrocarbons transferred to a customer. Such allocation reflects the amount
of total consideration we expect to collect for completed deliveries of hydrocarbons and the terms of variable payment relate specifically to our
efforts to satisfy the performance obligations under these contracts. Our performance obligations under our hydrocarbon sales agreements are to
deliver either the entire production from the dedicated wells or specified contractual volumes of hydrocarbons.

We often serve as the operator for jointly owned oil and gas properties. As part of this role, we perform activities to explore, develop and produce
oil and gas properties in accordance with the joint operating arrangement and collective decisions of the joint parties. Other working interest
owners reimburse us for costs incurred based on our agreements. We determined that these activities are not performed as part of customer
relationships, and such reimbursements are recorded as cost reimbursements.

We commonly market the share of production belonging to other working interest owners as the operator of jointly owned oil and gas properties.
Those marketing activities are carried out as part of the collaborative arrangement, and we do not purchase or otherwise obtain control of other
working interest owners’ share of production. Therefore, we act as a principal only in regard to the sale of our share of production and recognize
revenue for the volumes associated with our net production.

The Company frequently sells a portion of the working interest in each well it drills or participates in to third-party investors and retains a portion
of the prospect for its own account. The Company typically guarantees a cost to drill to the third-party drilling participants and records a loss or
gain on the difference between the guaranteed price and the actual cost to drill the well. When monies are received from third parties for future
drilling obligations, the Company records the liability as Turnkey Drilling Obligations. Once the contracted depth for the drilling of the well is
reached and a determination as to the commercial viability of the well (typically call “Casing Point Election” or “Logging Point”), the difference
in the actual cost to drill and the guaranteed cost is recorded as income or expense depending on whether there was a gain or loss.

Crude oil and condensate

For the crude sales agreements, we satisfy our performance obligations and recognize revenue once customers take control of the crude at the
designated delivery points, which include pipelines, trucks or vessels.

                                                                         F-15

Natural Gas and NGLs

When selling natural gas and NGLs, we engage midstream entities to process our production stream by separating natural gas from the NGLs.
Frequently, these midstream entities also purchase our natural gas and NGLs under the same agreements. In these situations, we determined the
performance obligation is complete and satisfied at the tailgate of the processing plant when the natural gas and NGLs become identifiable and
measurable products. We determined the plant tailgate is the point in time where control, as defined in the new revenue standard, is transferred to
midstream entities and they are entitled to significant risks and rewards of ownership of the natural gas and NGLs.

The amounts due to midstream entities for gathering and processing services are recognized as shipping and handling cost and included as lease
operating expense in our consolidated statement of operations, since we make those payments in exchange for distinct services with the exception
of natural gas sold to PG&E where transportation is netted directly against revenue. Under some of our natural gas processing agreements, we
have an option to take the processed natural gas and NGLs in-kind and sell to customers other than the processing company. In those
circumstances, our performance obligations are complete after delivering the processed hydrocarbons to the customer at the designated delivery
points, which may be the tailgate of the processing plant or an alternative delivery point requested by the customer.

Turnkey Drilling Obligations

These Turnkey Agreements are managed by the Company for the participants of the well. The collections of pre-drilling AFE amounts are
segregated by the Company and the gains and losses on the Turnkey Agreements are recorded in income or expense at the time of the casing point
election in accordance with ASC 932-323-25 and 932-360. The Company manages the performance obligation for the well participants and only
records revenue or expense at the time the performance obligation of the Turnkey Agreement has been satisfied.

Supervisory Fees and Other

For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company recognized $32,240 and $45,052, respectively in supervisory fees in Pipeline and
Compressor fees which are received and allocated based on production volumes.

Oil and Gas Property and Equipment

Successful Efforts

Royale Energy uses the “successful efforts” method to account for its exploration and production activities. Under this method, Royale Energy
accumulates its proportionate share of costs on a well-by-well basis with certain exploratory expenditures and exploratory dry holes being
expensed as incurred, and capitalizes expenditures for productive wells. Royale Energy amortizes the costs of productive wells under the unit-of-
production method.

Royale Energy carries, as an asset, exploratory well costs when the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify its completion as a
producing well and where Royale Energy is making sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the
project. Exploratory well costs not meeting these criteria are charged to expense. Other exploratory expenditures, including geophysical costs and
annual lease rentals, are expensed as incurred. Acquisition costs of proved properties are amortized using a unit-of-production method, computed
on the basis of total proved oil and gas reserves.

Capitalized exploratory drilling and development costs associated with productive depletable extractive properties are amortized using unit-of-
production rates based on the amount of proved developed reserves of oil and gas that are estimated to be recoverable from existing facilities
using current operating methods. Under the unit-of-production method, oil and gas volumes are considered produced once they have been
measured through meters at custody transfer or sales transaction points at the outlet valve on the lease or field storage tank.

Production Cost

Production costs are expensed as incurred. Production involves lifting the oil and gas to the surface and gathering, treating, field processing and
field storage of the oil and gas. The production function normally terminates at the outlet valve on the lease or field production storage tank.
Production costs are those incurred to operate and maintain Royale Energy’s wells and related equipment and facilities. They become part of the
cost of oil and gas produced. These costs, sometimes referred to as lifting costs, include such items as labor costs to operate the wells and related
equipment; repair and maintenance costs on the wells and equipment; materials, supplies and energy costs required to operate the wells and
related equipment; and administrative expenses related to the production activity.

                                                                        F-16
Table of Contents

Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization

Depreciation, depletion and amortization, based on cost less estimated salvage value of the asset, are primarily determined under either the unit-
of-production method or the straight-line method, which is based on estimated asset service life taking obsolescence into consideration.
Maintenance and repairs, including planned major maintenance, are expensed as incurred. Major renewals and improvements are capitalized, and
the assets replaced are retired.

The project drilling phase commences with the development of the detailed engineering design and ends when the assets are ready for their
intended use. Interest costs, to the extent they are incurred to finance expenditures during the construction phase, are included in property, plant
and equipment and are depreciated over the service life of the related assets.

Impairment

We evaluate our oil and gas producing properties, including capitalized costs of exploratory wells and development costs, for impairment of value
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If the sum of the expected
undiscounted future cash flows from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition is less than the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment
loss is recognized based on the fair value of the asset. Oil and gas producing properties are reviewed for impairment on a field-by-field basis or, in
certain instances, by logical grouping of assets if there is significant shared infrastructure or contractual terms that cause economic
interdependency amongst separate, discrete fields. Oil and gas producing properties deemed to be impaired are written down to their fair value, as
determined by discounted future net cash flows or, if available, comparable market value. We evaluate our unproved property investment and
record impairment based on time or geologic factors. Information such as drilling results, reservoir performance, seismic interpretation or future
plans to develop acreage is also considered. When unproved property investments are deemed to be impaired, this amount is reported in
exploration expenses in our consolidated statements of income. During 2021 the Company recorded impairment losses of $177,011, on various
capitalized lease and land costs where the carrying value exceeded the fair value. In 2020 there were no impairment losses.

Upon the sale or retirement of a complete field of a proved property, Royale Energy eliminates the cost from its books, and the resultant gain or
loss is recorded to Royale Energy’s Statement of Operations. Upon the sale of an entire interest in an unproved property where the property has
been assessed for impairment individually, a gain or loss is recognized in Royale Energy’s Statement of Operations. If a partial interest in an
unproved property is sold, any funds received are accounted for as a recovery of the cost in the interest retained with any excess funds recognized
as a gain. Should Royale Energy’s turnkey drilling agreements include unproved property, total drilling costs incurred to satisfy its obligations are
recovered by the total funds received under the agreements. Any excess funds are recorded as a Gain on Turnkey Drilling Programs, and any
costs not recovered are capitalized and accounted for under the “successful efforts” method.

Long-Lived Assets Classified as Held for Sale

Royale classifies long-lived assets as Held-for-Sale when the criteria of ASC 360-10-45-9 through 45-11, Impairment and Disposal of Long-
Lived Assets, have been met. This criterion is listed below:

          ●         Management has committed to a plan to sell the asset;
          ●         The asset group is available for immediate sale in its present condition;
          ●         An active program is underway to locate potential buyers;
          ●         The sale is probable within one year;
          ●         The asset group is being marketed at a price that is reasonable relative to its current fair value; and
          ●         Actions required to complete the plan indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made or the plan
                    will be withdrawn.

Assets held for sale are carried at the lower of cost or fair market value less cost of disposal in current assets. If the Company retains the
responsibility for the P&A, equipment removal or site restoration, the associated anticipated expense is carried as current ARO. The Company has
two property groups that are being Held for Sale as further described in Note 17 – Long-Lived Assets Held for Sale.

                                                                         F-17

Turnkey Drilling

Royale Energy sponsors turnkey drilling agreement arrangements in proved and unproved properties as a pooling of assets in a joint undertaking,
whereby proceeds from participants are reported as Deferred Drilling Obligations, and then reduced as costs to complete its obligations are
incurred with any excess booked against its property account to reduce any basis in its own interest. Gains on Turnkey Drilling Programs
represent funds received from turnkey drilling participants in excess of all costs Royale incurs during the drilling programs (e.g., lease
acquisition, exploration and development costs), including costs incurred on behalf of participants and costs incurred for its own account; and are
recognized only upon making this determination after Royale’s obligations have been fulfilled.

The contracts require the participants pay Royale Energy the full contract price upon execution of the agreement. Royale Energy completes the
drilling activities typically between 10 and 30 days after drilling begins. The participant retains an undivided or proportional beneficial interest in
the property, and is also responsible for its proportionate share of operating costs. Royale Energy retains legal title to the lease. The participants
purchase a working interest directly in the well bore.

In these working interest arrangements, the participants are responsible for sharing in the risk of development, but also sharing in a proportional
interest in rights to revenues and proportional liability for the cost of operations after drilling is completed and the interest is conveyed to the
participant.

A certain portion of the turnkey drilling participant’s funds received are non-refundable. The Company holds all funds invested as Deferred
Drilling Obligations until drilling is complete. Occasionally, drilling is delayed for various reasons such as weather, permitting, drilling rig
availability and/or contractual obligations. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, Royale Energy had Deferred Drilling Obligations of $7,824,939 and
$3,127,500, respectively. During 2021, we disposed of $1,841,061 of drilling obligations upon completing the drilling of two oil wells in Texas,
while incurring expenses of $1,905,529, resulting in a loss of $64,468. During 2020, we disposed of $6,432,675 of drilling obligations upon
completing the drilling of five oil wells, three in California and two in Texas, while incurring expenses of $4,732,213, resulting in a gain of
$1,700,462.

If Royale Energy is unable to drill the wells, and a suitable replacement well is not found, Royale would retain the non-refundable portion of the
contact and return the remaining funds to the participant. Included in cash and cash equivalents are amounts for use in completion of turnkey
drilling programs in progress.

Equipment and Fixtures

Equipment and fixtures are stated at cost and depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from three to seven years,
using the straight-line method. Repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred. When assets are sold or retired, the cost and related
accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is included in income. Maintenance and repairs, which
neither materially add to the value of the property nor appreciably prolong its life, are charged to expense as incurred. Gains or losses on
dispositions of property and equipment, other than oil and gas, are reflected in operations.

Income (Loss) Per Share

Basic and diluted losses per share are calculated as follows:

                                                                                                     Year Ended December 31,

securities were not included in the dilutive loss per share due to their antidilutive nature.

Stock Based Compensation

Royale has a stock-based employee compensation plan, which is more fully described in Note 11 – Stock Compensation Plan. The Company has
adopted ASC 718, Compensation – Stock Compensation, for share-based payments. This topic requires that the cost resulting from all share-
based payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements. It further establishes fair value as the measurement objective in accounting
for share-based payment arrangements and requires all entities to apply a fair-value based measurement method in accounting for share-based
payment transactions with employees except for equity instruments held by employee stock ownership plans.

Income Taxes

Royale utilizes the asset and liability approach to measure deferred tax assets and liabilities based on temporary differences existing at each
balance sheet date using currently enacted tax rates in accordance with the Income Taxes Topic of the ASC 740. Deferred tax assets and liabilities
are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment. Under the Topic, deferred tax assets are reduced by a
valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more-likely-than-not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be
realized.

The provision for income taxes is based on pretax financial accounting income. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected
tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported net amounts.

Fair Value Measurements

According to Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures guidance as provided by ASC 820 and 825, assets and liabilities that are measured at fair
value on a recurring and nonrecurring basis in period subsequent to initial recognition, the reporting entity shall disclose information that enable
users of its financial statements to assess the inputs used to develop those measurements and for recurring fair value measurements using
significant unobservable inputs, the effect of the measurements on earnings for the period.

Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market
participants at the measurement date. In determining fair value, the Company utilizes valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable
inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs to the extent possible as well as considers counterparty credit risk in its assessment of fair
value. Carrying amounts of the Company’s financial instruments, including cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued
liabilities, approximate their fair values as of the balance sheet dates because of their generally short maturities.

The fair value hierarchy distinguishes between (1) market participant assumptions developed based on market data obtained from independent
sources (observable inputs) and (2) an entity’s own assumptions about market participant assumptions developed based on the best information
available in the circumstances (unobservable inputs). The fair value hierarchy consists of three broad levels, which gives the highest priority to
unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). The
three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below:

Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for assets or liabilities.

Level 2: Directly or indirectly observable inputs as of the reporting date through correlation with market data, including quoted prices for similar
assets and liabilities in active markets and quoted prices in markets that are not active. Level 2 also includes assets and liabilities that are valued
using models or other pricing methodologies that do not require significant judgment since the input assumptions used in the models, such as
interest rates and volatility factors, are corroborated by readily observable data from actively quoted markets for substantially the full term of the
financial instrument.

Level 3: Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and reflect the use of significant management judgment. These
values are generally determined using pricing models for which the assumptions utilize management’s estimates of market participant
assumptions

At December 31, 2021 and 2020, Royale Energy does not have any financial assets measured and recognized at fair value on a recurring basis.
The Company estimates asset retirement obligations pursuant to the provisions of ASC 410, Asset Retirement and Environmental Obligations.
The initial measurement of asset retirement obligations at fair value is calculated using discounted cash flow techniques and based on internal
estimates of future retirement costs associated with oil and gas properties. Given the unobservable nature of the inputs, including plugging costs
and reserve lives, the initial measurement of the asset retirement obligation liability is deemed to use Level 3 inputs. See Note 3 – Oil and Gas
Properties, Equipment and Fixtures for further discussion of the Company’s asset retirement obligations.

Accrued – Non-current

At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company had non-current accrued liabilities of $1,306,605 and accrued unpaid guaranteed payment of
$1,616,205, due to certain Matrix principals, from periods prior to the merger with the Matrix entities during March of 2018.

Business Combinations

From time-to-time, the Company acquires businesses in the oil and gas industry. Royale primarily targets businesses in geological basins that the
Company considers to be in a focus area. Businesses are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition.

We recognize, separately from goodwill, the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their estimated acquisition-date fair values. We
measure and recognize goodwill as of the acquisition date as the excess of: (1) the aggregate of the fair value of consideration transferred, the fair
value of any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree (if any) and the acquisition date fair value of our previously held equity interest in the
acquiree (if any), over (2) the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. If information about facts and circumstances existing as of the
acquisition date is incomplete by the end of the reporting period in which a business combination occurs, we report provisional amounts for the
items for which the accounting is incomplete. The measurement or allocation period ends once we receive the information we are seeking;
however, this period will generally not exceed one year from the acquisition date. Any material adjustments recognized during the measurement
period will be reflected retrospectively in the consolidated financial statements of the subsequent period. We recognize third-party transaction-
related costs as expense currently in the period in which they are incurred.

Changes in Accounting Standards

Recently Adopted

ASU 2020-04, Changes to the fair value disclosure requirements

In March 2020, FASB issued ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848), Facilitation of the effects of Reference Rate Reform on
Financial Reporting. This pronouncement provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying GAAP to contract modifications, hedging
relationships, and other transactions affected by the anticipated transition away from LIBOR. This new ASU is eligible to be applied upon release
and has various transition requirements. The Company acquired certain hedge contracts with the merger with the Matrix Companies in 2018.
Those hedge contracts were transferred to RMX with the formation of the RMX Joint Venture as more fully described in Note 2 – RMX Joint
Venture. The transition from LIBOR currently taking place in the financial markets will not have any impact on the Company or its existing
financial instruments or agreements.

                                                                         F-20
Table of Contents

Not Adopted

ASU 2016-13, Credit Impairment

In June of 2016, the FASB issued ASC Topic 326, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses. This new guidance replaces the current incurred loss
impairment model with a requirement to recognize lifetime expected credit losses immediately when a financial asset is originated or purchased.
This new Current Expected Credit Losses (“CECL”) model applies to (1) loans, accounts receivable, trade receivables, and other financial assets
measured at amortized cost, (2) loan commitments and certain other off-balance sheet credit exposures, (3) debt securities and financial assets
measured at fair value, and (4) beneficial interests in securitized financial assets. This ASU was effective for SEC filers beginning after December
15, 2019; however, on November 15, 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-10, which delayed the effective date for “smaller reporting companies.”
Therefore, ASU 2016-13 is effective for "smaller reporting companies" (as defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission) such as Royale,
for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those years, and must be adopted under the modified

NOTE 2 – RMX JOINT VENTURE

RMX Joint Venture

On April 13, 2018, Royale Energy, Inc., and two of Royale’s subsidiaries, Royale Energy Funds, Inc. and Matrix Oil Management Corporation
(the “Royale Entities”) completed the Subscription and Contribution Agreement (“Contribution Agreement”), in which the Royale Entities and
CIC RMX LP (“CIC”) entered into the Contribution Agreement and certain other agreements providing that the Royale Entities would contribute
certain assets to RMX Resources, LLC (“RMX”), a newly formed Texas limited liability company formed to facilitate the investment from CIC.
In exchange for its contributed assets, Royale received a 20% equity interest in RMX, an equity performance incentive interest and up to $20.0
million to pay off Royale Entities senior lender, Arena Limited SPV, LLC., in full, and to pay Royale Entities trade payables and other
outstanding obligations. CIC contributed an aggregate of $25.0 million in cash to RMX in exchange for (i) an 80% equity interest in RMX with
preferred distributions until certain thresholds are met, (ii) a warrant (“Warrant”) to acquire up to 4,000,000 shares of Royale’s common stock at
an exercise price of $.01 per share and registration rights pursuant to a Registration Rights Agreement.

RMX has a six-member board of managers. Royale has two seats on the board giving it a third of the Board. Royale has designated Michael
McCaskey and Johnny Jordan as its members of the RMX board. The return targets for CIC through its funding of RMX provide for a “waterfall”
style return profile with the first distributions going to CIC until it has received all Unpaid Preferred Return and Unpaid Preferred Enhanced
Return, as defined by the Company’s Agreement.

Royale accounts for its ownership interest in RMX following the equity method of accounting, in accordance with ASC 323, Investments
—Equity Method and Joint Ventures.

Under the provisions of the Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement of RMX Resources, LLC (“RMX Agreement”) dated
March 27, 2018, the gains and losses of the partnership are distributed as if all of RMX’s assets were sold for cash at a price equal to their book
basis and all RMX liabilities were satisfied at their book basis and all of the remaining assets of RMX were distributed in accordance with Section
5.4 of the RMX Agreement. Notwithstanding the above, for each fiscal year or other relevant period, deductions attributable to exploration costs,
IDCs, and operating and maintenance costs shall be allocated 100% to the CIC members pro rata in accordance with their Class B percentage
interests for each fiscal year.

                                                                       F-21

RMX Joint Venture Post-Closing

On March 11, 2019, Royale entered into a Settlement Agreement with RMX Resources to resolve differences resulting from the calculation of
certain post-closing amounts as called for under Section 7.3 of the Subscription and Contribution Agreement.
Pursuant to this settlement, Royale continues to be liable for the payment of all royalties and suspended funds incurred prior to March 1, 2018.
Also, as part of this Settlement Agreement, RMX will offer Royale the right, but not the obligation to participate in a portion of the working
interest, in a number of wells to be drilled in the Sansinena, Sempra, Whittier and/or East LA properties in Los Angeles County, California. The
minimum number of wells to be offered to Royale in each year is 2 net wells as determined by an agreed upon methodology. The Agreement also
calls for certain credits toward future drilling costs of the offered wells.

The RMX Joint Venture, like any Joint Venture investment following the equity method, is subject to ASC 323-10-35-31 and 32, impairment
testing. During the 4th quarter of 2020, Royale received the RMX engineering reserve report prepared by an independent outside engineering
firm. The report reflected reserve values for RMX that were below the Company’s expectations. As a result, of this and on-going market
conditions along with the contractual terms of Royale’s investment in RMX, management performed an impairment test. Royale considered the
waterfall formula as called for under its agreements with RMX as well as the preferred return owed to other partners. As part of this computation,
Royale applied a discounted cash flow test as called for under ASC 820-10-55-5(c) and 5(d) incorporating the time value of money and risk
premium. In our test, we considered factors including, most significantly, the estimated market value of the reserves of RMX and the amount of
preferred return owed to other partners. As a result of this analysis and the fact that Management does not believe the values reflected in this most
recent reserve report are temporary, Royale does not expect to realize the entire carrying amount of the RMX investment. Therefore, the entire
investment of $6,185,995 was impaired and was taken to the Statement of Operations in the year ended December 31, 2020.

Additional reasons that Royale considers this impairment to be permanent is that these assets are located in California close to urban dwellings
and subject to increasing regulatory scrutiny. Further, the current state administration has indicated a strong desire to impose increasing
regulations on oil and gas producing properties thereby reducing their economic value.

Because the Company does not expect the value of the RMX Joint Venture to improve to a level where the water-fall profit sharing formula will
provide value to Royale, the Company is no longer providing summarized financial information on the RMX investment in its financial
statements or its reserve disclosures. Further the investment in RMX Joint Venture was $0 as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, due to the full
impairment in 2020.

NOTE 4 – ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATION

The Asset Retirement and Environmental Obligations Topic of the ASC 410-20 requires that an asset retirement obligation (“ARO”) associated
with the retirement of a tangible long-lived asset be recognized as a liability in the period in which it is incurred or becomes determinable (as
defined by the standard), with an associated increase in the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset. The cost of the tangible asset,
including the initially recognized asset retirement cost, is depreciated over the useful life of the asset. The ARO is recorded at the estimated fair
value, and accretion expense will be recognized over time as the discounted liability is accreted to its expected settlement value. Accretion
expense is included as part of Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. The fair value (as provided
in ASC 820 guidance) of the ARO is measured using expected future cash outflows discounted at the Company’s credit-adjusted risk-free interest
rate. The provisions of this Topic apply to legal obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets that result from the acquisition,
development, and operation of a long-lived asset. There were no changes in estimates for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.

NOTE 6 – INCOME TAXES

Deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for
financial reporting purposes and amounts used for income tax purposes. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the
opinion of management, it is more-likely-than-not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and
liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment. In 2016, the Company adopted Accounting
Standards Update (ASU) 2015-17 and has classified all of its deferred tax assets and liabilities as noncurrent on its balance sheet.

Significant components of the Company’s deferred assets and liabilities at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, are as follows:

                                                                                                 2021                   2020

The Company recorded a full valuation allowance against the net deferred tax assets in 2016. At the end of 2017, management reviewed the
reliability of the Company’s net deferred tax assets, and due to the Company’s continued cumulative losses in recent years, Royale and its
management concluded it is not “more-likely-than-not” its deferred tax assets will be realized. As a result, the Company will continue to record a
full valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets. The Company will assess the realizability of the deferred tax assets at least yearly and
make appropriate updates as needed. Royale Energy, Inc. and its subsidiaries have available net operating loss carryforwards of $20.5 million
generated in tax years ended before January 1, 2018, which if not utilized, begin to expire in the year 2026. Royale Energy, Inc. has $6.9 million
net operating loss carryforwards generated after December 31, 2017, which can be carried forward indefinitely.

A reconciliation of Royale Energy’s provision for income taxes and the amount computed by applying the statutory income tax rates at December
31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, to pretax income is as follows:

                                                                                                 2021                   2020

In January 2007, Royale adopted additional provisions from the Income Taxes Topic of the ASC, which clarified the accounting for uncertainty in
income taxes recognized in an entity’s financial statements and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for financial
statement disclosure of tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return. As a result of our implementation of the Topic at the time of
adoption and at December 31, 2018, the Company did not recognize a liability for uncertain tax positions. Currently, the only differences between
our financial statements and our income tax returns relate to normal timing differences such as depreciation, depletion and amortization, which
are recorded as deferred taxes on our balance sheets. We do not expect our unrecognized tax benefits to change significantly over the next 12
months. The tax years 2018 through 2020 remain open to examination by the taxing jurisdictions in which we file income tax returns.

NOTE 7 – SERIES B PREFERRED STOCK

Pursuant to the terms of the Merger all Class A limited partnership interests of Matrix Investments, LP (“Matrix Investments”) were exchanged
for Royale Common stock using conversion ratios according to the relative value of the Class A limited partnership interests, and $20,124,000 of
Matrix Investments preferred limited partnership interests were converted into 2,012,400 shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock of
Royale. The Board of Directors of Royale Energy, prior to the merger, authorized 3,000,000 shares of Series B Convertible Preferred, which
carries a liquidation preference and a 3.5% annual dividend, payable quarterly in cash or Paid-In-Kind (“PIK”) shares. The Series B Convertible
Preferred Stock is convertible at the option of the security holder at the rate of ten shares of common stock for one share of Series B Convertible
Preferred Stock. The Series B Preferred Stock has never been registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and no market exists for the
shares. Additionally, the Series B Convertible Preferred shares will automatically convert to common at any time in which the Volume Weighted
Average Price (“VWAP”) of the common stock exceeds $3.50 per share for 20 consecutive trading days, the shares are registered with the SEC
and the volume of common shares trades exceeds 200,000 shares per day. The shareholders of the Series B Convertible Preferred may vote the
number of shares into which they would be entitled to convert, beginning in 2020.

In accordance with ASC 480-10-S99-1.02, the Company has determined that the conversion or redemption of these shares are outside the sole
control of the Company and that they should be classified in mezzanine or temporary equity as redeemable noncontrolling interest beginning at
the reporting period, ended March 31, 2020.

For 2021 and 2020, the board authorized the payment of each quarterly dividend of Series B Convertible Preferred shares, as Paid-In-Kind shares
(“PIK”) to be paid immediately following the end of the quarter. For the 12 months ending December 31, 2021, the Company issued 58,667
shares with a value of $586,661, with 20,117 shares with a value of $201,172 accrued for but not yet issued at 12/31/21. For the 12 months ending
December 31, 2020, the Company issued 76,290 shares with a value of $762,900. During 2021 and 2020, no cash was used to pay dividends on
Series B preferred shares.

NOTE 8 – COMMON STOCK

During the year 2021 and 2020, the Company issued shares of its Common Stock in lieu of cash payments for salaries, fees or incentives to
various officers and board members, including our CEO, as noted in the statement of Stockholders’ Equity (Deficit).

NOTE 9 – OPERATING LEASES

The Company has two office leases. One at 1530 Hilton Head Road, El Cajon, California the location of its corporate offices and one at 104 W.
Anapamu, Santa Barbara, California, the location of the Company’s CEO and engineering team. The corporate office lease was entered into on
August 12, 2021, begins on January 1, 2022 and expires on December 31, 2026, with initial monthly payments of $6,922 with escalations. The
previous corporate office lease was entered into on August 31, 2016 and expired on October 31, 2021 The lease in Santa Barbara was initiated in
December of 2006 and, through several extensions and renewals, will expire in March of 2022.

                                                                       F-26

The Company has elected the short-term lease recognition exemption for all leases that qualify. This means, for those leases that qualify, we will
not recognize ROU assets or lease liabilities, and this includes not recognizing ROU assets or lease liabilities for existing short-term leases of
those assets in transition. We also currently expect to elect the practical expedient to not separate lease and non-lease components for all of our
finance leases. For our real estate operating leases, we have only considered the fixed portion of our lease payment commitment and have
excluded the variable components from the capitalized ROU and lease liability.

Lease expense for operating as well as finance leases are included in General and Administrative expense and interest expense on the
Consolidated Statement of Operations, while the lease expense for those leases that are short-term are included in Oil and Gas Lease Operating
Expenses. The amounts are as follows:

NOTE 11 – STOCK COMPENSATION PLAN

There were no stock options issued during 2021 and 2020.

NOTE 12 – SIMPLE IRA PLAN

In April 1998, the Company established a Simple IRA pension plan covering all employees. The Company will contribute a matching
contribution to each eligible employee’s Simple IRA equal to the employee’s salary reduction contributions up to a limit of 3% of the employee’s
compensation for the year. The employer contribution for the years ending December 31, 2021 and 2020, were $31,509 and $41,921 respectively.

NOTE 13 – ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

Royale Energy has established procedures for the continuing evaluation of its operations to identify potential environmental exposures and ensure
compliance with regulatory policies and procedures. Management monitors these laws and regulations and periodically assesses the propriety of
its operational and accounting policies related to environmental issues. The nature of Royale Energy’s business requires routine day-to-day
compliance with environmental laws and regulations. Royale Energy incurred no material environmental investigation, compliance and
remediation costs in 2021 or 2020.

Royale Energy is unable to predict whether its future operations will be materially affected by these laws and regulations. It is believed that
legislation and regulations relating to environmental protection will not materially affect the results of operations of Royale Energy.

NOTE 14 – CONCENTRATIONS

The Company bids its gas sales on a month-to-month basis and generally sells to a single customer without commitment to future gas sales to any
particular customer. The Company normally sells approximately 41% of its yearly natural gas production to one customer on a month-to-month
basis. Since we are able to sell our natural gas to other readily available customers, the loss of any one customer would not have an adverse effect
on our overall sales operations.

The Company maintains cash in depository institutions that are guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) up to $250,000
per institution for our interest-bearing accounts in the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2021. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, cash in banks
exceeded the FDIC limits by approximately $3.9 million and $1.9 million, respectively. The Company has not experienced any losses on deposits.

NOTE 15 – COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

The Company may become involved from time to time in litigation on various matters, which are routine to the conduct of its business. The
Company believes that none of these actions, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on its financial position or
results of operations, though any adverse decision in these cases or the costs of defending or settling such claims could have a material effect on
its business.

The Company sponsors turnkey drilling agreement arrangements in proved and unproved properties as a pooling of assets in a joint undertaking,
whereby proceeds from participants are reported as Deferred Drilling Obligations. The contracts require the participants pay Royale the full
contract price upon execution of the agreement. Royale typically begins the drilling activities within 12 months of funding and reaches total depth
between 10 and 30 days after drilling begins.

                                                                        F-28

NOTE 16 – CORONAVIRUS AID, RELIEF, AND ECONOMIC SECURITY ACT (“CARES ACT”)

In December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus (which triggers a respiratory disease called COVID-19) was reported in Wuhan, China. The
World health Organization has declared the outbreak to constitute a “Public Health Emergency of International Concern.” The COVID-19
outbreak has caused a major reduction in the consumption of hydrocarbon-based transportation fuels as airlines have grounded flights worldwide
and countries around the world have asked residents to suspend automobile travel. In addition to a substantial loss of demand for crude oil, In
March, Saudi Arabia entered into a price war with Russia and added additional supplies of crude oil to an already over supplied market. The
result was a precipitous decline in the price of crude oil received by the Company. As a result, the Company experienced a reduction in its oil and
gas revenues and resulting cash flows for the year 2020.

The CARES Act provided tax benefits and potential loans/grants for businesses and non-profits. On April 13, 2020, the Company successfully
completed the process to obtain a $207,800 PPP Loan through the SBA with Bank of Southern California (“BSC”) under the CARES Act. The
interest rate was 1.00 percent per year fixed with a two-year term and all payments deferred for six months subject to loan forgiveness as provided
for under the CARES Act. On November 2, 2020, Royale’s loan with BSC was paid down by $198,846 ($197,800 in principal and $1,046 in
interest) as a result of completing the process of loan forgiveness under the terms of the CARES Act. The loan balance of $10,054 was forgiven
and paid by the SBA in February 2021.

On the Statement of Cash Flows, the Company has shown this PPP loan as a cash inflow from financing activities, principal repayments as cash
outflows from financing activities, and interest payments as outflows from operating activities. The amounts of principal and interest forgiven are
shown as reconciling items to net loss in determining net cash used in operating activities.

Under the updated regulations, the forgiveness of PPP Loan in not taxable income. Additionally, expenses submitted in support of the PPP Loan
forgiveness remain deductible for the purpose of tax reporting. Prior IRS positions in Notice 2020-32 and Rev Ruling 2020-27 no longer apply.

The company has also applied for approximately $150,000 in relief under the Employee Retention Credit program of the CARES act, for payroll
expenses incurred for 2020 and 2021. These funds have not been received by the Company.

NOTE 17 – LONG-LIVED ASSETS HELD FOR SALE

Assets held for sale are carried at lower of cost or fair value less cost to sell. Listed below are the two current groups of properties that the
Company has defined as long-lived assets held for sale in accordance with ASC 360-10-45.

East Los Angeles Sale

The Company and its joint venture partner, RMX, entered into a purchase and sales agreement as well as a second amendment to that certain
purchase and sales agreement which closed in September 2021. During 2021, the Company carried these assets on the books for $1.0 million
booked as Held for Sale with a current ARO amount of approximately $721,000 for the existing wells and facilities located on the properties. The
sale required RMX and the Company to plug and abandon the wells on the property and remove and restore the surface land. The sale price of
$1.0 million to the Company resulted in recording a loss on sale of these properties of approximately $254,000.

Non-operated West Texas Property Sale

During 2021, we recorded a gain of approximately $319,000 on the sale of asset on the sale of certain non-operated Texas properties. These non-
operated properties were originally acquired during the 2018 merger with Matrix Oil Management Corporation and booked as Held for Sale at
end 2020.

                                                                          F-29

NOTE 18 – SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

The Company has evaluated subsequent events through April 15, 2022, the date these financial statements were available to be issued. The
Company is not aware of any subsequent events which would require recognition or disclosure in the financial statements, except as noted here or
already recognized or disclosed. During the first quarter of 2022, we made a settlement payment of $75,000 to a vendor we owed approximately
$477,000 in accounts payable for legal fees at December 31, 2021. At January 1, 2022, the Company issued 20,117 shares of its Series B
Preferred stock with a value of $201,172 for its fourth quarter 2021 dividend that had been accrued for but not yet issued at December 31, 2021.

NOTE 19 – SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION ABOUT OIL AND GAS PRODUCING ACTIVITIES (UNAUDITED)

The following estimates of proved oil and gas reserves, both developed and undeveloped, represent interests owned by Royale Energy which are
located solely in the United States. Proved reserves represent estimated quantities of crude oil and natural gas which geological and engineering
data demonstrate to be reasonably certain to be recoverable in the future from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating
conditions. Proved developed oil and gas reserves are reserves that can be expected to be recovered through existing wells, with existing
equipment and operating methods. Proved undeveloped oil and gas reserves are reserves that are expected to be recovered from new wells on
undrilled acreage, or from existing wells for which relatively major expenditures are required for completion.

Disclosures of oil and gas reserves, which follow, are based on estimates prepared by independent petroleum engineering consultant Netherland,
Sewell & Associates, Inc., the net reserve value of its proved developed and undeveloped reserves was approximately $42.1 million at December
31, 2021, based on the average Henry Hub natural gas price spot price of $3.598 per MCF and for oil volumes, the average West Texas
Intermediate price of $66.55 per barrel as applied on a field-by-field basis. Netherland, Sewell & Associates, Inc. provided reserve value
information for the Company’s California, Texas, Oklahoma, Utah and Louisiana properties. Such estimates are subject to numerous uncertainties
inherent in the estimation of quantities of proved reserves and in the projection of future rates of production and the timing of development
expenditures. These estimates do not include probable or possible reserves.

The technical persons responsible for preparing the reserves estimates presented in the report of Netherland, Sewell & Associates, Inc., meet the
requirements regarding qualifications, independence, objectivity, and confidentiality set forth in the Standards Pertaining to the Estimating and
Auditing of Oil and Gas Reserves Information promulgated by the Society of Petroleum Engineers. Netherland, Sewell & Associates, Inc. is a
firm of independent petroleum engineers, geologists, geophysicists, and petrophysicists; and do not own an interest in our properties and are not
employed on a contingent basis. All activities and reports performed and completed by Netherland, Sewell & Associates, Inc. with regards to our
reserve valuation estimates are reviewed Royale’s management.

These estimates are furnished and calculated in accordance with requirements of the FASB and the SEC. Because of unpredictable variances in
expenses and capital forecasts, crude oil and natural gas price changes, largely influenced and controlled by U.S. and foreign government actions,
and the fact that the bases for such estimates vary significantly, management believes the usefulness of these projections is limited. Estimates of
future net cash flows presented do not represent Management’s assessment of future profitability or future cash flows to Royale Energy.
Management’s investment and operating decisions are based upon reserve estimates that include proved reserves prescribed by the SEC as well as
probable reserves, and upon different price and cost assumptions from those used here.

It should be recognized that applying current costs and prices and a 10 percent standard discount rate does not convey absolute value. The
discounted amounts arrived at are only one measure of the value of proved reserves.

                                                                       F-30

During 2021, our overall proved developed and undeveloped natural gas reserves decreased by 49.1% and our previously estimated proved
developed and undeveloped natural gas reserve quantities were revised downward by approximately 1.9 million cubic feet of natural gas. This
downward revision was mainly the result of a decrease in proved undeveloped natural gas reserves from drilling locations which the Company
had previously estimated.

Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows Relating to Proved Oil and Gas Reserves

The future net cash inflows are developed as follows:

•      Estimates are made of quantities of proved reserves and the future periods during which they are expected to be produced based on year-
       end economic conditions.

•      The estimated future production of proved reserves is priced on the basis of year-end prices.

•      The resulting future gross revenue streams are reduced by estimated future costs to develop and to produce proved reserves, based on
       year-end estimates. Estimated future development costs by year are as follows:

                                                                      F-31

Disclosure of principal components of the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows provides information concerning the factors
involved in making the calculation. In addition, the disclosure of both undiscounted and discounted net cash flows provides a measure of
comparing proved oil and gas reserves both with and without an estimate of production timing. The standardized measure of discounted future net
cash flow relating to proved reserves reflects estimated income taxes.

Changes in standardized measure of discounted future net cash flow from proved reserve quantities

The standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows is presented below for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.

This statement discloses the sources of changes in the standardized measure from year to year. The amount reported as “Net changes in prices and
production costs” represents the present value of changes in prices and production costs multiplied by estimates of proved reserves as of the
beginning of the year. The “accretion of discount” was computed by multiplying the 10 percent discount factor by the standardized measure on a
pretax basis as of the beginning of the year. The “Sales of oil and gas produced, net of production costs” are expressed in actual dollar amounts.
“Revisions of previous quantity estimates” is expressed at year-end prices. The “Net change in income taxes” is computed as the change in
present value of future income taxes.

Future Development Costs

In order to realize future revenues from our proved reserves estimated in our reserve report, it will be necessary to incur future costs to develop
and produce the proved reserves. The following table estimates the costs to develop and produce our proved reserves in the years 2022 through
2024.

                                                                                           2022                   2023                  2024

Proved non-producing reserves (PDNP)                                                           303,300                      -                     -
Proved undeveloped reserves (PUD)                                                            5,800,000              5,150,000             4,365,000

Total                                                                                        6,103,300              5,150,000             4,365,000

Common assumptions include such matters as the real extent and average thickness of a particular reservoir, the average porosity and
permeability of the reservoir, the anticipated future production from existing and future wells, future development and production costs and the
ultimate hydrocarbon recovery percentage. As a result, oil and gas reserve estimates and discounted present value estimates are frequently revised
in subsequent periods to reflect production data obtained after the date of the original estimate. If the reserve estimates are inaccurate, production
rates may decline more rapidly than anticipated, and future production revenues may be less than estimated.

Activities (Unaudited), attached to Royale Energy’s Financial Statements, in Note 19.

Historic Development Costs for Proved Reserves

In each year we expend funds to drill and develop some of our proved undeveloped reserves. We have incurred no cost in any of the past three
fiscal years to drill and develop reserves that were classified as proved undeveloped reserves as of December 31 of the immediately preceding
year.

Chevron undertakes no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or
otherwise.
Among the important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are: changing crude oil
and natural gas prices and demand for the company’s products, and production curtailments due to market conditions; crude oil production quotas or
other actions that might be imposed by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and other producing countries; technological
advancements; changes to government policies in the countries in which the company operates; public health crises, such as pandemics (including
coronavirus (COVID-19)) and epidemics, and any related government policies and actions; disruptions in the company’s global supply chain,
including supply chain constraints and escalation of the cost of goods and services; changing economic, regulatory and political environments in the
various countries in which the company operates; general domestic and international economic and political conditions, including the military
conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the global response to such conflict; changing refining, marketing and chemicals margins; actions of
competitors or regulators; timing of exploration expenses; timing of crude oil liftings; the competitiveness of alternate-energy sources or product
substitutes; development of large carbon capture and offset markets; the results of operations and financial condition of the company’s suppliers,
vendors, partners and equity affiliates, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic; the inability or failure of the company’s joint-venture partners to
fund their share of operations and development activities; the potential failure to achieve expected net production from existing and future crude oil
and natural gas development projects; potential delays in the development, construction or start-up of planned projects; the potential disruption or
interruption of the company’s operations due to war, accidents, political events, civil unrest, severe weather, cyber threats, terrorist acts, or other
natural or human causes beyond the company’s control; the potential liability for remedial actions or assessments under existing or future
environmental regulations and litigation; significant operational, investment or product changes undertaken or required by existing or future
environmental statutes and regulations, including international agreements and national or regional legislation and regulatory measures to limit or
reduce greenhouse gas emissions; the potential liability resulting from pending or future litigation; the company’s future acquisitions or dispositions
of assets or shares or the delay or failure of such transactions to close based on required closing conditions; the potential for gains and losses from
asset dispositions or impairments; government mandated sales, divestitures, recapitalizations, taxes and tax audits, tariffs, sanctions, changes in fiscal
terms or restrictions on scope of company operations; foreign currency movements compared with the U.S. dollar; higher inflation and related
impacts; material reductions in corporate liquidity and access to debt markets; the receipt of required Board authorizations to implement capital
allocation strategies, including future stock repurchase programs and dividend payments; the effects of changed accounting rules under generally
accepted accounting principles promulgated by rule-setting bodies; the company’s ability to identify and mitigate the risks and hazards inherent in
operating in the global energy industry; and the factors set forth under the heading “Risk Factors” on pages 20 through 26 in this report. Other
unpredictable or unknown factors not discussed in this report could also have material adverse effects on forward-looking statements.

PART I
Item 1. Business
General Development of Business
Summary Description of Chevron
Chevron Corporation,* a Delaware corporation, manages its investments in subsidiaries and affiliates and provides administrative, financial,
management and technology support to U.S. and international subsidiaries that engage in integrated energy and chemicals operations. Upstream
operations consist primarily of exploring for, developing, producing and transporting crude oil and natural gas; processing, liquefaction,
transportation and regasification associated with liquefied natural gas; transporting crude oil by major international oil export pipelines; transporting,
storage and marketing of natural gas; and a gas-to-liquids plant. Downstream operations consist primarily of refining crude oil into petroleum
products; marketing of crude oil, refined products, and lubricants; manufacturing and marketing of renewable fuels; transporting crude oil and refined
products by pipeline, marine vessel, motor equipment and rail car; and manufacturing and marketing of commodity petrochemicals, plastics for
industrial uses and fuel and lubricant additives.
A list of the company’s significant subsidiaries is presented in Exhibit 21.1.
Overview of Petroleum Industry
Petroleum industry operations and profitability are influenced by many factors. Prices for crude oil, natural gas, liquefied natural gas, petroleum
products and petrochemicals are generally determined by supply and demand. Production levels from the members of Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries (OPEC), Russia and the United States are the major factors in determining worldwide supply. Demand for crude oil and its
products and for natural gas is largely driven by the conditions of local, national and global economies, although weather patterns, the pace of energy
transition and taxation relative to other energy sources also play a significant part. Laws and governmental policies, particularly in the areas of
taxation, energy and the environment, affect where and how companies invest, conduct their operations, select feedstocks, and formulate their
products and, in some cases, limit their profits directly.
Strong competition exists in all sectors of the petroleum and petrochemical industries in supplying the energy, fuel and chemical needs of industry
and individual consumers. In the upstream business, Chevron competes with fully integrated, major global petroleum companies, as well as
independent and national petroleum companies, for the acquisition of crude oil and natural gas leases and other properties and for the equipment and
labor required to develop and operate those properties. In its downstream business, Chevron competes with fully integrated, major petroleum
companies, as well as independent refining and marketing, transportation and chemicals entities and national petroleum companies in the refining,
manufacturing, sale and marketing of fuels, lubricants, additives and petrochemicals.
Operating Environment
Refer to pages 32 through 40 of this Form 10-K in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for a
discussion of the company’s current business environment and outlook.
Chevron’s Strategic Direction
Chevron’s strategy is to leverage our strengths to safely deliver lower carbon energy to a growing world. Our primary objective is to deliver higher
returns, lower carbon and superior shareholder value in any business environment. We are building on our capabilities, assets and customer
relationships as we aim to lead in lower carbon intensity oil, products and natural gas, as well as advance new products and solutions that reduce the
carbon emissions of major industries. We aim to grow our traditional oil and gas business, lower the carbon intensity of our operations and grow new
lower carbon businesses in renewable fuels, hydrogen, carbon capture, offsets, and other emerging technologies.
Information about the company is available on the company’s website at www.chevron.com. Information contained on the company’s website is not

________________________________________________________
*
  Incorporated in Delaware in 1926 as Standard Oil Company of California, the company adopted the name Chevron Corporation in 1984 and ChevronTexaco Corporation in 2001. In 2005, ChevronTexaco
  Corporation changed its name to Chevron Corporation. As used in this report, the term “Chevron” and such terms as “the company,” “the corporation,” “our,” “we,” “us” and "its" may refer to Chevron
  Corporation, one or more of its consolidated subsidiaries, or all of them taken as a whole, but unless stated otherwise they do not include “affiliates” of Chevron — i.e., those companies accounted for by the
  equity method (generally owned 50 percent or less) or non-equity method investments. All of these terms are used for convenience only and are not intended as a precise description of any of the separate
  companies, each of which manages its own affairs.
                                                                                                        3

Hiring, Development and Retention
The company’s approach to attracting, developing and retaining a global, diverse workforce of high-performing talent is anchored in a long-term
employment model that fosters an environment of personal growth and engagement. Chevron’s philosophy is to offer compelling career opportunities
and a competitive total compensation and benefits package linked to individual and enterprise performance. Chevron recruits new employees in part
through partnerships with universities and diversity associations. In addition, the company recruits experienced hires to provide specialized skills.
Chevron’s learning and development programs are designed to help employees achieve their full potential by building technical, operating and
leadership capabilities at all levels to produce energy safely, reliably and efficiently. Chevron’s leadership regularly reviews metrics on employee
training and development programs, which are continually refined to meet the needs of our evolving business. The company invests in developing
leadership at every level. For example, Chevron expanded a coaching program that reaches deeper into the organization, including frontline
supervisors, managers and individual contributors.
In addition, to ensure business continuity, leadership regularly reviews the talent pipeline, identifies and develops succession candidates, and builds
succession plans for key positions. The Board of Directors provides oversight of CEO and executive succession planning.
Management routinely reviews the retention of its professional population, which includes executives, all levels of management, and the majority of
its regular employee population. The annual voluntary attrition for this population was 4.5 percent, which is in line with rates over a five-year
comparison period. The voluntary attrition rate generally excludes employee departures under enterprise-wide restructuring programs. Chevron
believes its low voluntary attrition rate is in part a result of the company’s commitment to employee development, its long-term employment model,
competitive pay and benefits, and its culture.

Diversity and Inclusion
Chevron believes human ingenuity has the power to solve difficult problems when diverse people, ideas and experiences come together in an
inclusive environment. Chevron reinforces the values of diversity and inclusion through recruitment and talent development, equitable selection
processes, community partnerships and supplier diversity. Chevron strives to build an inclusive environment through innovative programs such as the
company’s MARC (Men Advocating Real Change) program launched in 2017, in partnership with the non-profit organization Catalyst, to facilitate
discussions on gender equity in the workplace. MARC is active in over 35 Chevron locations on six continents around the world with over 5,000
participants since inception. Also, when hiring for a position, many selection processes now include inclusion counselors who help check against
unconscious biases and provide outside perspectives.
Chevron’s leadership development also reflects Chevron’s diversity focus. In 2022, Chevron offered numerous leadership programs to promote
leadership diversity, including the Global Women’s Leadership Development Program, Transformational Leadership for Multicultural Women,
Executive Leadership Council (U.S. Black employees), Asia Pacific Leadership Development Program, Asian American Leadership Development
Program, and Latino Leadership Development Program. In addition, Chevron has 11 employee networks (voluntary groups of employees that come
together based on shared identity or interests) and a Chairman’s Inclusion Council, which provides the employee network presidents with a direct line
of communication to the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Human Resources Officer, the Chief Diversity and Inclusion Officer, and
the executive leadership team to collaborate and discuss how employee networks can reinforce Chevron’s values of diversity and inclusion.
Employee Engagement
Employee engagement is an indicator of employee well-being and commitment to the company’s values, purpose and strategies. Chevron regularly
conducts employee surveys to assess the health of the company’s culture; recent surveys indicate high employee engagement. Chevron’s survey
frequency enables the company to better understand employee sentiment throughout the year and gain insights into employee well-being. The
company also introduced surveys to understand employee experience trends throughout the employee lifecycle.
Chevron prioritizes the health, safety and well-being of its employees. Chevron’s safety culture empowers every member of its workforce to exercise
stop-work authority without repercussion to address any potential unsafe work conditions. The company has set clear expectations for leaders to
deliver operational excellence by demonstrating their commitment to prioritizing the safety and health of its workforce, and the protection of
communities, the environment and the company’s assets. Additionally, the company offers long-standing employee support programs such as
Ombuds, an independent resource designed to equip employees with options to address and resolve workplace issues; a company hotline, where
employees can report concerns to the Corporate Compliance department; and an Employee Assistance Program, a confidential consulting service that
can help employees resolve a broad range of personal, family and work-related concerns. In February, Chevron received the 2023 Platinum Bell Seal
for Workplace Mental Health by Mental Health America. The Bell Seal is a first-of-its-kind workplace mental health certification that recognizes
employers who strive to create mentally healthy workplaces for their employees.

Production Outlook
The company estimates its average worldwide oil-equivalent production in 2023, assuming a Brent crude oil price of $80 per barrel, to be flat to up
three percent compared to 2022. This estimate is subject to many factors and uncertainties, as described beginning on page 36. Refer to the Review of
Ongoing Exploration and Production Activities in Key Areas for a discussion of the company’s major crude oil and natural gas development projects.

Net Production of Crude Oil, Natural Gas Liquids and Natural Gas
The following table summarizes the net production of crude oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas for 2022 and 2021 by the company and its
affiliates. Worldwide oil-equivalent production of 3 million barrels per day in 2022 was down approximately 3 percent from 2021. International
production decreased 7 percent in 2022 primarily due to the end of concessions in Thailand and Indonesia, while U.S. production increased 4 percent
compared to 2021, mainly in the Permian Basin. Refer to the Results of Operations section for a detailed discussion of the factors explaining the
changes in production for liquids (including crude oil, condensate, natural gas liquids and synthetic oil) and natural gas, and refer to Table V for
information on annual production by geographical region.

In the United States, the company is contractually committed to deliver approximately 7 million barrels of crude oil and 729 billion cubic feet of
natural gas to third parties from 2023 through 2025. The company believes it can satisfy these contracts through a combination of equity production
from the company’s proved developed U.S. reserves and third-party purchases. These commitments are primarily based on contracts with indexed
pricing terms.
Outside the United States, the company is contractually committed to deliver a total of 2.8 trillion cubic feet of natural gas to third parties from 2023
through 2025 from operations in Australia and Israel. The Australia sales contracts contain variable pricing formulas that generally reference the
prevailing market price for crude oil, natural gas or other petroleum products at the time of delivery. The sales contracts for Israel contain formulas
that generally reflect an initial base price subject to price indexation, Brent-linked or other, over the life of the contract. The company believes it can
satisfy these contracts from quantities available from production of the company’s proved developed reserves in these countries.

Review of Ongoing Exploration and Production Activities in Key Areas
Chevron has exploration and production activities in many of the world’s major hydrocarbon basins. Chevron’s 2022 key upstream activities, some of
which are also discussed in the section Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, are presented
below. The comments include references to “total production” and “net production,” which are defined under “Production” in Exhibit 99.1.
The discussion that follows references the status of proved reserves recognition for significant long-lead-time projects not on production as well as
for projects recently placed on production. Reserves are not discussed for exploration activities or recent discoveries that have not advanced to a
project stage, or for mature areas of production that do not have individual projects requiring significant levels of capital or exploratory investment.

United States
Upstream activities in the United States are primarily located in Texas, New Mexico, Colorado, California, and the Gulf of Mexico. Acreage for the
United States can be found in the Acreage table. Net daily oil-equivalent production in the United States can be found in the Net Production of Crude
Oil, Natural Gas Liquids and Natural Gas table.
As one of the largest producers in the Permian Basin, Chevron continues to capitalize on its advantaged portfolio in west Texas and southeast New
Mexico with an outlook of one million barrels of net oil equivalent production per day by 2025. The asset is comprised of stacked formations
enabling production from multiple geologic zones from single surface locations and staging the development for optimized capacity utilization of
facilities and infrastructure. The company has implemented a factory development strategy utilizing multi-well pads to drill a series of horizontal
wells that are subsequently completed concurrently using hydraulic fracture stimulation. This manufacturing-style process, combined with
advantaged acreage holdings and technological advancements, have enabled capital expenditure productivity improvements. Continued operational
efficiencies and diversified land assets via non-operated joint ventures and royalty positions have also contributed to higher returns throughout the
Permian portfolio. In addition to ongoing emission reduction and water handling initiatives, construction of a 50 percent joint venture solar power
project in New Mexico to supply renewable energy for our oil and gas operations was completed and is expected to be operational in the first half of
2023. In 2022, Chevron’s net daily unconventional production in the Permian Basin averaged 327,000 barrels of crude oil, 184,000 barrels of natural
gas liquids (NGLs) and 1.2 billion cubic feet of natural gas.
Chevron divested its assets in the Eagle Ford Shale in Texas in March 2022.
In Colorado, development in the Denver-Julesburg (DJ) Basin is primarily focused on Chevron’s Mustang and Wells Ranch areas where the
company’s comprehensive drilling plans allow for efficient resource development. In 2022, Chevron’s net daily production in the DJ Basin averaged
53,000 barrels of crude oil, 37,000 barrels of NGLs and 325 million cubic feet of natural gas.
Chevron also has operations in Colorado’s Piceance Basin, as well as an acreage position in Wyoming.
In 2022, 53 wells in Texas and 29 wells in Colorado achieved Project Canary’s highest certification rating on operational and environmental
performance, allowing Chevron to market responsibly sourced natural gas.
In 2022, Chevron was one of the largest crude oil producers in California with a net daily oil equivalent production of 87,800 barrels. The California
operations support Chevron’s efforts to progress its lower carbon technologies with investments in geothermal and carbon capture pilots. These
include the Baseload Capital pilot to utilize waste heat from existing oilfield operations and the Svante pilot to capture carbon dioxide from
combustion of natural gas. These pilots leverage innovative technologies and have the potential to scale across our operations. The Baseload Capital
and Svante pilots became operational in the third and fourth quarters of 2022, respectively.
During 2022, net daily production in the Gulf of Mexico averaged 172,000 barrels of crude oil, 12,000 barrels of NGLs and 101 million cubic feet of
natural gas. Chevron is engaged in various operated and nonoperated exploration, development and production activities in the deepwater Gulf of
Mexico. Chevron also holds nonoperated interests in several shelf fields.
The deepwater Jack and St. Malo fields are being jointly developed with a host floating production unit located between the two fields. Chevron has a
50 percent interest in the Jack Field and a 51 percent interest in the St. Malo Field. Both fields are company operated. The company has a 40.6
percent interest in the production host facility, which is designed to accommodate production from the Jack/St. Malo development and third-party
tiebacks. Additional development opportunities for the Jack and St. Malo fields progressed in 2022. The St. Malo Stage 4 waterflood project includes
two new production wells, three injector wells, and topsides water injection equipment at the St. Malo Field. First water

injection is expected in 2024. Additional Jack development in 2022 consisted of a single well tieback and related subsea infrastructure installation.
The Stage 4 multiphase subsea pump project replaces the single-phase subsea pumps in both the Jack and St. Malo fields. Multiphase pump module
installation commenced in 2022. Proved reserves have been recognized for the multiphase subsea pump project. The Jack and St. Malo fields have an
estimated remaining production life of more than 20 years.
The company has a 15.6 percent nonoperated working interest in the deepwater Mad Dog Field. First oil from the Mad Dog 2 Project is expected to
commence in 2023. Proved reserves have been recognized for the Mad Dog 2 Project.
Chevron has a 60 percent-owned and operated interest in the Big Foot project, located in the deepwater Walker Ridge area. Development drilling
activities are ongoing, with an additional production well that came online in 2022. The project has an estimated remaining production life of more
than 30 years.

Environmental Protection The company designs, operates and maintains its facilities to avoid potential spills or leaks and to minimize the impact of
those that may occur. Chevron requires its facilities and operations to have operating standards and processes and emergency response plans that
address significant risks identified through site-specific risk and impact assessments. Chevron also requires that sufficient resources be available to
execute these plans. In the unlikely event that a major spill or leak occurs, Chevron also maintains a Worldwide Emergency Response Team
comprised of employees who are trained in various aspects of emergency response, including post-incident remediation.
To complement the company’s capabilities, Chevron maintains active membership in international oil spill response cooperatives, including the
Marine Spill Response Corporation, which operates in U.S. territorial waters, and Oil Spill Response, Ltd., which operates globally. The company is
a founding member of the Marine Well Containment Company, whose primary mission is to expediently deploy containment equipment and systems
to capture and contain crude oil in the unlikely event of a future loss of control of a deepwater well in the Gulf of Mexico. In addition, the company is
a member of the Subsea Well Response Project, which has the objective to further develop the industry’s capability to contain and shut in subsea well
control incidents in different regions of the world.

Item 1A. Risk Factors
As a global energy company, Chevron is subject to a variety of risks that could materially impact the company’s results of operations and financial
condition.
BUSINESS AND OPERATIONAL RISK FACTORS
Chevron is exposed to the effects of changing commodity prices Chevron is primarily in a commodities business that has a history of price volatility.
The most significant factor that affects the company’s results of operations is the price of crude oil, which can be influenced by general economic
conditions and level of economic growth, including low or negative growth; industry production and inventory levels; technology advancements,
including those in pursuit of a lower carbon economy; production quotas or other actions that might be imposed by the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries or other producers; weather-related damage and disruptions due to other natural or human causes beyond our control (including
without limitation due to the COVID-19 pandemic); competing fuel prices; geopolitical risks; the pace of energy transition; customer and consumer
preferences and the use of substitutes; and governmental regulations, policies and other actions regarding the development of oil and gas reserves, as
well as greenhouse gas emissions and climate change. Chevron evaluates the risk of changing commodity prices as a core part of its business
planning process. An investment in the company carries significant exposure to fluctuations in global crude oil prices.
Extended periods of low prices for crude oil can have a material adverse impact on the company’s results of operations, financial condition and
liquidity. Among other things, the company’s upstream earnings, cash flows, and capital expenditure programs could be negatively affected, as could
its production and proved reserves. Upstream assets may also become impaired. Downstream earnings could be negatively affected because they
depend upon the supply and demand for refined products and the associated margins on refined product sales. A significant or sustained decline in
liquidity could adversely affect the company’s credit ratings, potentially increase financing costs and reduce access to capital markets. The company
may be unable to realize anticipated cost savings, expenditure reductions and asset sales that are intended to compensate for such downturns, and
such downturns may also slow the pace and scale at which we are able to invest in new business lines such as the lower carbon businesses associated
with our Chevron New Energies organization. In some cases, liabilities associated with divested assets may return to the company when an acquirer
of those assets subsequently declares bankruptcy. In addition, extended periods of low commodity prices can have a material adverse impact on the
results of operations, financial condition and liquidity of the company’s suppliers, vendors, partners and equity affiliates upon which the company’s
own results of operations and financial condition depends.

The scope of Chevron’s business will decline if the company does not successfully develop resources The company is in an extractive business;
therefore, if it is not successful in replacing the crude oil and natural gas it produces with good prospects for future organic opportunities or through
acquisitions, the company’s business will decline. Creating and maintaining an inventory of projects depends on many factors, including obtaining
and renewing rights to explore, develop and produce hydrocarbons; drilling success; reservoir optimization; ability to bring long-lead-time, capital-
intensive projects to completion on budget and on schedule; partner alignment, including strategic support; and efficient and profitable operation of
mature properties.
The company’s operations could be disrupted by natural or human causes beyond its control Chevron operates in both urban areas and remote and
sometimes inhospitable regions. The company’s operations are therefore subject to disruption from natural or human causes beyond its control,
including risks from hurricanes, severe storms, floods, heat waves, other forms of severe weather, wildfires, ambient temperature increases, sea level
rise, war or other military conflicts such as the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, accidents, civil unrest, political events, fires, earthquakes, system failures,
cyber threats, terrorist acts and epidemic or pandemic diseases such as the COVID-19 pandemic, some of which may be impacted by climate change
and any of which could result in suspension of operations or harm to people or the natural environment.
Chevron’s risk management systems are designed to assess potential physical and other risks to its operations and assets and to plan for their
resiliency. While capital investment reviews and decisions incorporate potential ranges of physical risks such as storm severity and frequency, sea
level rise, air and water temperature, precipitation, fresh water access, wind speed, and earthquake severity, among other factors, it is difficult to
predict with certainty the timing, frequency or severity of such events, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company's results of
operations or financial condition.
Impacts of the continuation or further resurgences of the COVID-19 pandemic may have an adverse and potentially material adverse effect on
Chevron’s financial and operating results The economic, business, and oil and gas industry impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic and the
disruption to capital markets have been far reaching. While the oil and gas industry has witnessed a substantial recovery of commodity prices and
demand for products, there continues to be uncertainty and unpredictability about the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our financial and
operating results in future periods. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic adversely impacts our future financial and operating results, and for
what duration and magnitude, depends on several factors that are continuing to evolve, are difficult to predict and, in many instances, are beyond the
company’s control. Such factors include the duration and scope of the pandemic, including any further resurgences of the COVID-19 virus and its
variants, and the impact on our workforce and operations; the negative impact of the pandemic on the economy and economic activity, including
travel restrictions and prolonged low demand for our products; the ability of our affiliates, suppliers and partners to successfully navigate the impacts
of the pandemic; the actions taken by governments, businesses and individuals in response to the pandemic; the actions of OPEC and other countries
that otherwise impact supply and demand and, correspondingly, commodity prices; the extent and duration of recovery of economies and demand for
our products after the pandemic subsides; and Chevron’s ability to keep its cost model in line with changing demand for our products. In-country
conditions, including potential future waves of the COVID-19 virus and its variants in countries that appear to have reduced their infection rates,
could impact logistics and material movement and remain a risk to business continuity.
In light of the significant uncertainty around the duration and extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, management is currently unable to
develop with any level of confidence estimates and assumptions that may have a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial statements
and financial or operational performance in any given period. In addition, the unprecedented nature of such market conditions could cause current
management estimates and assumptions to be challenged in hindsight.
In addition, further resurgences of the pandemic could precipitate or aggravate the other risk factors identified in this Form 10-K, which in turn could
materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and profitability, including in ways not currently
known or considered by us to present significant risks.
Cyberattacks targeting Chevron’s process control networks or other digital infrastructure could have a material adverse impact on the company’s
business and results of operations There are numerous and evolving risks to Chevron’s cybersecurity and privacy from cyber threat actors, including
criminal hackers, state-sponsored intrusions, industrial espionage and employee malfeasance. These cyber threat actors, whether internal or external
to Chevron, are becoming more sophisticated and coordinated in their attempts to access the company’s information technology (IT) systems and
data, including the IT systems of cloud providers and other third parties with whom the company conducts business




                                                                             21
                                                                                                                                           Table of Contents



through, without limitation, malicious software; data privacy breaches by employees, insiders or others with authorized access; cyber or phishing-
attacks; ransomware; attempts to gain unauthorized access to our data and systems; and other electronic security breaches. Although Chevron devotes
significant resources to prevent unwanted intrusions and to protect its systems and data, whether such data is housed internally or by external third
parties, the company has experienced and will continue to experience cyber incidents of varying degrees in the conduct of its business. Cyber threat
actors could compromise the company’s process control networks or other critical systems and infrastructure, resulting in disruptions to its business
operations, injury to people, harm to the environment or its assets, disruptions in access to its financial reporting systems, or loss, misuse or
corruption of its critical data and proprietary information, including without limitation its intellectual property and business information and that of its
employees, customers, partners and other third parties. Any of the foregoing can be exacerbated by a delay or failure to detect a cyber incident or the
full extent of such incident. Further, the company has exposure to cyber incidents and the negative impacts of such incidents related to its critical data
and proprietary information housed on third-party IT systems, including the cloud. Additionally, authorized third-party IT systems or software can be
compromised and used to gain access or introduce malware to Chevron's IT systems that can materially impact the company’s business. Regardless
of the precise method or form, cyber events could result in significant financial losses, legal or regulatory violations, reputational harm, and legal
liability and could ultimately have a material adverse effect on the company’s business and results of operations.
The company’s operations have inherent risks and hazards that require significant and continuous oversight Chevron’s results depend on its
ability to identify and mitigate the risks and hazards inherent to operating in the energy industry. The company seeks to minimize these operational
risks by carefully designing and building its facilities and conducting its operations in a safe and reliable manner. However, failure to manage these
risks effectively could impair our ability to operate and result in unexpected incidents, including releases, explosions or mechanical failures resulting
in personal injury, loss of life, environmental damage, loss of revenues, legal liability and/or disruption to operations. Chevron has implemented and
maintains a system of corporate policies, processes and systems, behaviors and compliance mechanisms to manage safety, health, environmental,
reliability and efficiency risks; to verify compliance with applicable laws and policies; and to respond to and learn from unexpected incidents. In
certain situations where Chevron is not the operator, the company may have limited influence and control over third parties, which may limit its
ability to manage and control such risks.
The company does not insure against all potential losses, which could result in significant financial exposure The company does not have
commercial insurance or third-party indemnities to fully cover all operational risks or potential liability in the event of a significant incident or series
of incidents causing catastrophic loss. As a result, the company is, to a substantial extent, self-insured for such events. The company relies on existing
liquidity, financial resources and borrowing capacity to meet short-term obligations that would arise from such an event or series of events. The
occurrence of a significant incident, series of events, or unforeseen liability for which the company is self-insured, not fully insured or for which
insurance recovery is significantly delayed could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations or financial condition.
LEGAL, REGULATORY AND ESG-RELATED RISK FACTORS
Chevron’s business subjects the company to liability risks from litigation or government action The company produces, transports, refines and
markets potentially hazardous materials, and it purchases, handles and disposes of other potentially hazardous materials in the course of its business.
Chevron's operations also produce byproducts, which may be considered pollutants. Often these operations are conducted through joint ventures over
which the company may have limited influence and control. Any of these activities could result in liability or significant delays in operations arising
from private litigation or government action. For example, liability or delays could result from an accidental, unlawful discharge or from new
conclusions about the effects of the company’s operations on human health or the environment. In addition, to the extent that societal pressures or
political or other factors are involved, it is possible that such liability could be imposed without regard to the company’s causation of or contribution
to the asserted damage, or to other mitigating factors.
For information concerning some of the litigation in which the company is involved, see Note 16 Litigation.
Political instability and significant changes in the legal and regulatory environment could harm Chevron’s business The company’s operations,
particularly exploration and production, can be affected by changing political, regulatory and economic environments in the various countries in
which it operates. As has occurred in the past, actions could be taken by governments to increase public ownership of the company’s partially or
wholly owned businesses, to force contract renegotiations, or to impose additional taxes or royalties. In certain locations, governments have proposed
or imposed




                                                                            22
                                                                                                                                       Table of Contents



restrictions on the company’s operations, trade, currency exchange controls, burdensome taxes, and public disclosure requirements that might harm
the company’s competitiveness or relations with other governments or third parties. In other countries, political conditions have existed that may
threaten the safety of employees and the company’s continued presence in those countries, and internal unrest, acts of violence or strained relations
between a government and the company or other governments may adversely affect the company’s operations. Those developments have, at times,
significantly affected the company’s operations and results and are carefully considered by management when evaluating the level of current and
future activity in such countries. Further, Chevron is required to comply with sanctions and other trade laws and regulations of the United States and
other jurisdictions where we operate which, depending upon their scope, could adversely impact the company’s operations and financial results in
certain countries. In addition, litigation or changes in national, state or local environmental regulations or laws, including those designed to stop or
impede the development or production of oil and gas, such as those related to the use of hydraulic fracturing or bans on drilling, or any law or
regulation that impacts the demand for our products, could adversely affect the company’s current or anticipated future operations and profitability.
Legislative or regulatory changes in tax laws may expose Chevron to additional tax liabilities Changes in tax laws and regulations around the world
are regularly enacted due to political or economic factors beyond the company’s control. Chevron’s taxes in the jurisdictions where the company
conducts business activities have been and may be adversely affected by changes in tax laws or regulations, including but not limited to, substantive
changes in, reductions in, or the repeal or expiration of tax incentives, such as U.S. federal tax incentives for biodiesel blending, which expire in
2024. Furthermore, Chevron’s tax returns are subject to audit by taxing authorities around the world. There is no assurance that taxing authorities or
courts will agree with the positions that Chevron has reflected on the company’s tax returns, in which case interest and penalties could be imposed
that may have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations or financial condition.
During periods of high profitability for certain companies or industries, there are often calls for increased taxes on profits, often called “windfall
profit” taxes. Governments in various jurisdictions, including California and Australia, have announced, proposed, or implemented windfall profit
taxes for companies operating in the energy and oil and gas sectors. Such taxes may be imposed on us or may be increased in the future in these or
other jurisdictions. The imposition of, or increase in, such windfall profit taxes could adversely affect the company’s current or anticipated future
operations and profitability.
For information concerning the company’s tax liabilities, see Note 17 Taxes and Note 24 Other Contingencies and Commitments.
Legislation, regulation, and other government actions and shifting customer and consumer preferences and other private efforts related to
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and climate change could continue to increase Chevron’s operational costs and reduce demand for
Chevron’s hydrocarbon and other products, resulting in a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations and financial condition
Chevron has experienced and may be further challenged by increases in the impacts of international and domestic legislation, regulation, or other
government actions relating to GHG emissions (e.g., carbon dioxide and methane) and climate change. International agreements and national,
regional, and state legislation and regulatory measures that aim to directly or indirectly limit or reduce GHG emissions are in various stages of
implementation.
Legislation, regulation, and other government actions related to GHG emissions and climate change could reduce demand for Chevron’s hydrocarbon
and other products and/or continue to increase Chevron’s operational costs. The Paris Agreement went into effect in November 2016, and a number
of countries in which we operate may adopt additional policies to meet their Paris Agreement goals. Globally, multiple jurisdictions are considering
adopting or are in the process of implementing laws or regulations to directly regulate GHG emissions through similar or other mechanisms, such as
a carbon tax, a cap-and-trade program, or performance standards, or to indirectly advance reduction of GHG emissions through restrictive permitting,
trade tariffs, minimum renewable usage requirements, increased GHG reporting and climate-related disclosure requirements, or tax advantages or
other incentives to promote the use of alternative energy, fuel sources or lower-carbon technologies. For example, the company is currently subject to
implemented programs in certain jurisdictions, such as the Renewable Fuel Standard program in the U.S., California’s Cap-and-Trade Program and
Low Carbon Fuel Standard, and newly approved mandates such as the California Air Resources Board Advanced Clean Cars II regulations, as well
as other indirect regulation of GHG emissions, which may, among other things, ban or restrict technologies or products that use the company’s
hydrocarbon products. GHG emissions that may be directly regulated through such efforts include, among others, those associated with the
company’s exploration and production of




                                                                          23
                                                                                                                                         Table of Contents



hydrocarbons; the upgrading of production from oil sands into synthetic oil; power generation; the conversion of crude oil and natural gas into
refined hydrocarbon products; the processing, liquefaction, and regasification of natural gas; the transportation of crude oil, natural gas, and related
products; and customers’ and consumers’ use of the company’s hydrocarbon products. In addition, the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act (IRA)
implements various incentives for lower carbon activities, including carbon capture and storage and the production of hydrogen and sustainable
aviation fuel. Although the IRA offers incentives that could support certain lower carbon lines of business, those same incentives could negatively
impact demand for our traditional base business of oil and gas products in the future or any existing or future lower carbon business lines. Many of
these actions, as well as customers’ and consumers’ preferences and use of the company’s products or substitute products, and actions taken by the
company’s competitors in response to legislation and regulations, are beyond the company’s control.
Similar to any significant changes in the regulatory environment, climate change-related legislation, regulation, or other government actions may
curtail profitability in the oil and gas sector or render the extraction of the company’s hydrocarbon resources economically infeasible. In particular,
GHG emissions-related legislation, regulations, and other government actions and shifting customer and consumer preferences and other private
efforts aimed at reducing GHG emissions may result in increased and substantial capital, compliance, operating, and maintenance costs and could,
among other things, reduce demand for hydrocarbons and the company’s hydrocarbon-based products; increase demand for lower carbon products
and alternative energy sources; make the company’s products more expensive; adversely affect the economic feasibility of the company’s resources;
impact or limit our business plans; and adversely affect the company’s sales volumes, revenues, margins and reputation. For example, some
jurisdictions are in various stages of design, adoption, and implementation of policies and programs that cap emissions and/or require short-,
medium-, and long-term GHG reductions by operators at the asset or facility level, which may not be technologically feasible, or which could require
significant capital expenditure, increase costs of or limit production and limit Chevron’s ability to cost-effectively reduce GHG emissions across its
global portfolio.
The ultimate effect of international agreements; national, regional, and state legislation and regulation; and government and private actions related to
GHG emissions and climate change on the company’s financial performance, and the timing of these effects, will depend on a number of factors.
Such factors include, among others, the sectors covered, the GHG emissions reductions required, the extent to which Chevron would be entitled to
receive emission allowance allocations or would need to purchase compliance instruments on the open market or through auctions, the price and
availability of emission allowances and credits and the extent to which the company is able to recover, or continue to recover, the costs incurred
through the pricing of the company’s products in the competitive marketplace. Further, the ultimate impact of GHG emissions and climate change-
related agreements, legislation, regulation, and government actions on the company’s financial performance is highly uncertain because the company
is unable to predict with certainty, for a multitude of individual jurisdictions, the outcome of political decision-making processes, including the actual
laws and regulations enacted, the variables and tradeoffs that inevitably occur in connection with such processes, and market conditions.
Increasing attention to environmental, social, and governance (ESG) matters may impact our business Increasing attention to ESG matters,
including those related to climate change and sustainability, increasing societal, investor and legislative pressure on companies to address ESG
matters, and potential customer and consumer use of substitutes to Chevron’s products may result in changes to the portfolio of company activities,
increased costs, reduced demand for our products, reduced profits, increased investigations and litigation or threats thereof, negative impacts on our
stock price and access to capital markets, and damage to our reputation. Increasing attention to climate change, for example, may result in demand
shifts for our hydrocarbon products and additional governmental investigations and private litigation, or threats thereof, against the company. For
instance, we have received investigative requests and demands from the U.S. Congress for information relating to climate change, methane leak
detection and repair, and other topics, and further requests and/or demands are possible. At this time, Chevron cannot predict the ultimate impact any
Congressional or other investigations may have on the company.
Some stakeholders, including but not limited to sovereign wealth, pension, and endowment funds, have been divesting and promoting divestment of
or screening out of fossil fuel equities and urging lenders to limit funding to companies engaged in the extraction of fossil fuel reserves. Further,
voluntary carbon-related and target-setting frameworks have developed, and continue to develop, that limit the ability of certain sectors, including the
oil and gas sector, from participating, and may result in exclusion of the company’s equity from being included as an investment option in portfolios.
In addition, some stakeholders, including some of our investors, have divergent views on our ESG-related strategies and priorities, vis-à-vis our
traditional and lower carbon lines of business, calling for focus on increased production of oil and gas products




                                                                           24
                                                                                                                                            Table of Contents



rather than new business lines and climate-related targets. These circumstances, among others, may result in pressure from activists on production;
unfavorable reputational impacts, including inaccurate perceptions or a misrepresentation of our actual ESG policies and practices; diversion of
management’s attention and resources; and proxy fights, among other material adverse impacts on our businesses.
In addition, organizations that provide information to investors on corporate governance and related matters have developed ratings processes for
evaluating companies on their approach to ESG matters, including climate change and climate-related risks (including entities commonly referred to
as “raters and rankers”). Such ratings are used by some investors to inform their investment and voting decisions. Unfavorable ESG ratings and
investment community divestment initiatives, among other actions, may lead to negative investor sentiment toward Chevron and to the diversion of
investment to other industries, which could have a negative impact on our stock price and our access to and costs of capital. Additionally, evolving
expectations on various ESG matters, including biodiversity, waste and water, may increase costs, require changes in how we operate and lead to
negative stakeholder sentiment.
Our aspirations, targets and disclosures related to ESG matters subject us to numerous risks that may negatively impact our reputation and stock
price or result in other material adverse impacts to the company Chevron has announced an aspiration to achieve net zero Scope 1 and 2 emissions
in upstream by 2050. The company also has set nearer-term GHG emission-related targets for zero routine flaring, upstream carbon intensity, and
portfolio carbon intensity. These and other aspirations, targets or objectives reflect our current plans and aspirations and are not guarantees that we
will achieve them, particularly as we encounter new opportunities and/or limitations as our portfolio and market conditions evolve.
Our ability to achieve any aspiration, target or objective, including with respect to climate-related initiatives, our new lower carbon strategy outlined
in the Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, pages 32 through 34, and any lower carbon new
energy businesses, is subject to numerous risks, many of which are outside of our control. Examples of such risks include: (1) the continuing progress
of commercially viable technologies and low- or non-carbon-based energy sources; (2) the granting of necessary permits by governing authorities; (3)
the availability and acceptability of cost-effective, verifiable carbon credits; (4) the availability of suppliers that can meet our sustainability and other
standards; (5) evolving regulatory requirements affecting ESG standards or disclosures; (6) evolving standards for tracking and reporting on
emissions and emission reductions and removals; (7) customers’ and consumers’ preferences and use of the company’s products or substitute
products; and (8) actions taken by the company’s competitors in response to legislation and regulations.
The standards for tracking and reporting on ESG matters are relatively new, have not been harmonized and continue to evolve. Our selection of
disclosure frameworks that seek to align with various voluntary reporting standards may change from time to time and may result in a lack of
comparative data from period to period. In addition, our processes and controls may not always align with evolving voluntary standards for
identifying, measuring, and reporting ESG metrics, our interpretation of reporting standards may differ from those of others, and such standards may
change over time, any of which could result in significant revisions to our goals or reported progress in achieving such goals. Achievement of or
efforts to achieve aspirations, targets, goals and objectives such as the foregoing and future internal climate-related initiatives may increase costs,
require purchase of carbon credits, or limit or impact the company’s business plans, operations and financial results, potentially resulting in the
reduction to the economic end-of-life of certain assets, an impairment of the associated net book value, among other material adverse impacts. Our
failure or perceived failure to pursue or fulfill such aspirations, targets, goals and objectives or to satisfy various reporting standards within the
timelines we announce, or at all, could have a negative impact on the company’s reputation, investor sentiment, ratings outcomes for evaluating the
company’s approach to ESG matters, stock price, and cost of capital and expose us to government enforcement actions and private litigation, among
other material adverse impacts.
GENERAL RISK FACTORS
Changes in management’s estimates and assumptions may have a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial statements and
financial or operational performance in any given period In preparing the company’s periodic reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
including its financial statements, Chevron’s management is required under applicable rules and regulations to make estimates and assumptions as of
a specified date. These estimates and assumptions are based on management’s best estimates and experience as of that date and are subject to
substantial risk and uncertainty. Materially different results may occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known. Areas
requiring significant estimates and assumptions by management include impairments to property, plant and equipment and investments in affiliates;
estimates of crude oil and natural gas recoverable reserves; accruals for estimated

liabilities, including litigation reserves; and measurement of benefit obligations for pension and other postretirement benefit plans. Changes in
estimates or assumptions or the information underlying the assumptions, such as changes in the company’s business plans, general market conditions,
the pace of energy transition, or changes in the company’s outlook on commodity prices, could affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities or
expenses.

As previously disclosed, the California Department of Fish and Game, Office of Spill Prevention and Response issued a Complaint - Notice of
Violation (NOV) to Chevron for alleged violations related to oil spills and impacted habitat and species occurring between January 2018 and May
2022 at different Chevron fields within Kern County, California. Resolution of the alleged violations may result in the payment of a civil penalty of
$1.0 million or more.
As previously disclosed, the California Department of Conservation, California Geologic Energy Management Division (CalGEM) (previously
known as the Division of Oil, Gas and Geothermal Resources) promulgated revised rules pursuant to the Underground Injection Control program that
took effect April 1, 2019. Subsequent to that date, CalGEM issued NOVs and two orders to Chevron related to seeps that occurred in the Cymric Oil
Field in Kern County, California. An October 2, 2019 CalGEM order seeks a civil penalty of approximately $2.7 million. Chevron has filed an appeal
of this order. Chevron is currently in discussions with CalGEM to explore a global settlement to resolve the order and all past and present seeps in the
Cymric Field, which would increase the amount of penalty paid.

Business Environment and Outlook
Chevron Corporation is a global energy company with substantial business activities in the following countries: Angola, Argentina, Australia,
Bangladesh, Brazil, Canada, China, Egypt, Equatorial Guinea, Israel, Kazakhstan, Mexico, Nigeria, the Partitioned Zone between Saudi Arabia and
Kuwait, the Philippines, Republic of Congo, Singapore, South Korea, Thailand, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Venezuela.
The company’s objective is to safely deliver higher returns, lower carbon and superior shareholder value in any business environment. Earnings of
the company depend mostly on the profitability of its upstream business segment. The most significant factor affecting the results of operations for
the upstream segment is the price of crude oil, which is determined in global markets outside of the company’s control. In the company’s downstream
business, crude oil is the largest cost component of refined products. Periods of sustained lower commodity prices could result in the impairment or
write-off of specific assets in future periods and cause the company to adjust operating expenses, including employee reductions, and capital
expenditures, along with other measures intended to improve financial performance.
Governments, companies, communities, and other stakeholders are increasingly supporting efforts to address climate change. International initiatives
and national, regional and state legislation and regulations that aim to directly or indirectly reduce GHG emissions are in various stages of design,
adoption, and implementation. These policies and programs, some of which support the global net zero emissions ambitions of the Paris Agreement,
can change the amount of energy consumed, the rate of energy-demand growth, the energy mix, and the relative economics of one fuel versus
another. Implementation of jurisdiction-specific policies and programs can be dependent on, and can affect the pace of, technological advancements,
the granting of necessary permits by governing authorities, the availability of cost-effective, verifiable carbon credits, the availability of suppliers that
can meet sustainability and other standards, evolving regulatory or other requirements affecting ESG standards or other disclosures, and evolving
standards for tracking and reporting on emissions and emission reductions and removals.
Some of these policies and programs include renewable and low carbon fuel standards, such as the Renewable Fuel Standard program in the U.S. and
California’s Low Carbon Fuel Standard; programs that price GHG emissions, including


                                                                                      32
Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations                                         Financial Table of Contents



California’s Cap-and-Trade Program; performance standards, including methane-specific regulation such as the U.S. EPA’s forthcoming New Source
Performance Standard and Emissions Guidelines for Existing Sources; and measures that provide various incentives for lower carbon activities,
including carbon capture and storage and the production of hydrogen and sustainable aviation fuel, such as the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act.
Requirements for these and other similar policies and programs are complex, ever changing, program specific and encompass: (1) the blending of
renewable fuels into transportation fuels; (2) the purchasing, selling, utilizing and retiring of allowances and carbon credits; and (3) other emissions
reduction measures including efficiency improvements and capturing GHG emissions. While these compliance policies and programs may have
negative impacts on the company now and in the future including, but not limited to, the displacement of hydrocarbon and other products, these
policies have also enabled opportunities for Chevron as it grows and aims to further grow its lower carbon businesses. For example, the acquisition of
Renewable Energy Group, Inc. (REG) in 2022 grew the company’s renewable fuels production capacity and increased the company’s carbon credit
generation activities. Although we expect the company’s costs to comply with these policies and programs to continue to increase, these costs
currently do not have a material impact on the company’s financial condition or results of operations.
Significant uncertainty remains as to the pace in which the transition to a lower carbon future will progress, which is dependent, in part, on further
advancements and changes in policy, technology, and customer and consumer preferences. The level of expenditure required to comply with new or
potential climate change-related laws and regulations and the amount of additional investments needed in new or existing technology or facilities,
such as carbon capture and storage, is difficult to predict with certainty and is expected to vary depending on the actual laws and regulations enacted,
available technology options, customer and consumer preferences, the company’s activities, and market conditions. As discussed below, in 2021, the
company announced planned capital spend of approximately $10 billion through 2028 in lower carbon investments. Although the future is uncertain,
many published outlooks conclude that fossil fuels will remain a significant part of an energy system that increasingly incorporates lower carbon
sources of supply for many years to come.
Chevron supports the Paris Agreement’s global approach to governments addressing climate change and continues to take actions to help lower the
carbon intensity of its operations while continuing to meet the demand for energy. Chevron believes that broad, market-based mechanisms are the
most efficient approach to addressing GHG emission reductions. Chevron integrates climate change-related issues and the regulatory and other
responses to these issues into its strategy and planning, capital investment reviews, and risk management tools and processes, where it believes they
are applicable. They are also factored into the company’s long-range supply, demand, and energy price forecasts. These forecasts reflect estimates of
long-range effects from climate change-related policy actions, such as electric vehicle and renewable fuel penetration, energy efficiency standards,
and demand response to oil and natural gas prices.
The company will continue to develop oil and gas resources to meet customers’ and consumers’ demand for energy. At the same time, Chevron
believes that the future of energy is lower carbon. The company will continue to maintain flexibility in its portfolio to be responsive to changes in
policy, technology, and customer and consumer preferences. Chevron aims to grow its traditional oil and gas business, lower the carbon intensity of
its operations and grow lower carbon businesses in renewable fuels, hydrogen, carbon capture, offsets, and other emerging technologies. To grow its
lower carbon businesses, Chevron plans to target sectors of the economy where emissions are harder to abate or that cannot be easily electrified,
while leveraging the company’s capabilities, assets and customer relationships. The company’s traditional oil and gas business may increase or
decrease depending upon regulatory or market forces, among other factors.
In 2021, Chevron announced the following aspiration and targets that are aligned with its lower carbon strategy:
2050 Net Zero Upstream Aspiration Chevron aspires to achieve net zero for upstream production Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions on an equity basis
by 2050. The company believes accomplishing this aspiration depends on, among other things, partnerships with multiple stakeholders including
customers, continuing progress on commercially viable technology, government policy, successful negotiations for carbon capture and storage and
nature-based projects, availability and acceptability of cost-effective, verifiable offsets in the global market, and granting of necessary permits by
governing authorities.
2028 Upstream Production GHG Intensity Targets These metrics include Scope 1, direct emissions, and Scope 2, indirect emissions from imported
electricity and steam, and are net of emissions from exported electricity and steam. The targeted 2028 reductions from 2016 on an equity ownership
basis include a:
     •    40 percent reduction in oil production GHG intensity to 24 kilograms (kg) carbon dioxide equivalent per barrel of oil-equivalent (CO2e/boe),
     •    26 percent reduction in gas production GHG intensity to 24 kg CO2e/boe,


                                                                                33
Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations                                            Financial Table of Contents



     •    53 percent reduction in methane intensity to 2 kg CO2e/boe, and
     •    66 percent reduction in flaring GHG intensity to 3 kg CO2e/boe.
The company also targets no routine flaring by 2030. We have set 2016 as our baseline to align with the year the Paris Agreement entered into force,
and the company plans to update the metrics every five years in line with the Paris Agreement stocktakes. We believe these updates will provide
additional transparency on the company’s progress toward its net zero aspiration.
2028 Portfolio Carbon Intensity Target The company also introduced a portfolio carbon intensity (PCI) metric, which is a measure of the carbon
intensity across the full value chain of Chevron’s entire business. This metric encompasses the company’s upstream and downstream business and
includes Scope 1 (direct emissions), Scope 2 (indirect emissions from imported electricity and steam), and certain Scope 3 (primarily emissions from
use of sold products) emissions. The company’s PCI target is 71 grams (g) carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) per megajoule (MJ) by 2028, a greater
than five percent reduction from 2016.
Planned Lower-Carbon Capital Spend through 2028 In 2021, the company established planned capital spend of approximately $10 billion through
2028 to advance its lower carbon strategy, which includes approximately $2 billion to lower the carbon intensity of its traditional oil and gas
operations, and approximately $8 billion for lower carbon investments in renewable fuels, hydrogen and carbon capture and offsets. We anticipate
setting additional capital spending targets as the company progresses toward its 2050 upstream production Scope 1 and 2 net zero aspiration and
further grows its lower carbon business lines.
During 2021 and 2022, the company spent $4.8 billion in lower carbon investments, including $2.9 billion associated with the acquisition of REG.
Refer to “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A, on pages 20 through 26 for further discussion of GHG regulation and climate change and the associated
risks to Chevron’s business, including the risks impacting Chevron’s lower carbon strategy and its aspirations, targets and plans.
Income Taxes The effective tax rate for the company can change substantially during periods of significant earnings volatility. This is due to the mix
effects that are impacted by both the absolute level of earnings or losses and whether they arise in higher or lower tax rate jurisdictions. As a result, a
decline or increase in the effective income tax rate in one period may not be indicative of expected results in future periods. Additional information
related to the company’s effective income tax rate is included in Note 17 Taxes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), enacted in the United States on August 16, 2022, imposes several new taxes that will be effective in 2023,
including a 15 percent minimum tax on book income and a 1 percent excise tax on stock repurchases. The IRA also implements various incentives
for lower carbon activities, including carbon capture and storage and the production of hydrogen and sustainable aviation fuel, and extends the
federal biodiesel mixture excise tax credit through December 31, 2024. We do not currently expect the IRA to have a material impact on our results
of operations.
Supply Chain and Inflation Impacts The company is actively managing its contracting, procurement, and supply chain activities to effectively
manage costs and facilitate supply chain resiliency and continuity in support of the company’s operational goals. Third party costs for capital,
exploration, and operating expenses can be subject to external factors beyond the company’s control including, but not limited to: severe weather or
civil unrest, delays in construction, global and local supply chain distribution issues, inflation, tariffs or other taxes imposed on goods or services, and
market-based prices charged by the industry’s material and service providers. Chevron utilizes contracts with various pricing mechanisms, which may
result in a lag before the company’s costs reflect changes in market trends.
Inflation continued to be a key factor impacting the economy over the last year. For key oil and gas industry inputs (e.g. rigs, well services, etc.),
markets are likely to remain tight with any upward pressure tied directly to possible increases in activity. In contrast, inflationary pressures have
started to reduce for non-oil and gas specific goods and services as a result of reduced supply chain disruptions and a slowdown in economic activity.
Chevron’s 2023 capital expenditure budget assumes cost inflation that averages in the mid-single digits with certain areas higher, such as in the
Permian Basin that assumes low double-digit cost inflation. Chevron believes it is well positioned to manage its costs for 2023, in large part due to
indexed contracts and secured supplies for critical inputs.

Refer to the “Cautionary Statements Relevant to Forward-Looking Information” on page 2 and to “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A, on pages 20
through 26 for a discussion of some of the inherent risks that could materially impact the company’s results of operations or financial condition.
Other Impacts The company continually evaluates opportunities to dispose of assets that are not expected to provide sufficient long-term value and
to acquire assets or operations complementary to its asset base to help augment the company’s financial performance and value growth. Asset
dispositions and restructurings may result in significant gains or losses in future periods.
The company closely monitors developments in the financial and credit markets, the level of worldwide economic activity, and the implications for
the company of movements in prices for crude oil and natural gas. Management takes these developments into account in the conduct of daily
operations and for business planning.
The COVID-19 pandemic caused a significant decrease in demand for our products and created disruptions and volatility in the global marketplace
beginning late in first quarter 2020. Demand has largely recovered as of year-end 2022; however, there continues to be uncertainty around the extent
to which the COVID-19 pandemic may impact our future results, which could be material.
Earnings trends for the company’s major business areas are described as follows:
Upstream Earnings for the upstream segment are closely aligned with industry prices for crude oil and natural gas. Crude oil and natural gas prices
are subject to external factors over which the company has no control, including product demand connected with global economic conditions,
industry production and inventory levels, technology advancements, production quotas or other actions imposed by OPEC+ countries, actions of
regulators, weather-related damage and disruptions, competing fuel prices, natural and human causes beyond the company’s control such as the
COVID-19 pandemic, and regional supply interruptions or fears thereof that may be caused by military conflicts, civil unrest or political uncertainty.
Any of these factors could also inhibit the company’s production capacity in an affected region. The company closely monitors developments in the
countries in which it operates and holds investments and seeks to manage risks in operating its facilities and businesses.
The longer-term trend in earnings for the upstream segment is also a function of other factors, including the company’s ability to find or acquire and
efficiently produce crude oil and natural gas, changes in fiscal terms of contracts, the pace of energy transition, and changes in tax, environmental and
other applicable laws and regulations.
Chevron has interests in Venezuelan assets operated by independent affiliates. Chevron has been conducting limited activities in Venezuela consistent
with the authorization provided pursuant to general licenses issued by the United States government. In fourth quarter 2022, Chevron received
License 41 from the United States government, enabling the company to resume activity in Venezuela subject to certain limitations. The financial
results for Chevron’s business in Venezuela are being recorded as non-equity investments since 2020, where income is only recognized when cash is
received and production and reserves are not included in the company's results. Crude oil liftings in Venezuela commenced in first quarter 2023,
which are expected to positively impact the company’s results going forward.
Caspian Pipeline Consortium (CPC), an equity affiliate, operates a 935-mile crude oil export pipeline from the Tengiz Field in Kazakhstan to tanker-
loading facilities at Novorossiysk on the Russian coast of the Black Sea, providing the main export route for crude oil production from TCO,
Karachaganak and other producing fields in Kazakhstan. The tanker loading facilities at Novorossiysk consist of three single point mooring facilities,
with availability of two or more required to operate at full capacity. CPC is capable of operating at approximately 70 percent of capacity with one
single point mooring facility in service. Two of the three offshore loading moorings at the CPC marine terminal were taken out of service during
August 2022 for equipment repairs identified during normal maintenance. Repairs were completed in fourth quarter 2022. Production at TCO was not
impacted by this CPC outage given turnaround activity at TCO and at other regional producers that ship through CPC. However, there is a risk that
production from TCO could be curtailed in the future should availability of export facilities be constrained.
Governments (including Russia) have imposed and may impose additional sanctions and other trade laws, restrictions and regulations that could lead
to disruption in our ability to produce, transport and/or export crude in the region around Russia and could have an adverse effect on CPC operations
and/or the company’s financial position. The financial impacts of such risks, including presently imposed sanctions, are not currently material for the
company; however, it remains uncertain how long these conditions may last or how severe they may become.

Commodity Prices The following chart shows the trend in benchmark prices for Brent crude oil, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil and U.S.
Henry Hub natural gas. The Brent price averaged $101 per barrel for the full-year 2022, compared to $71 in 2021. As of mid-February 2023, the
Brent price was $85 per barrel. The WTI price averaged $95 per barrel for the full-year 2022, compared to $68 in 2021. As of mid-February 2023,
the WTI price was $79 per barrel. The majority of the company’s equity crude production is priced based on the Brent benchmark.




Crude prices increased in 2022 driven by geopolitical risk, supply decisions by OPEC+ and continued demand recovery due to the further easing of
COVID-19 restrictions. The company’s average realization for U.S. crude oil and natural gas liquids in 2022 was $77 per barrel, up 37 percent from
2021. The company’s average realization for international crude oil and natural gas liquids in 2022 was $91 per barrel, up 41 percent from 2021.
In contrast to price movements in the global market for crude oil, prices for natural gas are also impacted by regional supply and demand and
infrastructure conditions in local markets. In the United States, prices at Henry Hub averaged $6.36 per thousand cubic feet (MCF) during 2022,
compared with $3.85 per MCF during 2021. As of mid-February 2023, the Henry Hub spot price was $2.40 per MCF. (See page 43 for the
company’s average natural gas realizations for the U.S.).
Outside the United States, prices for natural gas also depend on a wide range of supply, demand and regulatory circumstances. The company’s long-
term contract prices for liquefied natural gas (LNG) are typically linked to crude oil prices. Most of the equity LNG offtake from the operated
Australian LNG projects is committed under binding long-term contracts, with some sold in the Asian spot LNG market. International natural gas
realizations averaged $9.75 per MCF during 2022, compared with $5.93 per MCF during 2021, mainly due to higher LNG prices.
Production The company’s worldwide net oil-equivalent production in 2022 was 3 million barrels per day. About 27 percent of the company’s net
oil-equivalent production in 2022 occurred in OPEC+ member countries of Angola, Equatorial Guinea, Kazakhstan, Nigeria, the Partitioned Zone
between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait and Republic of Congo.
The company estimates its net oil-equivalent production in 2023, assuming a Brent crude oil price of $80 per barrel, to be flat to up 3 percent
compared to 2022. This estimate is subject to many factors and uncertainties, including quotas or other actions that may be imposed by OPEC+; price
effects on entitlement volumes; changes in fiscal terms or restrictions on the scope of company operations; delays in construction; reservoir
performance; greater-than-expected declines in production from mature fields; start-up or ramp-up of projects; fluctuations in demand for crude oil
and natural gas in various markets; weather conditions that may shut in production; civil unrest; changing geopolitics; delays in completion of
maintenance turnarounds; storage constraints or economic conditions that could lead to shut-in production; or other disruptions to operations. The
outlook for future production levels is also affected by the size and number of economic investment opportunities and the time lag between initial
exploration and the beginning of production. The company has increased its investment emphasis on short-cycle projects.

Proved Reserves Net proved reserves for consolidated companies and affiliated companies totaled 11.2 billion barrels of oil-equivalent at year-end
2022, a slight decrease from year-end 2021. The reserve replacement ratio in 2022 was 97 percent. The 5 and 10 year reserve replacement ratios were
92 percent and 99 percent, respectively. Refer to Table V for a tabulation of the company’s proved net oil and gas reserves by geographic area, at the
beginning of 2020 and each year-end from 2020 through 2022, and an accompanying discussion of major changes to proved reserves by geographic
area for the three-year period ending December 31, 2022.
Refer to the “Results of Operations” section on pages 39 and 40 for additional discussion of the company’s upstream business.
Downstream Earnings for the downstream segment are closely tied to margins on the refining, manufacturing and marketing of products that include
gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, lubricants, fuel oil, fuel and lubricant additives, petrochemicals and renewable fuels. Industry margins are sometimes volatile
and can be affected by the global and regional supply-and-demand balance for refined products and petrochemicals, and by changes in the price of
crude oil, other refinery and petrochemical feedstocks, and natural gas. Industry margins can also be influenced by inventory levels, geopolitical
events, costs of materials and services, refinery or chemical plant capacity utilization, maintenance programs, and disruptions at refineries or
chemical plants resulting from unplanned outages due to severe weather, fires or other operational events.
Other factors affecting profitability for downstream operations include the reliability and efficiency of the company’s refining, marketing and
petrochemical assets, the effectiveness of its crude oil and product supply functions, and the volatility of tanker-charter rates for the company’s
shipping operations, which are driven by the industry’s demand for crude oil and product tankers. Other factors beyond the company’s control include
the general level of inflation and energy costs to operate the company’s refining, marketing and petrochemical assets, and changes in tax,
environmental, and other applicable laws and regulations.
Refining margins were higher in 2022 because of recovering demand for refined products, low product inventories, lower industry refining capacity
and lower product exports from Russia and China. Refining utilization was strong in 2022 to keep pace with demand growth. Although refining
margins were elevated and still remain above historical levels, they fell considerably in late 2022. There are signs that higher refined product prices
and concerns over macroeconomic conditions are slowing demand.
The company’s most significant marketing areas are the West Coast and Gulf Coast of the United States and Asia Pacific. Chevron operates or has
significant ownership interests in refineries in each of these areas. Additionally, the company has a growing presence in renewable fuels after
acquiring REG.
Refer to the “Results of Operations” section on page 40 for additional discussion of the company’s downstream operations.
All Other consists of worldwide cash management and debt financing activities, corporate administrative functions, insurance operations, real estate
activities and technology companies.

U.S. upstream reported earnings of $12.6 billion in 2022, compared with $7.3 billion in 2021. The increase was due to higher realizations of $6.6
billion and higher sales volumes of $380 million, partially offset by higher operating expenses of $1.1 billion largely due to an early contract
termination at Sabine Pass and lower asset sale gains of $670 million.
The company’s average realization for U.S. crude oil and natural gas liquids in 2022 was $76.71 per barrel compared with $56.06 in 2021. The
average natural gas realization was $5.55 per thousand cubic feet in 2022, compared with $3.11 in 2021.
Net oil-equivalent production in 2022 averaged 1.18 million barrels per day, up 4 percent from 2021. The increase was primarily due to net
production increases in the Permian Basin.
The net liquids component of oil-equivalent production for 2022 averaged 888,000 barrels per day, up 3 percent from 2021. Net natural gas
production averaged 1.76 billion cubic feet per day in 2022, an increase of 4 percent from 2021.

International upstream reported earnings of $17.7 billion in 2022, compared with $8.5 billion in 2021. The increase was primarily due to higher
realizations of $10.0 billion, lower operating expenses, lower depreciation, depletion and amortization related to end of concessions in Indonesia and
Thailand of $1.3 billion and asset sale gains of $220 million. This was partially offset by lower sales volumes of $1.3 billion (also largely associated
with the end of concessions in Indonesia and Thailand) and write-off and impairment charges of $1.1 billion. Foreign currency effects had a favorable
impact on earnings of $514 million between periods.
The company’s average realization for international crude oil and natural gas liquids in 2022 was $90.71 per barrel compared with $64.53 in 2021.
The average natural gas realization was $9.75 per thousand cubic feet in 2022 compared with $5.93 in 2021.
International net oil-equivalent production was 1.82 million barrels per day in 2022, down 7 percent from 2021. The decrease was primarily due to
lower production following expiration of the Erawan concession in Thailand and Rokan concession in Indonesia.
The net liquids component of international oil-equivalent production was 831,000 barrels per day in 2022, a decrease of 13 percent from 2021.
International net natural gas production of 5.92 billion cubic feet per day in 2022, a decrease of 2 percent from 2021.

U.S. downstream reported earnings of $5.4 billion in 2022, compared with $2.4 billion in 2021. The increase was primarily due to higher margins on
refined product sales of $4.4 billion, partially offset by lower earnings from the 50 percent-owned CPChem of $790 million and higher operating
expenses of $790 million, largely due to planned turnarounds.
Total refined product sales of 1.23 million barrels per day in 2022 increased 8 percent from 2021, mainly due to higher renewable fuel sales
following the REG acquisition and higher jet fuel demand.

International downstream earned $2.8 billion in 2022, compared with $525 million in 2021. The increase in earnings was mainly due to higher
margins on refined product sales of $2.7 billion and a favorable swing in foreign currency effects of $50 million between periods, partially offset by
higher operating expenses of $650 million, largely due to transportation costs.
Total refined product sales of 1.39 million barrels per day in 2022 were up 5 percent from 2021, mainly due to higher jet fuel demand as travel
restrictions associated with the COVID-19 pandemic continue to ease.

Net charges in 2022 decreased $133 million from 2021. The change between periods was mainly due to lower pension settlement expense, loss on
early debt retirement and lower interest expense, partially offset by the absence of 2021 favorable tax items and higher interest income. Foreign
currency effects increased net charges by $201 million between periods.

The increase in income tax expense in 2022 of $8.1 billion is due to the increase in total income before tax for the company of $28.0 billion. The
increase in income before taxes for the company is primarily the result of higher upstream realizations and downstream margins.
U.S. income before tax increased from $9.7 billion in 2021 to $21.0 billion in 2022. This $11.3 billion increase in income was primarily driven by
higher upstream realizations and downstream margins, partially offset by higher operating expenses and lower asset sale gains. The increase in
income had a direct impact on the company’s U.S. income tax resulting in an increase to tax expense of $2.9 billion between year-over-year periods,
from $1.6 billion in 2021 to $4.5 billion in 2022.
International income before tax increased from $12.0 billion in 2021 to $28.7 billion in 2022. This $16.7 billion increase in income was primarily
driven by higher upstream realizations and downstream margins. The increased income primarily drove the $5.2 billion increase in international
income tax expense between year-over-year periods, from $4.3 billion in 2021 to $9.6 billion in 2022.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
Sources and Uses of Cash The strength of the company’s balance sheet enables it to fund any timing differences throughout the year between cash
inflows and outflows.
Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities Total balances were $17.9 billion and $5.7 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
Cash provided by operating activities in 2022 was $49.6 billion, compared to $29.2 billion in 2021, primarily due to higher upstream realizations and
refining margins. Cash provided by operating activities was net of contributions to employee pension plans of approximately $1.3 billion in 2022 and
$1.8 billion in 2021. Proceeds and deposits related to asset sales totaled $1.4 billion in each of the last two years. Returns of investment totaled $1.2
billion and $439 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively. The returns of investment in 2022 were primarily from Angola LNG. As of third quarter
2022, Angola LNG distributions were, and are expected to continue to be, largely reflected in cash flow from operations. Cash flow from financing
activities includes proceeds from shares issued for stock options of $5.8 billion in 2022, compared with $1.4 billion in 2021. Future cash proceeds
from option exercises are expected to be lower than in 2022.
Restricted cash of $1.4 billion and $1.2 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, was held in cash and short-term marketable securities
and recorded as “Deferred charges and other assets” and “Prepaid expenses and other current assets” on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. These
amounts are generally associated with upstream decommissioning activities, tax payments and funds held in escrow for tax-deferred exchanges.
Dividends Dividends paid to common stockholders were $11.0 billion in 2022 and $10.2 billion in 2021.
Debt and Finance Lease Liabilities Total debt and finance lease liabilities were $23.3 billion at December 31, 2022, down from $31.4 billion at year-
end 2021.
The $8.1 billion decrease in total debt and finance lease liabilities during 2022 was primarily due to the repayment of long-term notes that matured
during the year and the early retirement of long-term notes. The company’s debt and finance lease liabilities due within one year, consisting primarily
of the current portion of long-term debt and redeemable long-term obligations, totaled $6.0 billion at December 31, 2022, compared with $8.0 billion
at year-end 2021. Of these amounts, $4.1 billion and $7.8 billion were reclassified to long-term debt at the end of 2022 and 2021, respectively.
At year-end 2022, settlement of these obligations was not expected to require the use of working capital in 2023, as the company had the intent and
the ability, as evidenced by committed credit facilities, to refinance them on a long-term basis.
The company has access to a commercial paper program as a financing source for working capital or other short-term needs. The company had no
commercial paper outstanding as of December 31, 2022.
The company has an automatic shelf registration statement that expires in August 2023 for an unspecified amount of nonconvertible debt securities
issued by Chevron Corporation or Chevron U.S.A. Inc. (CUSA).

The major debt rating agencies routinely evaluate the company’s debt, and the company’s cost of borrowing can increase or decrease depending on
these debt ratings. The company has outstanding public bonds issued by Chevron Corporation, CUSA, Noble Energy, Inc. (Noble), and Texaco
Capital Inc. Most of these securities are the obligations of, or guaranteed by, Chevron Corporation and are rated AA- by Standard and Poor’s
Corporation and Aa2 by Moody’s Investors Service. The company’s U.S. commercial paper is rated A-1+ by Standard and Poor’s and P-1 by
Moody’s. All of these ratings denote high-quality, investment-grade securities.
The company’s future debt level is dependent primarily on results of operations, cash that may be generated from asset dispositions, the capital
program, lending commitments to affiliates and shareholder distributions. Based on its high-quality debt ratings, the company believes that it has
substantial borrowing capacity to meet unanticipated cash requirements. During extended periods of low prices for crude oil and natural gas and
narrow margins for refined products and commodity chemicals, the company has the ability to modify its capital spending plans and discontinue or
curtail the stock repurchase program. This provides the flexibility to continue paying the common stock dividend and remain committed to retaining
the company’s high-quality debt ratings.
Committed Credit Facilities Information related to committed credit facilities is included in Note 19 Short-Term Debt.
Summarized Financial Information for Guarantee of Securities of Subsidiaries CUSA issued bonds that are fully and unconditionally guaranteed

Common Stock Repurchase Program The Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program in 2019, with a maximum dollar limit of $25
billion and no set term limits (the “2019 Program”). During 2022, the company purchased 69.9 million shares for $11.25 billion under the 2019
Program. As of December 31, 2022, the company had purchased a total of 131.4 million shares for $18.1 billion, resulting in $6.9 billion remaining
under the 2019 Program. The company currently expects to repurchase $3.75 billion of its common stock during the first quarter of 2023 under the
2019 Program and will incur an additional one percent excise tax on such purchases as required by the IRA.
On January 25, 2023, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of the company’s shares of common stock in an aggregate amount of $75
billion. The $75 billion authorization takes effect on April 1, 2023 and does not have a fixed expiration date (the “2023 Program”). It replaces the
Board’s previous repurchase authorization of $25 billion from January 2019, which will terminate on March 31, 2023, after the completion of the
company’s repurchases in the first quarter of 2023.
Repurchases of shares of the company’s common stock may be made from time to time in the open market, by block purchases, in privately
negotiated transactions or in such other manner as determined by the company. The timing of the

repurchases and the actual amount repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including the market price of the company’s shares, general
market and economic conditions, and other factors. The stock repurchase program does not obligate the company to acquire any particular amount of
common stock and may be suspended or discontinued at any time.

Capex for 2022 was $12.0 billion, 49 percent higher than 2021 due to increased upstream spend in the Permian Basin along with higher spend in
downstream, largely related to the formation of the Bunge North America, Inc. (Bunge) joint venture and acquisition of the remaining interest in
Beyond6, LLC (Beyond6).
The company estimates that 2023 Capex will be approximately $14 billion. In the upstream business, Capex is estimated to be $11.5 billion and
includes more than $4 billion for Permian Basin development and roughly $2 billion for other shale & tight assets. More than 20 percent of upstream
Capex is planned for projects in the Gulf of Mexico. Worldwide downstream spending in 2023 is estimated to be $1.9 billion. Investments in
technology businesses and other corporate operations in 2023 are budgeted at $0.6 billion. Lower carbon Capex across all segments totals around $2
billion, including approximately $0.5 billion to lower the carbon intensity of Chevron’s traditional operations and about $1 billion to increase
renewable fuels production capacity.
Affiliate capital expenditures (Affiliate Capex), which does not require cash outlays by the company, is expected to be $3 billion in 2023. Nearly half
of Affiliate Capex is for Tengizchevroil’s FGP / WPMP Project in Kazakhstan and about a third is for CPChem.
Capital and Exploratory Expenditures Capital and exploratory expenditures (C&E) is a key performance indicator and provides the company’s
investment level in its consolidated companies. This metric includes additions to fixed asset or investment accounts along with exploration expense
for its consolidated companies. Management uses this metric along with Affiliate C&E (as defined below) to manage the allocation of capital across
the company’s entire portfolio, funding requirements and ultimately shareholder distributions.
The components of C&E are presented in the following table:

Affiliate Capital and Exploratory Expenditures Equity affiliate capital and exploratory expenditures (Affiliate C&E) is also a key performance
indicator that provides the company’s share of investments in its significant equity affiliate companies. This metric includes additions to fixed asset
and investment accounts along with exploration expense in the equity affiliate companies’ financial statements. Management uses this metric to
assess possible funding needs and/or shareholder distribution capacity of the company’s equity affiliate companies. Together with C&E, management
also uses Affiliate C&E to manage allocation of capital across the company’s entire portfolio, funding requirements and ultimately shareholder
distributions.

Financial Ratios and Metrics
The following represent several metrics the company believes are useful measures to monitor the financial health of the company and its performance
over time:
Current Ratio Current assets divided by current liabilities, which indicates the company’s ability to repay its short-term liabilities with short-term
assets. The current ratio in all periods was adversely affected by the fact that Chevron’s inventories are valued on a last-in, first-out basis. At year-end
2022, the book value of inventory was lower than replacement costs, based on average acquisition costs during the year, by approximately $9.1
billion.
                                                                                                                                          At December 31
Millions of dollars                                                                                      2022                 2021                 2020

Interest Coverage Ratio Income before income tax expense, plus interest and debt expense and amortization of capitalized interest, less net income
attributable to noncontrolling interests, divided by before-tax interest costs. This ratio indicates the company’s ability to pay interest on outstanding
debt. The company’s interest coverage ratio in 2022 was higher than 2021 due to higher income.

Financial and Derivative Instrument Market Risk
The market risk associated with the company’s portfolio of financial and derivative instruments is discussed below. The estimates of financial
exposure to market risk do not represent the company’s projection of future market changes. The actual impact of future market changes could differ
materially due to factors discussed elsewhere in this report, including those set forth under the heading “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A.

Derivative Commodity Instruments Chevron is exposed to market risks related to the price volatility of crude oil, refined products, natural gas
liquids, natural gas, liquefied natural gas and refinery feedstocks. The company uses derivative commodity instruments to manage these exposures on
a portion of its activity, including firm commitments and anticipated transactions for the purchase, sale and storage of crude oil, refined products,
natural gas liquids, natural gas, liquefied natural gas and feedstock for company refineries. The company also uses derivative commodity instruments
for limited trading purposes. The results of these activities were not material to the company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows
in 2022.
The company’s market exposure positions are monitored on a daily basis by an internal Risk Control group in accordance with the company’s risk
management policies. The company’s risk management practices and its compliance with policies are reviewed by the Audit Committee of the
company’s Board of Directors.
Derivatives beyond those designated as normal purchase and normal sale contracts are recorded at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheet with
resulting gains and losses reflected in income. Fair values are derived principally from published market quotes and other independent third-party
quotes. The change in fair value of Chevron’s derivative commodity instruments in 2022 was not material to the company’s results of operations.
The company uses the Monte Carlo simulation method as its Value-at-Risk (VaR) model to estimate the maximum potential loss in fair value, at the
95 percent confidence level with a one-day holding period, from the effect of adverse changes in market conditions on derivative commodity
instruments held or issued. Based on these inputs, the VaR for the company’s primary risk exposures in the area of derivative commodity instruments
at December 31, 2022 and 2021 was not material to the company’s cash flows or results of operations.
Foreign Currency The company may enter into foreign currency derivative contracts to manage some of its foreign currency exposures. These
exposures include revenue and anticipated purchase transactions, including foreign currency capital expenditures and lease commitments. The
foreign currency derivative contracts, if any, are recorded at fair value on the balance sheet with resulting gains and losses reflected in income. There
were no material open foreign currency derivative contracts at December 31, 2022.
Interest Rates The company may enter into interest rate swaps from time to time as part of its overall strategy to manage the interest rate risk on its
debt. Interest rate swaps, if any, are recorded at fair value on the balance sheet with resulting gains and losses reflected in income. At year-end 2022,
the company had no interest rate swaps.

Transactions With Related Parties
Chevron enters into a number of business arrangements with related parties, principally its equity affiliates. These arrangements include long-term
supply or offtake agreements and long-term purchase agreements. Refer to “Other Information” in Note 15 Investments and Advances for further
discussion. Management believes these agreements have been negotiated on terms consistent with those that would have been negotiated with an
unrelated party.

environmental issues. The liability balance of approximately $12.7 billion for asset retirement obligations at year-end 2022 is related primarily to
upstream properties.
For the company’s other ongoing operating assets, such as refineries and chemicals facilities, no provisions are made for exit or cleanup costs that
may be required when such assets reach the end of their useful lives unless a decision to sell or otherwise decommission the facility has been made,
as the indeterminate settlement dates for the asset retirements prevent estimation of the fair value of the asset retirement obligation.

Environmental Matters
The company is subject to various international and U.S. federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws, regulations and market-based
programs. These laws, regulations and programs continue to evolve and are expected to increase in both number and complexity over time and
govern not only the manner in which the company conducts its operations, but also the products it sells. Consideration of environmental issues and
the responses to those issues through international agreements and national, regional or state legislation or regulations are integrated into the
company’s strategy and planning, capital investment reviews and risk management tools and processes, where applicable. They are also factored into
the company’s long-range supply, demand and energy price forecasts. These forecasts reflect long-range effects from renewable fuel penetration,
energy efficiency standards, climate-related policy actions, and demand response to oil and natural gas prices. In addition, legislation and regulations
intended to address hydraulic fracturing also continue to evolve in many jurisdictions where we operate. Refer to “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A,
on pages 20 through 26 for a discussion of some of the inherent risks of increasingly restrictive environmental and other regulation that could
materially impact the company’s results of operations or financial condition. Refer to Business Environment and Outlook on pages 32 and 33 for a
discussion of legislative and regulatory efforts to address climate change.
Most of the costs of complying with existing laws and regulations pertaining to company operations and products are embedded in the normal costs
of doing business. However, it is not possible to predict with certainty the amount of additional investments in new or existing technology or facilities
or the amounts of increased operating costs to be incurred in the future to prevent, control, reduce or eliminate releases of hazardous materials or
other pollutants into the environment; remediate and restore areas damaged by prior releases of hazardous materials; or comply with new
environmental laws or regulations. Although these costs may be significant to the results of operations in any single period, the company does not
presently expect them to have a material adverse effect on the company’s liquidity or financial position.
Accidental leaks and spills requiring cleanup may occur in the ordinary course of business. The company may incur expenses for corrective actions at
various owned and previously owned facilities and at third-party-owned waste disposal sites used by the company. An obligation may arise when
operations are closed or sold or at non-Chevron sites where company products have been handled or disposed of. Most of the expenditures to fulfill
these obligations relate to facilities and sites where past operations followed practices and procedures that were considered acceptable at the time but
now require investigative or remedial work or both to meet current standards.
Using definitions and guidelines established by the American Petroleum Institute, Chevron estimated its worldwide environmental spending in 2022
at approximately $2.0 billion for its consolidated companies. Included in these expenditures were approximately $0.2 billion of environmental capital
expenditures and $1.8 billion of costs associated with the prevention, control, abatement or elimination of hazardous substances and pollutants from
operating, closed or divested sites, and the decommissioning and restoration of sites.

For 2023, total worldwide environmental capital expenditures are estimated at $0.2 billion. These capital costs are in addition to the ongoing costs of
complying with environmental regulations and the costs to remediate previously contaminated sites.

Critical Accounting Estimates and Assumptions
Management makes many estimates and assumptions in the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
(GAAP) that may have a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial statements and related disclosures and on the comparability of such
information over different reporting periods. Such estimates and assumptions affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, as
well as disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Estimates and assumptions are based on management’s experience and other information
available prior to the issuance of the financial statements. Materially different results can occur as circumstances change and additional information
becomes known.
The discussion in this section of “critical” accounting estimates and assumptions is according to the disclosure guidelines of the SEC, wherein:
        1. the nature of the estimates and assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly
             uncertain matters, or the susceptibility of such matters to change; and
        2. the impact of the estimates and assumptions on the company’s financial condition or operating performance is material.
The development and selection of accounting estimates and assumptions, including those deemed “critical,” and the associated disclosures in this
discussion have been discussed with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. The areas of accounting and the associated “critical” estimates
and assumptions made by the company are as follows:
Oil and Gas Reserves Crude oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas reserves are estimates of future production that impact certain asset and expense
accounts included in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Proved reserves are the estimated quantities of oil and gas that geoscience and
engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be economically producible in the future under existing economic conditions, operating
methods and government regulations. Proved reserves include both developed and undeveloped volumes. Proved developed reserves represent
volumes expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods. Proved undeveloped reserves are volumes
expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled proved acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for
recompletion. Variables impacting Chevron’s estimated volumes of crude oil and natural gas reserves include field performance, available
technology, commodity prices, and development, production and carbon costs.
The estimates of crude oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas reserves are important to the timing of expense recognition for costs incurred and to the
valuation of certain oil and gas producing assets. Impacts of oil and gas reserves on Chevron’s Consolidated Financial Statements, using the
successful efforts method of accounting, include the following:
          1.   Amortization - Capitalized exploratory drilling and development costs are depreciated on a unit-of-production (UOP) basis using
               proved developed reserves. Acquisition costs of proved properties are amortized on a UOP basis using total proved reserves. During
               2022, Chevron’s UOP Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization (DD&A) for oil and gas properties was $10.8 billion, and proved
               developed reserves at the beginning of 2022 were 6.6 billion barrels for consolidated companies. If the estimates of proved reserves
               used in the UOP calculations for consolidated operations had been lower by five percent across all oil and gas properties, UOP DD&A
               in 2022 would have increased by approximately $600 million.
          2.   Impairment - Oil and gas reserves are used in assessing oil and gas producing properties for impairment. A significant reduction in the
               estimated reserves of a property would trigger an impairment review. Proved reserves (and, in some cases, a portion of unproved
               resources) are used to estimate future production volumes in the cash flow model. For a further discussion of estimates and assumptions
               used in impairment assessments, see Impairment of Properties, Plant and Equipment and Investments in Affiliates below.
Refer to Table V, “Reserve Quantity Information,” for the changes in proved reserve estimates for each of the three years ended December 31, 2020,
2021 and 2022, and to Table VII, “Changes in the Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows From Proved Reserves” for estimates
of proved reserve values for each of the three years ended December 31, 2020, 2021 and 2022.

This Oil and Gas Reserves commentary should be read in conjunction with the Properties, Plant and Equipment section of Note 1 Summary of
Significant Accounting Policies, which includes a description of the “successful efforts” method of accounting for oil and gas exploration and
production activities.
Impairment of Properties, Plant and Equipment and Investments in Affiliates The company assesses its properties, plant and equipment (PP&E)
for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. If the
carrying value of an asset exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows expected from the asset, an impairment charge is recorded for the excess of the
carrying value of the asset over its estimated fair value.
Determination as to whether and how much an asset is impaired involves management estimates on highly uncertain matters, such as future
commodity prices, operating expenses, carbon costs, production profiles, the pace of the energy transition, and the outlook for global or regional
market supply-and-demand conditions for crude oil, natural gas liquids, natural gas, commodity chemicals and refined products. However, the
impairment reviews and calculations are based on assumptions that are generally consistent with the company’s business plans and long-term
investment decisions. Refer also to the discussion of impairments of properties, plant and equipment in Note 18 Properties, Plant and Equipment and
to the section on Properties, Plant and Equipment in Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.
The company performs impairment assessments when triggering events arise to determine whether any write-down in the carrying value of an asset
or asset group is required. For example, when significant downward revisions to crude oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas reserves are made for
any single field or concession, an impairment review is performed to determine if the carrying value of the asset remains recoverable. Similarly, a
significant downward revision in the company’s crude oil, natural gas liquids or natural gas price outlook would trigger impairment reviews for
impacted upstream assets. In addition, impairments could occur due to changes in national, state or local environmental regulations or laws, including
those designed to stop or impede the development or production of oil and gas. Also, if the expectation of sale of a particular asset or asset group in
any period has been deemed more likely than not, an impairment review is performed, and if the estimated net proceeds exceed the carrying value of
the asset or asset group, no impairment charge is required. Such calculations are reviewed each period until the asset or asset group is disposed.
Assets that are not impaired on a held-and-used basis could possibly become impaired if a decision is made to sell such assets. That is, the assets
would be impaired if they are classified as held-for-sale and the estimated proceeds from the sale, less costs to sell, are less than the assets’ associated
carrying values.
Investments in common stock of affiliates that are accounted for under the equity method, as well as investments in other securities of these equity
investees, are reviewed for impairment when the fair value of the investment falls below the company’s carrying value. When this occurs, a
determination must be made as to whether this loss is other-than-temporary, in which case the investment is impaired. Because of the number of
differing assumptions potentially affecting whether an investment is impaired in any period or the amount of the impairment, a sensitivity analysis is
not practicable.
A sensitivity analysis of the impact on earnings for these periods if other assumptions had been used in impairment reviews and impairment
calculations is not practicable, given the broad range of the company’s PP&E and the number of assumptions involved in the estimates. That is,
favorable changes to some assumptions might have avoided the need to impair any assets in these periods, whereas unfavorable changes might have
caused an additional unknown number of other assets to become impaired, or resulted in larger impacts on impaired assets.
Asset Retirement Obligations In the determination of fair value for an asset retirement obligation (ARO), the company uses various assumptions and
judgments, including such factors as the existence of a legal obligation, estimated amounts and timing of settlements, discount and inflation rates, and
the expected impact of advances in technology and process improvements. A sensitivity analysis of the ARO impact on earnings for 2022 is not
practicable, given the broad range of the company’s long-lived assets and the number of assumptions involved in the estimates. That is, favorable
changes to some assumptions would have reduced estimated future obligations, thereby lowering accretion expense and amortization costs, whereas
unfavorable changes would have the opposite effect. Refer to Note 25 Asset Retirement Obligations for additional discussions on asset retirement
obligations.
Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans Note 23 Employee Benefit Plans includes information on the funded status of the company’s
pension and other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheet; the components of pension and OPEB expense
reflected on the Consolidated Statement of Income; and the related underlying assumptions.

The determination of pension plan expense and obligations is based on a number of actuarial assumptions. Two critical assumptions are the expected
long-term rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate applied to pension plan obligations. Critical assumptions in determining expense and
obligations for OPEB plans, which provide for certain health care and life insurance benefits for qualifying retired employees and which are not
funded, are the discount rate and the assumed health care cost-trend rates. Information related to the company’s processes to develop these
assumptions is included in Note 23 Employee Benefit Plans under the relevant headings. Actual rates may vary significantly from estimates because
of unanticipated changes beyond the company’s control.
For 2022, the company used an expected long-term rate of return of 6.6 percent and a discount rate for service costs of 3.5 percent and a discount rate
for interest cost of 2.7 percent for the primary U.S. pension plan. The actual return for 2022 was (17.8) percent. For the 10 years ended December 31,
2022, actual asset returns averaged 5.7 percent for this plan. Additionally, with the exception of three years within this 10-year period, actual asset
returns for this plan equaled or exceeded 6.6 percent during each year.
Total pension expense for 2022 was $763 million. An increase in the expected long-term return on plan assets or the discount rate would reduce
pension plan expense, and vice versa. As an indication of the sensitivity of pension expense to the long-term rate of return assumption, a 1 percent
increase in this assumption for the company’s primary U.S. pension plan, which accounted for about 55 percent of companywide pension expense,
would have reduced total pension plan expense for 2022 by approximately $75 million. A 1 percent increase in the discount rates for this same plan
would have reduced pension expense for 2022 by approximately $177 million.
The aggregate funded status recognized at December 31, 2022, was a net liability of approximately $1.8 billion. An increase in the discount rate
would decrease the pension obligation, thus changing the funded status of a plan. At December 31, 2022, the company used a discount rate of 5.2
percent to measure the obligations for the primary U.S. pension plan. As an indication of the sensitivity of pension liabilities to the discount rate
assumption, a 0.25 percent increase in the discount rate applied to the company’s primary U.S. pension plan, which accounted for about 63 percent of
the companywide pension obligation, would have reduced the plan obligation by approximately $239 million, and would have decreased the plan’s
underfunded status from approximately $475 million to $236 million.
For the company’s OPEB plans, expense for 2022 was $89 million, and the total liability, all unfunded at the end of 2022, was $1.9 billion. For the
primary U.S. OPEB plan, the company used a discount rate for service cost of 3.1 percent and a discount rate for interest cost of 2.1 percent to
measure expense in 2022, and a 5.2 percent discount rate to measure the benefit obligations at December 31, 2022. Discount rate changes, similar to
those used in the pension sensitivity analysis, resulted in an immaterial impact on 2022 OPEB expense and OPEB liabilities at the end of 2022.
Differences between the various assumptions used to determine expense and the funded status of each plan and actual experience are included in
actuarial gain/loss. Refer to page 90 in Note 23 Employee Benefit Plans for more information on the $3.4 billion of before-tax actuarial losses
recorded by the company as of December 31, 2022. In addition, information related to company contributions is included on page 93 in Note 23
Employee Benefit Plans under the heading “Cash Contributions and Benefit Payments.”
Contingent Losses Management also makes judgments and estimates in recording liabilities for claims, litigation, tax matters and environmental
remediation. Actual costs can frequently vary from estimates for a variety of reasons. For example, the costs for settlement of claims and litigation
can vary from estimates based on differing interpretations of laws, opinions on culpability and assessments on the amount of damages. Similarly,
liabilities for environmental remediation are subject to change because of changes in laws, regulations and their interpretation, the determination of
additional information on the extent and nature of site contamination, and improvements in technology.
Under the accounting rules, a liability is generally recorded for these types of contingencies if management determines the loss to be both probable
and estimable. The company generally reports these losses as “Operating expenses” or “Selling, general and administrative expenses” on the
Consolidated Statement of Income. An exception to this handling is for income tax matters, for which benefits are recognized only if management
determines the tax position is more likely than not (i.e., likelihood greater than 50 percent) to be allowed by the tax jurisdiction. For additional
discussion of income tax uncertainties, refer to Note 24 Other Contingencies and Commitments under the heading “Income Taxes.” Refer also to the
business segment discussions elsewhere in this section for the effect on earnings from losses associated with certain litigation, environmental
remediation and tax matters for the three years ended December 31, 2022.
An estimate as to the sensitivity to earnings for these periods if other assumptions had been used in recording these liabilities is not practicable
because of the number of contingencies that must be assessed, the number of underlying


                                                                                54

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Chevron Corporation
Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Chevron Corporation and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31,
2022 and 2021, and the related consolidated statements of income, of comprehensive income, of equity and of cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended December 31, 2022, including the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under
Item 15(a)(2) (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the Company's internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the
Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2022 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the
Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria
established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.



Basis for Opinions
The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial
reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s
Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial
statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with
the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in
accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the
PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and
whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.

Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the
consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included
examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included
evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the
consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control
over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of
internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A
company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in
reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance
that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and
directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or
disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.




                                                                       58
                                                                                                                            Financial Table of Contents




Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any
evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was
communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the
consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical
audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating
the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.
The Impact of Proved Crude Oil and Natural Gas Reserves on Upstream Property, Plant, and Equipment, Net
As described in Notes 1 and 18 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s upstream property, plant and equipment, net balance was
$125.6 billion as of December 31, 2022, and depreciation, depletion and amortization expense was $14.8 billion for the year ended December 31,
2022. The Company follows the successful efforts method of accounting for crude oil and natural gas exploration and production activities.
Depreciation and depletion of all capitalized costs of proved crude oil and natural gas producing properties, except mineral interests, are
expensed using the unit-of-production method, generally by individual field, as the proved developed reserves are produced. Depletion expenses
for capitalized costs of proved mineral interests are recognized using the unit-of-production method by individual field as the related proved
reserves are produced. As disclosed by management, variables impacting the Company’s estimated volumes of crude oil and natural gas reserves
include field performance, available technology, commodity prices, and development, production and carbon costs. Reserves are estimated by
Company asset teams composed of earth scientists and engineers. As part of the internal control process related to reserves estimation, the
Company maintains a Reserves Advisory Committee (RAC) (the Company’s earth scientists, engineers and RAC are collectively referred to as
“management’s specialists”).

The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the impact of proved crude oil, natural gas liquids and
natural gas reserves on upstream property, plant, and equipment, net is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management,
including the use of management’s specialists, when developing the estimates of proved crude oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas reserve
volumes, which in turn led to (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit
evidence obtained related to the data, methods and assumptions used by management and its specialists in developing the estimates of proved
crude oil and natural gas reserve volumes.

Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the
consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management’s estimates of proved
crude oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas reserve volumes. The work of management’s specialists was used in performing the procedures to
evaluate the reasonableness of the proved crude oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas reserve volumes. As a basis for using this work, the
specialists’ qualifications were understood and the Company’s relationship with the specialists was assessed. The procedures performed also
included evaluation of the methods and assumptions used by the specialists, tests of the data used by the specialists and an evaluation of the
specialists’ findings.

Note 1
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
General The company’s Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America. These require the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses reported in the
financial statements, as well as amounts included in the notes thereto, including discussion and disclosure of contingent liabilities. Although the
company uses its best estimates and judgments, actual results could differ from these estimates as circumstances change and additional information
becomes known. Prior years’ data have been reclassified in certain cases to conform to the 2022 presentation basis.
Subsidiary and Affiliated Companies The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of controlled subsidiary companies more than
50 percent-owned and any variable interest entities in which the company is the primary beneficiary. Undivided interests in oil and gas joint ventures
and certain other assets are consolidated on a proportionate basis. Investments in and advances to affiliates in which the company has a substantial
ownership interest of approximately 20 percent to 50 percent, or for which the company exercises significant influence but not control over policy
decisions, are accounted for by the equity method.
Investments in affiliates are assessed for possible impairment when events indicate that the fair value of the investment may be below the company’s
carrying value. When such a condition is deemed to be other than temporary, the carrying value of the investment is written down to its fair value,
and the amount of the write-down is included in net income. In making the determination as to whether a decline is other than temporary, the
company considers such factors as the duration and extent of the decline, the investee’s financial performance, and the company’s ability and
intention to retain its investment for a period that will be sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in the investment’s market value. The new
cost basis of investments in these equity investees is not changed for subsequent recoveries in fair value.
Differences between the company’s carrying value of an equity investment and its underlying equity in the net assets of the affiliate are assigned to
the extent practicable to specific assets and liabilities based on the company’s analysis of the various factors giving rise to the difference. When
appropriate, the company’s share of the affiliate’s reported earnings is adjusted quarterly to reflect the difference between these allocated values and
the affiliate’s historical book values.
Noncontrolling Interests Ownership interests in the company’s subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent are presented separately from the
parent’s equity on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The amount of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and the noncontrolling interests
are both presented on the face of the Consolidated Statement of Income and Consolidated Statement of Equity. Included within noncontrolling
interest is redeemable noncontrolling interest.
Fair Value Measurements The three levels of the fair value hierarchy of inputs the company uses to measure the fair value of an asset or a liability
are as follows. Level 1 inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices
included within Level 1 that are directly or indirectly observable for the asset or liability. Level 3 inputs are inputs that are not observable in the
market.
Derivatives The majority of the company’s activity in derivative commodity instruments is intended to manage the financial risk posed by physical
transactions. For some of this derivative activity, the company may elect to apply fair value or cash flow hedge accounting with changes in fair value
recorded as components of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). For other similar derivative instruments, generally because of the short-
term nature of the contracts or their limited use, the company does not apply hedge accounting, and changes in the fair value of those contracts are
reflected in current income. For the company’s commodity trading activity, gains and losses from derivative instruments are reported in current
income. The company may enter into interest rate swaps from time to time as part of its overall strategy to manage the interest rate risk on its debt.
Interest rate swaps related to a portion of the company’s fixed-rate debt, if any, may be accounted for as fair value hedges. Interest rate swaps related
to floating-rate debt, if any, are recorded at fair value on the balance sheet with resulting gains and losses reflected in income. Where Chevron is a
party to master netting arrangements, fair value receivable and payable amounts recognized for derivative instruments executed with the same
counterparty are generally offset on the balance sheet.
Inventories Crude oil, products and chemicals inventories are generally stated at cost, using a last-in, first-out method. In the aggregate, these costs
are below market. “Materials, supplies and other” inventories are primarily stated at cost or net realizable value.

Properties, Plant and Equipment The successful efforts method is used for crude oil and natural gas exploration and production activities. All costs
for development wells, related plant and equipment, proved mineral interests in crude oil and natural gas properties, and related asset retirement
obligation (ARO) assets are capitalized. Costs of exploratory wells are capitalized pending determination of whether the wells found proved reserves.
Costs of wells that are assigned proved reserves remain capitalized. Costs also are capitalized for exploratory wells that have found crude oil and
natural gas reserves even if the reserves cannot be classified as proved when the drilling is completed, provided the exploratory well has found a
sufficient quantity of reserves to justify its completion as a producing well and the company is making sufficient progress assessing the reserves and
the economic and operating viability of the project. All other exploratory wells and costs are expensed. Refer to Note 21 Accounting for Suspended
Exploratory Wells for additional discussion of accounting for suspended exploratory well costs.
Long-lived assets to be held and used, including proved crude oil and natural gas properties, are assessed for possible impairment by comparing their
carrying values with their associated undiscounted, future net cash flows. Events that can trigger assessments for possible impairments include write-
downs of proved reserves based on field performance, significant decreases in the market value of an asset (including changes to the commodity price
forecast or carbon costs), significant change in the extent or manner of use of or a physical change in an asset, and a more likely than not expectation
that a long-lived asset or asset group will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly sooner than the end of its previously estimated useful life.
Impaired assets are written down to their estimated fair values, generally their discounted, future net cash flows. For proved crude oil and natural gas
properties, the company performs impairment reviews on a country, concession, PSC, development area or field basis, as appropriate. In downstream,
impairment reviews are performed on the basis of a refinery, a plant, a marketing/lubricants area or distribution area, as appropriate. Impairment
amounts are recorded as incremental “Depreciation, depletion and amortization” expense.
Long-lived assets that are held for sale are evaluated for possible impairment by comparing the carrying value of the asset with its fair value less the
cost to sell. If the net book value exceeds the fair value less cost to sell, the asset is considered impaired and adjusted to the lower value. Refer to
Note 9 Fair Value Measurements relating to fair value measurements. The fair value of a liability for an ARO is recorded as an asset and a liability
when there is a legal obligation associated with the retirement of a long-lived asset and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Refer also to Note
25 Asset Retirement Obligations relating to AROs.
Depreciation and depletion of all capitalized costs of proved crude oil and natural gas producing properties, except mineral interests, are expensed
using the unit-of-production method, generally by individual field, as the proved developed reserves are produced. Depletion expenses for capitalized
costs of proved mineral interests are recognized using the unit-of-production method by individual field as the related proved reserves are produced.
Impairments of capitalized costs of unproved mineral interests are expensed.
The capitalized costs of all other plant and equipment are depreciated or amortized over their estimated useful lives. In general, the declining-balance
method is used to depreciate plant and equipment in the United States; the straight-line method is generally used to depreciate international plant and
equipment and to amortize finance lease right-of-use assets.
Gains or losses are not recognized for normal retirements of properties, plant and equipment subject to composite group amortization or depreciation.
Gains or losses from abnormal retirements are recorded as expenses, and from sales as “Other income.”
Expenditures for maintenance (including those for planned major maintenance projects), repairs and minor renewals to maintain facilities in
operating condition are generally expensed as incurred. Major replacements and renewals are capitalized.
Leases Leases are classified as operating or finance leases. Both operating and finance leases recognize lease liabilities and associated right-of-use
assets. The company has elected the short-term lease exception and therefore only recognizes right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for leases with a
term greater than one year. The company has elected the practical expedient to not separate non-lease components from lease components for most
asset classes except for certain asset classes that have significant non-lease (i.e., service) components.
Where leases are used in joint ventures, the company recognizes 100 percent of the right-of-use assets and lease liabilities when the company is the
sole signatory for the lease (in most cases, where the company is the operator of a joint venture). Lease costs reflect only the costs associated with the
operator’s working interest share. The lease term includes the committed lease term identified in the contract, taking into account renewal and
termination options that management is

reasonably certain to exercise. The company uses its incremental borrowing rate as a proxy for the discount rate based on the term of the lease unless
the implicit rate is available.
Goodwill Goodwill resulting from a business combination is not subject to amortization. The company tests such goodwill at the reporting unit level
for impairment annually at December 31, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the
fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount.
Environmental Expenditures Environmental expenditures that relate to ongoing operations or to conditions caused by past operations are expensed.
Expenditures that create future benefits or contribute to future revenue generation are capitalized.
Liabilities related to future remediation costs are recorded when environmental assessments or cleanups or both are probable and the costs can be
reasonably estimated. For crude oil, natural gas and mineral-producing properties, a liability for an ARO is made in accordance with accounting
standards for asset retirement and environmental obligations. Refer to Note 25 Asset Retirement Obligations for a discussion of the company’s
AROs.
For U.S. federal Superfund sites and analogous sites under state laws, the company records a liability for its designated share of the probable and
estimable costs, and probable amounts for other potentially responsible parties when mandated by the regulatory agencies because the other parties
are not able to pay their respective shares. The gross amount of environmental liabilities is based on the company’s best estimate of future costs using
currently available technology and applying current regulations and the company’s own internal environmental policies. Future amounts are not
discounted. Recoveries or reimbursements are recorded as assets when receipt is reasonably assured.
Currency Translation The U.S. dollar is the functional currency for substantially all of the company’s consolidated operations and those of its equity
affiliates. For those operations, all gains and losses from currency remeasurement are included in current period income. The cumulative translation
effects for those few entities, both consolidated and affiliated, using functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar are included in “Currency
translation adjustment” on the Consolidated Statement of Equity.
Revenue Recognition The company accounts for each delivery order of crude oil, natural gas, petroleum and chemical products as a separate
performance obligation. Revenue is recognized when the performance obligation is satisfied, which typically occurs at the point in time when control
of the product transfers to the customer. Payment is generally due within 30 days of delivery. The company accounts for delivery transportation as a
fulfillment cost, not a separate performance obligation, and recognizes these costs as an operating expense in the period when revenue for the related
commodity is recognized.
Revenue is measured as the amount the company expects to receive in exchange for transferring commodities to the customer. The company’s
commodity sales are typically based on prevailing market-based prices and may include discounts and allowances. Until market prices become
known under terms of the company’s contracts, the transaction price included in revenue is based on the company’s estimate of the most likely
outcome.
Discounts and allowances are estimated using a combination of historical and recent data trends. When deliveries contain multiple products, an
observable standalone selling price is generally used to measure revenue for each product. The company includes estimates in the transaction price
only to the extent that a significant reversal of revenue is not probable in subsequent periods.
Stock Options and Other Share-Based Compensation The company issues stock options and other share-based compensation to certain employees.
For equity awards, such as stock options, total compensation cost is based on the grant date fair value, and for liability awards, such as stock
appreciation rights, total compensation cost is based on the settlement value. The company recognizes stock-based compensation expense for all
awards over the service period required to earn the award, which is the shorter of the vesting period or the time period in which an employee becomes
eligible to retain the award at retirement. The company’s Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) awards include stock options and stock appreciation
rights, which have graded vesting provisions by which one-third of each award vests on each of the first, second and third anniversaries of the date of
grant. In addition, performance shares granted under the company’s LTIP will vest at the end of the three-year performance period. For awards
granted under the company’s LTIP beginning in 2017, stock options and stock appreciation rights have graded vesting by which one third of each
award vests annually on each January 31 on or after the first anniversary of the grant date. Special restricted stock unit awards have cliff vesting by
which the total award will vest on January 31 on or after the third anniversary of the grant date. Standard restricted stock unit awards have cliff
vesting by which the total award will vest on January 31 on or after the fifth anniversary of the grant date, subject to adjustment upon termination
pursuant to the satisfaction of certain criteria. Commencing for grants issued in January 2023

Fair Value Measurements
The tables below show the fair value hierarchy for assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring and nonrecurring basis at December 31,
2022 and 2021.
Marketable Securities The company calculates fair value for its marketable securities based on quoted market prices for identical assets. The fair
values reflect the cash that would have been received if the instruments were sold at December 31, 2022.
Derivatives The company records most of its derivative instruments – other than any commodity derivative contracts that are accounted for as normal
purchase and normal sale – on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at fair value, with the offsetting

amount to the Consolidated Statement of Income. The company designates certain derivative instruments as cash flow hedges that, if applicable, are
reflected in the table below. Derivatives classified as Level 1 include futures, swaps and options contracts valued using quoted prices from active
markets such as the New York Mercantile Exchange. Derivatives classified as Level 2 include swaps, options and forward contracts, the fair values of
which are obtained from third-party broker quotes, industry pricing services and exchanges. The company obtains multiple sources of pricing
information for the Level 2 instruments. Since this pricing information is generated from observable market data, it has historically been very
consistent. The company does not materially adjust this information.
Properties, Plant and Equipment The company did not have any individually material impairments of long-lived assets measured at fair value on a
nonrecurring basis to report in 2022 or 2021.
Investments and Advances The company did not have any material impairments of investments and advances measured at fair value on a
nonrecurring basis to report in 2022 or 2021.

At year-end 2022, the company had assets measured at fair value Level 3 using unobservable inputs of $85. The carrying value of these assets were
written down to fair value based on estimates derived from internal discounted cash flow models. Cash flows were determined using estimates of
future production, an outlook of future price based on published prices and a discount rate believed to be consistent with those used by principal
market participants.
Assets and Liabilities Not Required to Be Measured at Fair Value The company holds cash equivalents in U.S. and non-U.S. portfolios. The
instruments classified as cash equivalents are primarily bank time deposits with maturities of 90 days or less and money market funds. “Cash and
cash equivalents” had carrying/fair values of $17,678 and $5,640 at December 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021, respectively. The fair values of
cash and cash equivalents are classified as Level 1 and reflect the cash that would have been received if the instruments were settled at December 31,
2022.
“Cash and cash equivalents” do not include investments with a carrying/fair value of $1,443 and $1,155 at December 31, 2022, and December 31,
2021, respectively. At December 31, 2022, these investments are classified as Level 1 and include restricted funds related to certain upstream
decommissioning activities, tax payments and a financing program.
Long-term debt, excluding finance lease liabilities, of $16,258 and $22,164 at December 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021, respectively, had
estimated fair values of $14,959 and $23,670, respectively. Long-term debt primarily includes corporate issued bonds. The fair value of corporate
bonds is $14,571 and classified as Level 1. The fair value of other long-term debt classified as Level 2 is $388.
The carrying values of other short-term financial assets and liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet approximate their fair values. Fair value
remeasurements of other financial instruments at December 31, 2022 and 2021, were not material.

Financial and Derivative Instruments
Derivative Commodity Instruments The company’s derivative commodity instruments principally include crude oil, natural gas, liquefied natural gas
and refined product futures, swaps, options, and forward contracts. The company applies cash flow hedge accounting to certain commodity
transactions, where appropriate, to manage the market price risk associated with forecasted sales of crude oil. The company’s derivatives are not
material to the company’s financial position, results of operations or liquidity. The company believes it has no material market or credit risks to its
operations, financial position or liquidity as a result of its commodity derivative activities.
The company uses derivative commodity instruments traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange and on electronic platforms of the Inter-
Continental Exchange and Chicago Mercantile Exchange. In addition, the company enters into swap contracts and option contracts principally with
major financial institutions and other oil and gas companies in the “over-the-counter” markets, which are governed by International Swaps and
Derivatives Association agreements and other master netting arrangements. Depending on the nature of the derivative transactions, bilateral collateral
arrangements may also be required.

The amount reclassified from “Accumulated other comprehensive losses” (AOCL) to “Sales and other operating revenues” from designated hedges
was $80 in 2022, compared with an immaterial amount in the prior year. At December 31, 2022, before-tax deferred losses in AOCL related to
outstanding crude oil price hedging contracts were $15, all of which is expected to be reclassified into earnings during the next 12 months as the
hedged crude oil sales are recognized in earnings.

Derivative assets and liabilities are classified on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as “Accounts and notes receivable”, “Long-term receivables”,
“Accounts payable”, and “Deferred credits and other noncurrent obligations”. Amounts not offset on the Consolidated Balance Sheet represent
positions that do not meet all the conditions for “a right of offset.”
Concentrations of Credit Risk The company’s financial instruments that are exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of its cash
equivalents, marketable securities, derivative financial instruments and trade receivables. The company’s short-term investments are placed with a
wide array of financial institutions with high credit ratings. Company investment policies limit the company’s exposure both to credit risk and to
concentrations of credit risk. Similar policies on diversification and creditworthiness are applied to the company’s counterparties in derivative
instruments. For a discussion of credit risk on trade receivables, see Note 28 Financial Instruments - Credit Losses.

Assets Held for Sale
At December 31, 2022, the company classified $436 of net properties, plant and equipment as “Assets held for sale” on the Consolidated Balance
Sheet. These assets are associated with upstream operations that are anticipated to be sold in the next 12 months. The revenues and earnings
contributions of these assets in 2022 were not material.

Note 12
Equity
Retained earnings at December 31, 2022 and 2021, included $33,570 and $28,876, respectively, for the company’s share of undistributed earnings of
equity affiliates.
At December 31, 2022, about 104 million shares of Chevron’s common stock remained available for issuance from the 104 million shares that were
reserved for issuance under the 2022 Chevron Long-Term Incentive Plan. In addition, 597,152 shares remain available for issuance from the
1,600,000 shares of the company’s common stock that were reserved for awards under the Chevron Corporation Non-Employee Directors’ Equity
Compensation and Deferral Plan.

Note 13
Earnings Per Share
Basic earnings per share (EPS) is based upon “Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Chevron Corporation” (“earnings”) and includes the effects of
deferrals of salary and other compensation awards that are invested in Chevron stock units by certain officers and employees of the company. Diluted
EPS includes the effects of these items as well as the dilutive effects of outstanding stock options awarded under the company’s stock option
programs (refer to Note 22 Stock Options and Other Share-Based Compensation). The table below sets forth the computation of basic and diluted
EPS:

Operating Segments and Geographic Data
Although each subsidiary of Chevron is responsible for its own affairs, Chevron Corporation manages its investments in these subsidiaries and their
affiliates. The investments are grouped into two business segments, Upstream and Downstream, representing the company’s “reportable segments”
and “operating segments.” Upstream operations consist primarily of exploring for, developing, producing and transporting crude oil and natural gas;
liquefaction, transportation and regasification associated with liquefied natural gas (LNG); transporting crude oil by major international oil export
pipelines; processing, transporting, storage and marketing of natural gas; and a gas-to-liquids plant. Downstream operations consist primarily of
refining of crude oil into petroleum products; marketing of crude oil, refined products, and lubricants; manufacturing and marketing of renewable
fuels; transporting of crude oil and refined products by pipeline, marine vessel, motor equipment and rail car; and manufacturing and marketing of
commodity petrochemicals, plastics for industrial uses, and fuel and lubricant additives. All Other activities of the company include worldwide cash
management and debt financing activities, corporate administrative functions, insurance operations, real estate activities, and technology activities.
The company’s segments are managed by “segment managers” who report to the “chief operating decision maker” (CODM). The segments represent
components of the company that engage in activities (a) from which revenues are earned and expenses are incurred; (b) whose operating results are
regularly reviewed by the CODM, which makes decisions about resources to be allocated to the segments and assesses their performance; and (c) for
which discrete financial information is available.
The company’s primary country of operation is the United States of America, its country of domicile. Other components of the company’s operations
are reported as “International” (outside the United States).
Segment Earnings The company evaluates the performance of its operating segments on an after-tax basis, without considering the effects of debt
financing interest expense or investment interest income, both of which are managed by the company on a worldwide basis. Corporate administrative
costs are not allocated to the operating segments. However, operating segments are billed for the direct use of corporate services. Non-billable costs
remain at the corporate level in “All Other.” Earnings by major operating area are presented in the following table:

Segment Sales and Other Operating Revenues Operating segment sales and other operating revenues, including internal transfers, for the years
2022, 2021 and 2020, are presented in the table on the next page. Products are transferred between operating segments at internal product values that
approximate market prices.
Revenues for the upstream segment are derived primarily from the production and sale of crude oil and natural gas, as well as the sale of third-party
production of natural gas. Revenues for the downstream segment are derived from the refining and marketing of petroleum products such as gasoline,
jet fuel, gas oils, lubricants, residual fuel oils and other products derived from crude oil. This segment also generates revenues from the manufacture
and sale of fuel and lubricant additives and the transportation and trading of refined products and crude oil. “All Other” activities include revenues
from insurance operations, real estate activities and technology companies.

Descriptions of major equity affiliates and non-equity investments, including significant differences between the company’s carrying value of its
investments and its underlying equity in the net assets of the affiliates, are as follows:
Tengizchevroil Chevron has a 50 percent equity ownership interest in Tengizchevroil (TCO), which operates the Tengiz and Korolev crude oil fields
in Kazakhstan. At December 31, 2022, the company’s carrying value of its investment in TCO was about $90 higher than the amount of underlying
equity in TCO’s net assets. This difference results from Chevron acquiring a portion of its interest in TCO at a value greater than the underlying book
value for that portion of TCO’s net assets. Included in the investment is a loan to TCO to fund the development of the FGP/WPMP with a principal
balance of $4,500.
Petropiar Chevron has a 30 percent interest in Petropiar, a joint stock company which operates the heavy oil Huyapari Field and upgrading project in
Venezuela’s Orinoco Belt. In 2020, the company fully impaired its investments in the Petropiar affiliate and, effective July 1, 2020, began accounting
for this venture as a non-equity method investment.
Petroboscan Chevron has a 39.2 percent interest in Petroboscan, a joint stock company which operates the Boscan Field in Venezuela. In 2020, the
company fully impaired its investments in the Petroboscan affiliate and, effective July 1, 2020, began accounting for this venture as a non-equity
method investment. The company also has an outstanding long-term loan to Petroboscan of $560, which remains fully provisioned for at year-end
2022.

Litigation
Ecuador
In 2003, Chevron was sued in Ecuador for environmental harm allegedly caused by an oil consortium formerly operated by a Texaco subsidiary. The
subsidiary previously had been released from environmental claims by Ecuador after it completed a three-year remediation program, which Ecuador
certified. Nonetheless, in February 2011, the Ecuadorian trial court entered judgment against Chevron for approximately $9.5 billion, plus punitive
damages. An appellate panel affirmed, and Ecuador’s National Court of Justice ratified the judgment but nullified the punitive damages. Ecuador’s
highest Constitutional Court rejected Chevron’s final appeal in July 2018.
In 2011, Chevron sued the Ecuadorian plaintiffs and several of their lawyers and cohorts in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New
York (SDNY) for violations of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act and state law. The SDNY ruled that the Ecuadorian
judgment had been procured through fraud, bribery, and corruption, and prohibited the defendants from seeking to enforce the judgment in the United
States or profiting from their illegal acts. The Second Circuit affirmed, and the U.S. Supreme Court denied certiorari in 2017. The Ecuadorian
plaintiffs sought to have the Ecuadorian judgment recognized and enforced in Canada, Brazil, and Argentina, but all of those actions were dismissed
in Chevron’s favor.
In 2009, Chevron filed an arbitration claim against Ecuador before an arbitral tribunal administered by the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The
Hague, under the United States-Ecuador Bilateral Investment Treaty. In 2018, the Tribunal ruled that the Ecuadorian judgment was procured through
fraud, bribery, and corruption, and was based on environmental claims that Ecuador had already settled and released. According to the Tribunal, the
Ecuadorian judgment “violates international public policy” and “should not be recognized or enforced by the courts of other States.” The Tribunal
ordered Ecuador to remove the judgment’s status of enforceability and to compensate Chevron for its injuries. The arbitration’s final phases, to
determine the amount of compensation owed to Chevron and to allocate the arbitration’s costs, remain pending. In 2020, the District Court of The
Hague denied Ecuador’s request to set aside the Tribunal’s award. Based on Ecuador’s admissions during the litigation, the Court stated that it now is
“common ground” between Ecuador and Chevron that the Ecuadorian judgment is fraudulent. In June 2022, The Hague Court of Appeals dismissed
Ecuador’s appeal. In September

2022, Ecuador appealed to the Dutch Supreme Court. In a separate proceeding before the Office of the United States Trade Representative, Ecuador
also admitted in July 2020 that the Ecuadorian judgment is fraudulent.
Management continues to believe that the Ecuadorian judgment is illegitimate and unenforceable and will vigorously defend against any further
attempts to have it recognized or enforced.
Climate Change
Governmental and other entities in various jurisdictions across the United States have filed legal proceedings against fossil fuel producing companies,
including Chevron entities, purporting to seek legal and equitable relief to address alleged impacts of climate change. Chevron entities are or were
among the codefendants in 23 separate lawsuits brought by 17 U.S. cities and counties, three U.S. states, the District of Columbia, a group of
municipalities in Puerto Rico and a trade group. One of the city lawsuits was dismissed on the merits, and one of the county lawsuits was voluntarily
dismissed by the plaintiff. The lawsuits assert various causes of action, including public nuisance, private nuisance, failure to warn, fraud, conspiracy
to commit fraud, design defect, product defect, trespass, negligence, impairment of public trust, violations of consumer protection statutes, violations
of a federal antitrust statute, and violations of the RICO Act, based upon, among other things, the company’s production of oil and gas products and
alleged misrepresentations or omissions relating to climate change risks associated with those products. The unprecedented legal theories set forth in
these proceedings entail the possibility of damages liability (both compensatory and punitive), injunctive and other forms of equitable relief,
including without limitation abatement and disgorgement of profits, civil penalties and liability for fees and costs of suits, that, while we believe
remote, could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations and financial condition. Further such proceedings are likely to be
filed by other parties. Management believes that these proceedings are legally and factually meritless and detract from constructive efforts to address
the important policy issues presented by climate change, and will vigorously defend against such proceedings.
Louisiana
Seven coastal parishes and the State of Louisiana have filed lawsuits in Louisiana against numerous oil and gas companies seeking damages for
coastal erosion in or near oil fields located within Louisiana’s coastal zone under Louisiana’s State and Local Coastal Resources Management Act
(SLCRMA). Chevron entities are defendants in 39 of these cases. The lawsuits allege that the defendants’ historical operations were conducted
without necessary permits or failed to comply with permits obtained and seek damages and other relief, including the costs of restoring coastal
wetlands allegedly impacted by oil field operations. Plaintiffs’ SLCRMA theories are unprecedented; thus, there remains significant uncertainty
about the scope of the claims and alleged damages and any potential effects on the company’s results of operations and financial condition.
Management believes that the claims lack legal and factual merit and will continue to vigorously defend against such proceedings.

   The company’s effective tax rate is reflective of equity income reported on an after-tax basis as part of the “Total Income (Loss) Before Income Tax Expense,” in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted
   Accounting Principles. Chevron’s share of its equity affiliates’ total income tax expense in 2022 was $2,281.

The 2022 increase in income tax expense of $8,116 is a result of the year-over-year increase in total income before income tax expense, which is
primarily due to higher upstream realizations and downstream margins. The company’s effective tax rate changed from 27.5 percent in 2021 to 28.3
percent in 2022. The change in effective tax rate is mainly due to mix effects resulting from the absolute level of earnings or losses and whether they
arose in higher or lower tax rate jurisdictions.
The company records its deferred taxes on a tax-jurisdiction basis. The reported deferred tax balances are composed of the following:

Deferred tax liabilities increased by $1,513 from year-end 2021, primarily driven by an increase to properties, plant and equipment. Deferred tax
assets decreased by $226 from year-end 2021. This decrease was primarily related to decreases in employee benefits and tax loss carryforwards for
various locations, partially offset by the increase in foreign tax credits.
The overall valuation allowance relates to deferred tax assets for U.S. foreign tax credit carryforwards, tax loss carryforwards and temporary
differences. The valuation allowance reduces the deferred tax assets to amounts that are, in management’s assessment, more likely than not to be
realized. At the end of 2022, the company had gross tax loss carryforwards of approximately $9,850 and tax credit carryforwards of approximately
$440, primarily related to various international tax jurisdictions. Whereas some of these tax loss carryforwards do not have an expiration date, others
expire at various times from 2023 through 2041. U.S. foreign tax credit carryforwards of $12,599 will expire between 2023 and 2033.

Income taxes, including U.S. state and foreign withholding taxes, are not accrued for unremitted earnings of international operations that have been
or are intended to be reinvested indefinitely. The indefinite reinvestment assertion continues to apply for the purpose of determining deferred tax
liabilities for U.S. state and foreign withholding tax purposes.
Undistributed earnings of international consolidated subsidiaries and affiliates for which no deferred income tax provision has been made for possible
future remittances totaled approximately $51,300 at December 31, 2022. This amount represents earnings reinvested as part of the company’s
ongoing international business. It is not practicable to estimate the amount of state and foreign withholding taxes that might be payable on the
possible remittance of earnings that are intended to be reinvested indefinitely. The company does not anticipate incurring significant additional taxes
on remittances of earnings that are not indefinitely reinvested.
Uncertain Income Tax Positions The company recognizes a tax benefit in the financial statements for an uncertain tax position only if management’s
assessment is that the position is more likely than not (i.e., a likelihood greater than 50 percent) to be allowed by the tax jurisdiction based solely on
the technical merits of the position. The term “tax position” in the accounting standards for income taxes refers to a position in a previously filed tax
return or a position expected to be taken in a future tax return that is reflected in measuring current or deferred income tax assets and liabilities for
interim or annual periods.
The following table indicates the changes to the company’s unrecognized tax benefits for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020. The
term “unrecognized tax benefits” in the accounting standards for income taxes refers to the differences between a tax position taken or expected to be
taken in a tax return and the benefit measured and recognized in the financial statements. Interest and penalties are not included.

Approximately 80 percent of the $5,323 of unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2022, would have an impact on the effective tax rate if
subsequently recognized. Certain of these unrecognized tax benefits relate to tax carryforwards that may require a full valuation allowance at the time
of any such recognition.
Tax positions for Chevron and its subsidiaries and affiliates are subject to income tax audits by many tax jurisdictions throughout the world. For the
company’s major tax jurisdictions, examinations of tax returns for certain prior tax years had not been completed as of December 31, 2022. For these
jurisdictions, the latest years for which income tax examinations had been finalized were as follows: United States – 2016, Nigeria – 2007, Australia
– 2009, Kazakhstan – 2012 and Saudi Arabia – 2016.
The company engages in ongoing discussions with tax authorities regarding the resolution of tax matters in the various jurisdictions. Both the
outcome of these tax matters and the timing of resolution and/or closure of the tax audits are highly uncertain. Of the amount of unrecognized tax
benefits the company has identified as of December 31, 2022, it is reasonably possible that developments on tax matters in certain tax jurisdictions
may result in decreases of approximately 20 percent within the next 12 months. Given the number of years that still remain subject to examination
and the number of matters being examined in the various tax jurisdictions, the company is unable to estimate the range of possible adjustments to the
balance of unrecognized tax benefits beyond the next 12 months.
On the Consolidated Statement of Income, the company reports interest and penalties related to liabilities for uncertain tax positions as “Income Tax
Expense (Benefit).” As of December 31, 2022, accrued expense of $112 for anticipated interest

Redeemable long-term obligations consist primarily of tax-exempt variable-rate put bonds that are included as current liabilities because they become
redeemable at the option of the bondholders during the year following the balance sheet date.
The company may periodically enter into interest rate swaps on a portion of its short-term debt. At December 31, 2022, the company had no interest
rate swaps on short-term debt.
At December 31, 2022, the company had $8,495 in 364-day committed credit facilities with various major banks that enable the refinancing of short-
term obligations on a long-term basis. The credit facilities allow the company to convert any amounts outstanding into a term loan for a period of up
to one year. This supports commercial paper borrowing and can also be used for general corporate purposes. The company’s practice has been to
continually replace expiring commitments with new commitments on substantially the same terms, maintaining levels management believes
appropriate. Any borrowings under the facility would be unsecured indebtedness at interest rates based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate
(SOFR), or an average of base lending rates published by specified banks and on terms reflecting the company’s strong credit rating. No borrowings
were outstanding under this facility at December 31, 2022.
The company classified $4,050 and $7,759 of short-term debt as long-term at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Settlement of these
obligations is not expected to require the use of working capital within one year, and the company has both the intent and the ability, as evidenced by
committed credit facilities, to refinance them on a long-term basis.

Note 21
Accounting for Suspended Exploratory Wells
The company continues to capitalize exploratory well costs after the completion of drilling when the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves
to justify completion as a producing well, and the business unit is making sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating
viability of the project. If either condition is not met or if the company obtains information that raises substantial doubt about the economic or
operational viability of the project, the exploratory well would be assumed to be impaired, and its costs, net of any salvage value, would be charged
to expense.

*
 Certain projects have multiple wells or fields or both.

Of the $1,554 of exploratory well costs capitalized for more than one year at December 31, 2022, $945 is related to seven projects that had drilling
activities underway or firmly planned for the near future. The $609 balance is related to five projects in areas requiring a major capital expenditure
before production could begin and for which additional drilling efforts were not underway or firmly planned for the near future. Additional drilling
was not deemed necessary because the presence of hydrocarbons had already been established, and other activities were in process to enable a future
decision on project development.
The projects for the $609 referenced above had the following activities associated with assessing the reserves and the projects’ economic viability: (a)
$194 (three projects) – undergoing front-end engineering and design with final investment decision expected within four years; (b) $415 (two
projects) – development alternatives under review. While progress was being made on all 12 projects, the decision on the recognition of proved
reserves under SEC rules in some cases may not occur for several years because of the complexity, scale and negotiations associated with the
projects. More than three-quarters of these decisions are expected to occur in the next five years.
The $1,554 of suspended well costs capitalized for a period greater than one year as of December 31, 2022, represents 71 exploratory wells in 12
projects. The tables below contain the aging of these costs on a well and project basis:

Cash received in payment for option exercises under all share-based payment arrangements for 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $5,835, $1,274 and $226,
respectively. Actual tax benefits realized for the tax deductions from option exercises were $216, $(15) and $8 for 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
Cash paid to settle performance shares, restricted stock units and stock appreciation rights was $556, $163 and $95 for 2022, 2021 and 2020,
respectively.
On May 25, 2022, stockholders approved the Chevron 2022 Long-Term Incentive Plan (2022 LTIP). Awards under the 2022 LTIP may take the form
of, but are not limited to, stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, stock appreciation rights, performance shares and non-stock grants.
From May 2022 through May 2032, no more than 104 million shares may be issued under the 2022 LTIP. For awards issued on or after May 25,
2022, no more than 48 million of those shares may be issued in the form of full value awards such as share-settled restricted stock, share-settled
restricted stock units and other share-settled awards that do not require full payment in cash or property for shares underlying such awards by the
award recipient. For the major types of awards issued before January 1, 2017, the contractual terms vary between three years for the performance
shares and restricted stock units, and 10 years for the stock options and stock appreciation rights. For awards issued after January 1, 2017, contractual
terms vary between three years for the performance shares and special restricted stock units, five years for standard restricted stock units and 10 years
for the stock options and stock appreciation rights. Commencing for grants issued in January 2023 and after, standard restricted stock units vest
ratably on an annual basis over a three-year period. Forfeitures of performance shares, restricted stock units, and stock appreciation rights are
recognized as they occur. Forfeitures of stock options are estimated using historical forfeiture data dating back to 1990.
Noble Share-Based Plans (Noble Plans) When Chevron acquired Noble in October 2020, outstanding stock options granted under various Noble
Plans were exchanged for Chevron options. These awards retained the same provisions as the original Noble Plans. Awards issued may be exercised
for up to five years after termination of employment, depending upon the termination type, or the original expiration date, whichever is earlier. Other
awards issued under the Noble Plans included restricted stock awards, restricted stock units, and performance shares, which retained the same
provisions as the original Noble Plans. Upon termination of employment due to change-in-control, all unvested awards issued under the Noble Plans,
including stock options, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units and performance shares vested on the termination date. If not exercised, awards
will expire between 2023 and 2029.
Fair Value and Assumptions The fair market values of stock options and stock appreciation rights granted in 2022, 2021 and 2020 were measured on
the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions:

Note 23
Employee Benefit Plans
The company has defined benefit pension plans for many employees. The company typically prefunds defined benefit plans as required by local
regulations or in certain situations where prefunding provides economic advantages. In the United States, all qualified plans are subject to the
Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) minimum funding standard. The company does not typically fund U.S. nonqualified pension
plans that are not subject to funding requirements under laws and regulations because contributions to these pension plans may be less economic and
investment returns may be less attractive than the company’s other investment alternatives.
The company also sponsors other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans that provide medical and dental benefits, as well as life insurance for some
active and qualifying retired employees. The plans are unfunded, and the company and retirees share the costs. For the company’s main U.S. medical
plan, the increase to the pre-Medicare company contribution for retiree medical coverage is limited to no more than 4 percent each year. Certain life
insurance benefits are paid by the company.
The company recognizes the overfunded or underfunded status of each of its defined benefit pension and OPEB plans as an asset or liability on the
Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Expected Return on Plan Assets The company’s estimated long-term rates of return on pension assets are driven primarily by actual historical asset-
class returns, an assessment of expected future performance, advice from external actuarial firms and the incorporation of specific asset-class risk
factors. Asset allocations are periodically updated using pension plan asset/liability studies, and the company’s estimated long-term rates of return are
consistent with these studies. For 2022, the company used an expected long-term rate of return of 6.6 percent for U.S. pension plan assets, which
account for 67 percent of the company’s pension plan assets.
The market-related value of assets of the main U.S. pension plan used in the determination of pension expense was based on the market values in the
three months preceding the year-end measurement date. Management considers the three-month time period long enough to minimize the effects of
distortions from day-to-day market volatility and still be contemporaneous to the end of the year. For other plans, market value of assets as of year-
end is used in calculating the pension expense.

Discount Rate The discount rate assumptions used to determine the U.S. and international pension and OPEB plan obligations and expense reflect
the rate at which benefits could be effectively settled, and are equal to the equivalent single rate resulting from yield curve analysis. This analysis
considered the projected benefit payments specific to the company’s plans and the yields on high-quality bonds. The projected cash flows were
discounted to the valuation date using the yield curve for the main U.S. pension and OPEB plans. The effective discount rates derived from this
analysis were 5.2 percent, 2.8 percent, and 2.4 percent for 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively, for both the main U.S. pension and OPEB plans.
Other Benefit Assumptions For the measurement of accumulated postretirement benefit obligation at December 31, 2022, for the main U.S. OPEB
plan, the assumed health care cost-trend rates start with 6.6 percent in 2023 and gradually decline to 4.5 percent for 2032 and beyond. For this
measurement at December 31, 2021, the assumed health care cost-trend rates started with 6.2 percent in 2022 and gradually declined to 4.5 percent
for 2031 and beyond.

The primary investment objectives of the pension plans are to achieve the highest rate of total return within prudent levels of risk and liquidity, to
diversify and mitigate potential downside risk associated with the investments, and to provide adequate liquidity for benefit payments and portfolio
management.
The company’s U.S. and U.K. pension plans comprise 94 percent of the total pension assets. Both the U.S. and U.K. plans have an Investment
Committee that regularly meets during the year to review the asset holdings and their returns. To assess the plans’ investment performance, long-term
asset allocation policy benchmarks have been established.
For the primary U.S. pension plan, the company’s Investment Committee has established the following approved asset allocation ranges: Equities
35–65 percent, Fixed Income 25–45 percent, Real Estate 5–25 percent, Alternative Investments 0–5 percent and Cash 0–15 percent. For the U.K.
pension plan, the U.K. Board of Trustees has established the following asset allocation guidelines: Equities 5–15 percent, Fixed Income 35–45
percent, Real Estate 5–15 percent, and Cash 0–5 percent. The other significant international pension plans also have established maximum and
minimum asset allocation ranges that vary by plan. Actual asset allocation within approved ranges is based on a variety of factors, including market
conditions and illiquidity constraints. To mitigate concentration and other risks, assets are invested across multiple asset classes with active
investment managers and passive index funds.
The company does not prefund its OPEB obligations.
Cash Contributions and Benefit Payments In 2022, the company contributed $1,164 and $158 to its U.S. and international pension plans,
respectively. In 2023, the company expects contributions to be approximately $1,000 to its U.S. plans and $100 to its international pension plans.
Actual contribution amounts are dependent upon investment returns, changes in pension obligations, regulatory environments, tax law changes and
other economic factors. Additional funding may ultimately be required if investment returns are insufficient to offset increases in plan obligations.
The company anticipates paying OPEB benefits of approximately $150 in 2023; $158 was paid in 2022.
The following benefit payments, which include estimated future service, are expected to be paid by the company in the next 10 years:
                                                                                                                            Pension Benefits                   Other

Benefit Plan Trusts Prior to its acquisition by Chevron, Texaco established a benefit plan trust for funding obligations under some of its benefit
plans. At year-end 2022, the trust contained 14.2 million shares of Chevron treasury stock. The trust will sell the shares or use the dividends from the
shares to pay benefits only to the extent that the company does not pay such benefits. The company intends to continue to pay its obligations under
the benefit plans. The trustee will vote the shares held in the trust as instructed by the trust’s beneficiaries. The shares held in the trust are not
considered outstanding for earnings-per-share purposes until distributed or sold by the trust in payment of benefit obligations.
Prior to its acquisition by Chevron, Unocal established various grantor trusts to fund obligations under some of its benefit plans, including the
deferred compensation and supplemental retirement plans. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, trust assets of $35 and $36, respectively, were invested
primarily in interest-earning accounts.
Employee Incentive Plans The Chevron Incentive Plan is an annual cash bonus plan for eligible employees that links awards to corporate, business
unit and individual performance in the prior year. Charges to expense for cash bonuses were $1,169, $1,165 and $462 in 2022, 2021 and 2020,
respectively. Chevron also has the LTIP for officers and other regular salaried employees of the company and its subsidiaries who hold positions of
significant responsibility. Awards under the LTIP consist of stock options and other share-based compensation that are described in Note 22 Stock
Options and Other Share-Based Compensation.

Other Contingencies and Commitments
Income Taxes The company calculates its income tax expense and liabilities quarterly. These liabilities generally are subject to audit and are not
finalized with the individual taxing authorities until several years after the end of the annual period for which income taxes have been calculated.
Refer to Note 17 Taxes for a discussion of the periods for which tax returns have been audited for the company’s major tax jurisdictions and a
discussion for all tax jurisdictions of the differences between the amount of tax benefits recognized in the financial statements and the amount taken
or expected to be taken in a tax return.
Settlement of open tax years, as well as other tax issues in countries where the company conducts its businesses, are not expected to have a material
effect on the consolidated financial position or liquidity of the company and, in the opinion of management, adequate provisions have been made for
all years under examination or subject to future examination.
Guarantees The company has one guarantee to an equity affiliate totaling $175. This guarantee is associated with certain payments under a terminal
use agreement entered into by an equity affiliate. Over the approximate 5-year remaining term of this guarantee, the maximum guarantee amount will
be reduced as certain fees are paid by the affiliate. There are numerous cross-indemnity agreements with the affiliate and the other partners to permit
recovery of amounts paid under the guarantee. Chevron has recorded no liability for this guarantee.
Indemnifications The company often includes standard indemnification provisions in its arrangements with its partners, suppliers and vendors in the
ordinary course of business, the terms of which range in duration and sometimes are not limited. The company may be obligated to indemnify such
parties for losses or claims suffered or incurred in connection with its service or other claims made against such parties.
Long-Term Unconditional Purchase Obligations and Commitments, Including Throughput and Take-or-Pay Agreements The company and its
subsidiaries have certain contingent liabilities with respect to long-term unconditional purchase obligations and commitments, including throughput
and take-or-pay agreements, some of which may relate to suppliers’ financing arrangements. The agreements typically provide goods and services,
such as pipeline and storage capacity, utilities, and petroleum products, to be used or sold in the ordinary course of the company’s business. The
aggregate amounts of required payments under throughput and take-or-pay agreements are: 2023 – $897; 2024 – $959; 2025 – $941; 2026 – $1,002;
2027 – $1,053 ; after 2027 – $6,489. The aggregate amount of required payments for other unconditional purchase obligations are: 2023 – $349;
2024 – $425; 2025 – $322; 2026 – $358; 2027 – $311; after 2027 – $1,233. A portion of these commitments may ultimately be shared with project
partners. Total payments under the agreements were $1,866 in 2022, $861 in 2021 and $514 in 2020.
Environmental The company is subject to loss contingencies pursuant to laws, regulations, private claims and legal proceedings related to
environmental matters that are subject to legal settlements or that in the future may require the company to take action to correct or ameliorate the
effects on the environment of prior release of chemicals or petroleum substances by the company or other parties. Such contingencies may exist for
various operating, closed and divested sites,


                                                                          94
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements                                                                                  Financial Table of Contents

including, but not limited to, U.S. federal Superfund sites and analogous sites under state laws, refineries, chemical plants, marketing facilities, crude
oil fields, and mining sites.
Although the company has provided for known environmental obligations that are probable and reasonably estimable, it is likely that the company
will continue to incur additional liabilities. The amount of additional future costs are not fully determinable due to such factors as the unknown
magnitude of possible contamination, the unknown timing and extent of the corrective actions that may be required, the determination of the
company’s liability in proportion to other responsible parties, and the extent to which such costs are recoverable from third parties. These future costs
may be material to results of operations in the period in which they are recognized, but the company does not expect these costs will have a material
effect on its consolidated financial position or liquidity.
Chevron’s environmental reserve as of December 31, 2022, was $868. Included in this balance was $218 related to remediation activities at
approximately 143 sites for which the company had been identified as a potentially responsible party under the provisions of the U.S. federal
Superfund law or analogous state laws which provide for joint and several liability for all responsible parties. Any future actions by regulatory
agencies to require Chevron to assume other potentially responsible parties’ costs at designated hazardous waste sites are not expected to have a
material effect on the company’s results of operations, consolidated financial position or liquidity.
Of the remaining year-end 2022 environmental reserves balance of $650, $384 is related to the company’s U.S. downstream operations, $44 to its
international downstream operations, and $222 to its upstream operations. Liabilities at all sites were primarily associated with the company’s plans
and activities to remediate soil or groundwater contamination or both.
The company manages environmental liabilities under specific sets of regulatory requirements, which in the United States include the Resource
Conservation and Recovery Act and various state and local regulations. No single remediation site at year-end 2022 had a recorded liability that was
material to the company’s results of operations, consolidated financial position or liquidity.
Refer to Note 25 Asset Retirement Obligations for a discussion of the company’s asset retirement obligations.
Other Contingencies Chevron receives claims from and submits claims to customers; trading partners; joint venture partners; U.S. federal, state and
local regulatory bodies; governments; contractors; insurers; suppliers; and individuals. The amounts of these claims, individually and in the
aggregate, may be significant and take lengthy periods to resolve, and may result in gains or losses in future periods.
The company and its affiliates also continue to review and analyze their operations and may close, retire, sell, exchange, acquire or restructure assets
to achieve operational or strategic benefits and to improve competitiveness and profitability. These activities, individually or together, may result in
significant gains or losses in future periods.

Note 25
Asset Retirement Obligations
The company records the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation (ARO) both as an asset and a liability when there is a legal
obligation associated with the retirement of a tangible long-lived asset and the liability can be reasonably estimated. The legal obligation to perform
the asset retirement activity is unconditional, even though uncertainty may exist about the timing and/or method of settlement that may be beyond the
company’s control. This uncertainty about the timing and/or method of settlement is factored into the measurement of the liability when sufficient
information exists to reasonably estimate fair value. Recognition of the ARO includes: (1) the present value of a liability and offsetting asset, (2) the
subsequent accretion of that liability and depreciation of the asset, and (3) the periodic review of the ARO liability estimates and discount rates.
AROs are primarily recorded for the company’s crude oil and natural gas producing assets. No significant AROs associated with any legal
obligations to retire downstream long-lived assets have been recognized, as indeterminate settlement dates for the asset retirements prevent
estimation of the fair value of the associated ARO. The company performs periodic reviews of its downstream long-lived assets for any changes in
facts and circumstances that might require recognition of a retirement obligation.

and sales of inventory with the same counterparty that are entered into in contemplation of one another (including buy/sell arrangements) are
combined and recorded on a net basis and reported in “Purchased crude oil and products” on the Consolidated Statement of Income. Refer to Note 14
Operating Segments and Geographic Data for additional information on the company’s segmentation of revenue.
Receivables related to revenue from contracts with customers are included in “Accounts and notes receivable, net” on the Consolidated Balance
Sheet, net of the allowance for doubtful accounts. The net balance of these receivables was $14,219 and $12,877 at December 31, 2022 and 2021,
respectively. Other items included in “Accounts and notes receivable, net” represent amounts due from partners for their share of joint venture
operating and project costs and amounts due from others, primarily related to derivatives, leases, buy/sell arrangements and product exchanges,
which are accounted for outside the scope of ASC 606.
Contract assets and related costs are reflected in “Prepaid expenses and other current assets” and contract liabilities are reflected in “Accrued
liabilities” and “Deferred credits and other noncurrent obligations” on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Amounts for these items are not material to
the company’s financial position.

Financial Instruments - Credit Losses
Chevron’s expected credit loss allowance balance was $1.0 billion as of December 31, 2022 and $745 million as of December 31, 2021, with a
majority of the allowance relating to non-trade receivable balances.
The majority of the company’s receivable balance is concentrated in trade receivables, with a balance of $18.2 billion as of December 31, 2022,
which reflects the company’s diversified sources of revenues and is dispersed across the company’s broad worldwide customer base. As a result, the
company believes the concentration of credit risk is limited. The company routinely assesses the financial strength of its customers. When the
financial strength of a customer is not considered sufficient, alternative risk mitigation measures may be deployed, including requiring prepayments,
letters of credit or other acceptable forms of collateral. Once credit is extended and a receivable balance exists, the company applies a quantitative
calculation to current trade receivable balances that reflects credit risk predictive analysis, including probability of default and loss given default,
which takes into consideration current and forward-looking market data as well as the company’s historical loss data. This statistical approach
becomes the basis of the company’s expected credit loss allowance for current trade receivables with payment terms that are typically short-term in
nature, with most due in less than 90 days.
Chevron’s non-trade receivable balance was $4.3 billion as of December 31, 2022, which includes receivables from certain governments in their
capacity as joint venture partners. Joint venture partner balances that are paid as per contract terms or not yet due are subject to the statistical analysis
described above while past due balances are subject to additional qualitative management quarterly review. This management review includes review
of reasonable and supportable repayment forecasts. Non-trade receivables also include employee and tax receivables that are deemed immaterial and
low risk. Loans to equity affiliates and non-equity investees are also considered non-trade and associated allowances of $560 million are included
within “Investments and Advances” on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at both December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021.

Acquisition of Renewable Energy Group, Inc.
On June 13, 2022, the company acquired Renewable Energy Group, Inc. (REG), an independent company focused on converting natural fats, oils and
greases into advanced biofuels. REG utilizes a global integrated production, procurement, distribution and logistics network to operate 11
biorefineries in the U.S. and Europe. Ten biorefineries produce biodiesel and one produces renewable diesel. The acquisition combines REG’s
growing renewable fuels production and leading feedstock capabilities with Chevron’s large manufacturing, distribution and commercial marketing
position.
Chevron acquired outstanding shares of REG in an all-cash transaction valued at $3.15 billion, or $61.50 per share. As part of the transaction, the
company recognized long-term debt and finance leases with a fair value of $590 million.
The acquisition was accounted for as a business combination under ASC 805, which requires assets acquired and liabilities assumed to be measured
at their acquisition date fair values. Provisional fair value measurements were made for acquired assets and liabilities, and adjustments to those
measurements may be made in subsequent periods, up to one year from the acquisition date, as information necessary to complete the analysis is
obtained. Tangible and intangible assets were valued using a combination of replacement cost approach and discounted cash flows that incorporated
internally generated price assumptions and production profiles together with appropriate operating and capital cost assumptions. Debt assumed in the

Reserves Governance The company has adopted a comprehensive reserves and resources classification system modeled after a system developed and
approved by a number of organizations, including the Society of Petroleum Engineers, the World Petroleum Congress and the American Association
of Petroleum Geologists. The company classifies discovered recoverable hydrocarbons into six categories based on their status at the time of
reporting – three deemed commercial and three potentially recoverable. Within the commercial classification are proved reserves and two categories
of unproved reserves: probable and possible. The potentially recoverable categories are also referred to as contingent resources. For reserves
estimates to be classified as proved, they must meet all SEC and company standards.
Proved oil and gas reserves are the estimated quantities that geoscience and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be
economically producible in the future from known reservoirs under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations.
Net proved reserves exclude royalties and interests owned by others and reflect contractual arrangements and royalty obligations in effect at the time
of the estimate.
Proved reserves are classified as either developed or undeveloped. Proved developed reserves are the quantities expected to be recovered through
existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods, or in which the cost of the required equipment is relatively minor compared to the cost
of a new well. Proved undeveloped reserves are the quantities expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage or from existing wells
where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion.
Due to the inherent uncertainties and the limited nature of reservoir data, estimates of reserves are subject to change as additional information
becomes available.

Proved reserves are estimated by company asset teams composed of earth scientists and engineers. As part of the internal control process related to
reserves estimation, the company maintains a Reserves Advisory Committee (RAC) that is chaired by the Manager of Global Reserves, an
organization that is separate from the business units that estimate reserves. The Manager of Global Reserves has more than 30 years of experience
working in the oil and gas industry and holds both undergraduate and graduate degrees in geoscience. His experience includes various technical and
management roles in providing reserve and resource estimates in support of major capital and exploration projects, and more than 10 years of
overseeing oil and gas reserves processes. He has been named a Distinguished Lecturer by the American Association of Petroleum Geologists and is
an active member of the American Association of Petroleum Geologists, the SEPM Society of Sedimentary Geologists and the Society of Petroleum
Engineers.
All RAC members are degreed professionals, each with more than 10 years of experience in various aspects of reserves estimation relating to
reservoir engineering, petroleum engineering, earth science or finance. The members are knowledgeable in SEC guidelines for proved reserves
classification and receive annual training on the preparation of reserves estimates.
The RAC has the following primary responsibilities: establish the policies and processes used within the business units to estimate reserves; provide
independent reviews and oversight of the business units’ recommended reserves estimates and changes; confirm that proved reserves are recognized
in accordance with SEC guidelines; determine that reserve quantities are calculated using consistent and appropriate standards, procedures and
technology; and maintain the Chevron Corporation Reserves Manual, which provides standardized procedures used corporatewide for classifying
and reporting hydrocarbon reserves.
During the year, the RAC is represented in meetings with each of the company’s business units to review and discuss reserve changes recommended
by the various asset teams. Major changes are also reviewed with the company’s senior leadership team including the Chief Executive Officer and the
Chief Financial Officer. The company’s annual reserve activity is also reviewed with the Board of Directors. If major changes to reserves were to
occur between the annual reviews, those matters would also be discussed with the Board.
RAC subteams also conduct in-depth reviews during the year of many of the fields that have large proved reserves quantities. These reviews include
an examination of the proved reserve records and documentation of their compliance with the Chevron Corporation Reserves Manual.
Technologies Used in Establishing Proved Reserves Additions In 2022, additions to Chevron’s proved reserves were based on a wide range of
geologic and engineering technologies. Information generated from wells, such as well logs, wire line sampling, production and pressure testing,
fluid analysis, and core analysis, was integrated with seismic data, regional geologic studies, and information from analogous reservoirs to provide
“reasonably certain” proved reserves estimates. Both proprietary and commercially available analytic tools, including reservoir simulation, geologic
modeling and seismic processing, have been used in the interpretation of the subsurface data. These technologies have been utilized extensively by
the company in the past, and the company believes that they provide a high degree of confidence in establishing reliable and consistent reserves
estimates.

In 2022, revisions include an increase of 257 million BOE in Israel, due to new wells and performance revisions in the Leviathan and Tamar fields.
This increase was largely offset by decreases of 145 million BOE from the United States primarily from portfolio optimizations in the Midland and
Delaware basins, 69 million BOE in Kazakhstan primarily at TCO as higher prices reduced entitlement (Entitlement effects) and changes in operating
assumptions reduced estimated

undeveloped reserves, and 31 million BOE in Nigeria due to lower expected offtake of natural gas relative to contracted volumes.
In 2022, extensions and discoveries of 578 million BOE in the United States were primarily due to the increase of activity and planned development
of new locations in shale and tight assets in the Midland, Delaware and DJ basins. In Other Americas, 34 million BOE of extensions and discoveries
were from shale and tight assets in Argentina and Canada.
The difference in 2022 extensions and discoveries of 122 million BOE, between the net quantities of proved reserves of 754 million BOE as reflected
on pages 107 to 109 and net quantities of proved undeveloped reserves of 632 million BOE, is primarily due to proved extensions and discoveries
that were not recognized as proved undeveloped reserves in the prior year and were recognized directly as proved developed reserves in 2022.
Purchases of 61 million BOE in 2022 are primarily from the acquisition of various properties in the Midland and Delaware basins in the United
States.
Transfers to proved developed reserves in 2022 include 309 million BOE in the United States, primarily from the Midland, Delaware and DJ basin
developments, 207 million BOE in Australia, and 141 million BOE in Kazakhstan, Angola, Canada, Argentina and other international locations.
These transfers are the consequence of development expenditures on completing wells and facilities.
During 2022, investments totaling approximately $7.5 billion in oil and gas producing activities and about $0.1 billion in non-oil and gas producing
activities were expended to advance the development of proved undeveloped reserves. The United States accounted for about $3.7 billion primarily
related to various development activities in the Midland and Delaware basins and the Gulf of Mexico. In Asia, expenditures during the year totaled
approximately $2.6 billion, primarily related to development projects for TCO in Kazakhstan. An additional $0.2 billion were spent on development
activities in Australia. In Africa, about $0.5 billion was expended on various offshore development and natural gas projects in Nigeria, Angola and
Republic of Congo. Development activities in Canada and other international locations were primarily responsible for about $0.5 billion of
expenditures.
Reserves that remain proved undeveloped for five or more years are a result of several factors that affect optimal project development and execution.
These factors may include the complex nature of the development project in adverse and remote locations, physical limitations of infrastructure or
plant capacities that dictate project timing, compression projects that are pending reservoir pressure declines, and contractual limitations that dictate
production levels.
At year-end 2022, the company held approximately 1.3 billion BOE of proved undeveloped reserves that have remained undeveloped for five years
or more. The majority of these reserves are in locations where the company has a proven track record of developing major projects. In Australia,
approximately 235 million BOE remain undeveloped for five years or more related to the Gorgon and Wheatstone Projects. Further field
development to convert the remaining proved undeveloped reserves is scheduled to occur in line with operating constraints, reservoir depletion and
infrastructure optimization. In Africa, approximately 167 million BOE have remained undeveloped for five years or more, primarily due to facility
constraints at various fields and infrastructure associated with the Escravos gas projects in Nigeria. Affiliates account for about 776 million BOE of
proved undeveloped reserves with about 726 million BOE that have remained undeveloped for five years or more. Approximately 647 million BOE
are related to TCO in Kazakhstan and about 79 million BOE are related to Angola LNG. At TCO and Angola LNG, further field development to
convert the remaining proved undeveloped reserves is scheduled to occur in line with reservoir depletion and facility constraints.
Annually, the company assesses whether any changes have occurred in facts or circumstances, such as changes to development plans, regulations, or
government policies, that would warrant a revision to reserve estimates. In 2022, improvements in commodity prices positively impacted the
economic limits of oil and gas properties, resulting in proved reserve increases, and negatively impacted proved reserves due to entitlement effects.
The year-end reserves quantities have been updated for these circumstances and significant changes have been discussed in the appropriate reserves
sections. Over the past three years, the ratio of proved undeveloped reserves to total proved reserves has ranged between 31 percent and 35 percent.
Proved Reserve Quantities For the three years ending December 31, 2022, the pattern of net reserve changes shown in the following tables are not
necessarily indicative of future trends. Apart from acquisitions, the company’s ability to add proved reserves can be affected by events and
circumstances that are outside the company’s control, such as delays in government permitting, partner approvals of development plans, changes in
oil and gas prices, OPEC constraints, geopolitical uncertainties, and civil unrest.

At December 31, 2022, proved reserves for the company were 11.2 billion BOE. The company’s estimated net proved reserves of liquids, including
crude oil, condensate and synthetic oil for the years 2020, 2021 and 2022, are shown in the table on page 107. The company’s estimated net proved
reserves of natural gas liquids are shown on page 108, and the company’s estimated net proved reserves of natural gas are shown on page 109.
Noteworthy changes in crude oil, condensate and synthetic oil proved reserves for 2020 through 2022 are discussed below and shown in the table on
the following page:
Revisions In 2020, capital reductions and commodity price effects in the Midland and Delaware basins and Anchor in the Gulf of Mexico were
primarily responsible for the 279 million barrels decrease in the United States. Reserves in Venezuela affiliates decreased by 149 million barrels,
primarily due to impairments and accounting methodology change. Entitlement effects and performance revisions in TCO were primarily responsible
for the 180 million barrels increase. Entitlement effects primarily contributed to an increase of 77 million barrels of synthetic oil at the Athabasca Oil
Sands in Canada and 74 million barrels at multiple locations in Asia.
In 2021, the 206 million barrels increase in United States was primarily in the Gulf of Mexico and the Midland and Delaware basins. The higher
commodity price environment led to the increase of 126 million barrels in the Gulf of Mexico primarily from Anchor and a 68 million barrels
increase in the Midland and Delaware basins due to higher planned development activity. In TCO, entitlement effects and technical changes in field
operating assumptions, reservoir model, and project schedule were primarily responsible for the 208 million barrels decrease in Kazakhstan.
Entitlement effects primarily contributed to a decrease of 106 million barrels of synthetic oil at the Athabasca Oil Sands project in Canada. In the
Other Americas, performance revisions and price effects, mainly in Canada and Argentina, were primarily responsible for the 41 million barrels
increase.
In 2022, entitlement effects primarily contributed to a decrease of 49 million barrels of synthetic oil at the Athabasca Oil Sands project in Canada. In
TCO, entitlement effects and changes in operating assumptions were primarily responsible for the 35 million barrels decrease in Kazakhstan.
Extensions and Discoveries In 2020, extensions and discoveries in the Midland and Delaware basins were primarily responsible for the 105 million
barrels increase in the United States.
In 2021, extensions and discoveries in the Midland and Delaware basins, and at the Whale Project in the Gulf of Mexico, were primarily responsible
for the 349 million barrels increase in the United States.
In 2022, extensions and discoveries in the Midland, Delaware and DJ basins, and approval of the Ballymore Project in the Gulf of Mexico, were
primarily responsible for the 264 million barrels increase in the United States. In Other Americas, the 32 million barrels of extensions and discoveries
were from Argentina and Canada.
Purchases In 2020, the acquisition of Noble assets contributed 227 million barrels in the DJ basin, Midland and Delaware basins in the United States.
In 2022, the company exercised its option to acquire additional land acreage in the Athabasca Oil Sands project in Canada contributing 168 million
barrels in synthetic oil. The extension of deepwater licenses in Nigeria and the Republic of Congo contributed 36 million barrels in Africa.

Noteworthy changes in natural gas liquids proved reserves for 2020 through 2022 are discussed below and shown in the table on the following page:
Revisions In 2020, capital reductions and commodity price effects in various fields in Midland and Delaware basins were primarily responsible for
the 71 million barrels decrease in the United States.
In 2021, higher commodity prices resulting in the increase of planned development activity in the Midland and Delaware basins were primarily
responsible for the 107 million barrels increase in the United States.
Extensions and Discoveries In 2020, extensions and discoveries in various fields in Midland and Delaware basins were primarily responsible for the
60 million barrels increase in the United States.
In 2021, extensions and discoveries in the Midland and Delaware basins were primarily responsible for the 190 million barrels increase in the United
States.
In 2022, extensions and discoveries in the Midland and Delaware basins were primarily responsible for the 163 million barrels increase in the United
States.
Purchases In 2020, the acquisition of Noble assets contributed 198 million barrels primarily in the DJ basin, Midland and Delaware basins and Eagle
Ford shale in the United States.
Sales In 2022, sales of 35 million barrels in the United States were primarily from the divestment of the Eagle Ford shale assets and some properties
in the Midland and Delaware basins.

Noteworthy changes in natural gas proved reserves for 2020 through 2022 are discussed below and shown in the table on the following page:
Revisions In 2020, the demotion of Jansz Io compression project reserves and lower field performance, partially offset by positive revisions at
Gorgon, were mainly responsible for the net 2.5 TCF decrease in Australia. Capital reductions and commodity price effects in various fields of the
Midland and Delaware basins were mainly responsible for the 509 BCF decrease in the United States. In Africa, a 229 BCF decrease was primarily
due to reduced demand and development plan changes at Meren in Nigeria.
In 2021, the approval of the Jansz Io Compression project was mainly responsible for the 1.2 TCF increase in Australia. Higher commodity prices,
resulting in the increase of planned development activity in the Midland and Delaware basins, were mainly responsible for the 829 BCF increase in
the United States. In TCO, entitlement effects and technical changes in field operating assumptions, reservoir model, and project schedule were
primarily responsible for the 179 BCF decrease.
In 2022, the performance of the Leviathan and Tamar fields in Israel and the Bibiyana and Jalalabad fields in Bangladesh were mainly responsible for
the 1.8 TCF increase in Asia. In Australia, the 377 BCF decrease was mainly due to updated reservoir characterization of the Wheatstone field. In
TCO, entitlement effects and changes in operating assumptions were primarily responsible for the 285 BCF decrease.
Extensions and Discoveries In 2020, extensions and discoveries of 385 BCF in the United States were primarily in the Midland and Delaware basins.
In 2021, extensions and discoveries of 1.4 TCF in the United States were primarily in the Midland and Delaware basins.
In 2022, extensions and discoveries of 1.6 TCF in the United States were primarily in the Midland and Delaware basins.

Purchases In 2020, the acquisition of Noble assets contributed 5.4 TCF in Israel in Asia, 1.5 TCF in the DJ basin, Midland and Delaware basins and
Eagle Ford Shale in the United States and 441 BCF in Equatorial Guinea in Africa.
Sales In 2020, sales of 1.3 TCF were primarily in the Appalachian basin in the United States and 264 BCF primarily in Azerbaijan in Asia.
In 2022, sales of 243 BCF in the United States were primarily in the Eagle Ford shale and Midland and Delaware basins.

Table VI - Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows Related to Proved Oil and Gas Reserves
The standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows is calculated in accordance with SEC and FASB requirements. This includes using the
average of first-day-of-the-month oil and gas prices for the 12-month period prior to the end of the reporting period, estimated future development
and production costs assuming the continuation of existing economic conditions, estimated costs for asset retirement obligations (includes costs to
retire existing wells and facilities in addition to those future wells and facilities necessary to produce proved undeveloped reserves), and estimated
future income taxes based on appropriate statutory tax rates. Discounted future net cash flows are calculated using 10 percent mid-period discount
factors. Estimates of proved reserve quantities are imprecise and change over time as new information becomes available. Probable and possible
reserves, which may become proved in the future, are excluded from the calculations. The valuation requires assumptions as to the timing and
amount of future development and production costs. The calculations are made as of December 31 each year and do not represent management’s
estimate of the company’s future cash flows or value of its oil and gas reserves. In the following table, the caption “Standardized Measure Net Cash
Flows” refers to the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows.
